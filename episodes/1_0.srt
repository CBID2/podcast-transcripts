2
00:24:00,000 --> 00:28:00,00
Bekah: Virtual Coffee is an intimate group of developers at all stages of their coding journey, 

3
00:29:00,00 --> 00:38:00,00
Bekah: And we're here to share that with you. 
Here with me today is my co host, Dan, how's it going Dan?

00:39:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Dan Ott: It's going pretty good. Thanks, Becca. 
Today, we have a great episode. We're going to hear from Nick Taylor.  

5
00:46:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Dan: Nick is a Software Engineer at Forum, the company behind Dev. 
He's a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React,  Preact, and Node. 

6
00:57:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Dan: Once upon a time, he was into C# and ASP.net.
Aside from programming, he enjoys hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long, long time ago, Rugby. 

7
01:07:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Dan: Nick is also one of our first members.
He's been in Virtual Coffee since nearly the beginning. 

8
01:12:00,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Dan: He's [Nick] helped us out in many ways. 
 He's been a note taker, and a room leader, a mentor, and open source maintainer and an all around awesome human being.


9
01:22:00,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Dan: So Nick is going to talk about live streaming and open source 
And he will share with us his approach to life which he calls structured YOLO.

10
01:30:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Bekah: We start every episode like we start every virtual coffee
We introduce ourselves with our name, where we're from what we do and a random check in question. 

11
01:41:00,000 --> 01:45:00,000 
Bekah: Today's question is 
What is one thing that are you afraid of? 

12
01:46:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Dan: We hope you enjoy this episode of Virtual Coffee podcast 

13
01:59:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Bekah: Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end developer from a small town in Ohio.
And one of my biggest fears is waffle bridges. 

14
02:08:00,00 --> 02:17:00,000
Dan: Hi I am Dan. I am a front end developer from Clevland, Ohio.
And one of my biggest fears is hornets.
15
02:17:00,01 --> 02:19:00,000
Nick Taylor: Hornets[silence]
Dan: Don't like them [silence] yeah 
16
02:20:00,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Nick: My name is Nick Taylor. I'm a senior software engineer at Forem
And I say one of my biggest fears is heights. 

17
02:31:02,000 --> 02:42:00,000
 Nick: I am not a fan of heights.
 I remember in grade six, 
 I cried at the bottom of the CN Tower because I had a hard time going up. 



18
02:44:00,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Nick: And it was traumatic 
Bekah: [giggles] Oh no


19
02:47:00,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Nick: So you wanna know how I ended up?
Bekah: Yeah, yeah. Let's start with your origin story. 

20
02:51:00,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Bekah: How'd you get into programming?
Nick: Uhh [pauses] I don't know. 

21
02:55:01,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Nick: I feel like it's a [pauses] classic story 
Of uhh [pauses] somebody who has no idea what they wanna do.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,179
**Do tomorrow** 

23
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,270
software development. Because
think of a recipe is kind of

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,060
like building a website, like,
"Oh, I know I need this piece.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,480
But what if I don't know how to
do this piece? I'll go look it

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,750
up, go watch a YouTube video."
And then eventually, you get to

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,060
a place where you're like,
comfortable. "Oh, I can make

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,484
cookies now without looking at
the recipe. I can make this, I

29
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,908
can

30
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,979
do -- I can create a modal, I
can do the CSS Grid without

31
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,049
really

32
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,609
having to go to the
documentation every single

33
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,169
time."

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,480
Bekah: And Tori Crawford about
the problems of

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,010
interviewing in the industry.

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,590
Tori Crawford: Interviewing was
crazy for me. I think I went

37
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,930
through 53 interviews. Yeah, it
was, like, quite a struggle at

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,620
times.

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,500
Dan: You also get a special
bonus episode that we recorded

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,969
live after Hacktoberfest.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,060
Kirk Shillingford: Hacktoberfest
happened because we were like,

42
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,140
"Hey, we wanna do something
good," you know? And then people

43
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,349
were like, "I don't wanna do
this with strangers, but I

44
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,879
wouldn't mind doing it with-
with everybody here." And I

45
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,409
think

46
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,339
that's like very important.
Like, I wouldn't have done this

47
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,269
with

48
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:05,750
people who I didn't consider,
like, friends, and good people.

49
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,020
Bekah: Best of all, you'll get
to hear so much

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,479
of the heart that goes into the
community. And we're very

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,800
excited to share that with you.

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,539
