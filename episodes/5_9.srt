8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:24,414
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,928
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

10
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:27,442
it with

11
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:31,583

co-host, Dan, and everybody's

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,084
favorite maintainer, Kirk.

13
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:39,476
Dan: Hello! Welcome to our
season finale of Season 5. As we

14
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,591
traditionally do, we have Kirk
on to hang out with us because

15
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,706
we

16
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:47,877
all love Kirk very much. And we
are going to talk about some

17
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:53,286
choices we made with- with
Virtual Coffee and some feedback

18
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,606
we've had over the last few
months, and what we have

19
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:00,336
going on in the future. So, glad
as always to have Kirk here.

20
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:03,066
And,

21
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,626
yeah, it's gonna be fun.

22
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:07,861
Bekah: Yeah. And we're gonna
start off this episode of the

23
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:12,001
podcast like we start off every
Virtual Coffee. We'll introduce

24
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,811
ourselves with our name, where
we're from, what we do, and a

25
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:27,832
random check-in question. We
hope you enjoy this episode. Our

26
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:30,547
question today is, what was your
favorite game to play as a

27
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:33,262
child?

28
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:37,362
My name is Bekah. I'm a
technical community builder from

29
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:39,881
a small

30
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:42,247
town in Ohio, and my favorite
game to play as a child -- I

31
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,612
mean,

32
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,922
like, due to I grew up to --
here, I really loved Othello, so

33
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:49,182
I played

34
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:53,263
a lot of Othello with my dad.
And then I'm gonna go outdoor

35
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,612
games. We also played a lot of
kickball and badminton in my

36
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,923
backyard. So I can't really
decide between kickball and

37
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:04,332
badminton, but I have very fond
memories of all of those things.

38
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,158
Dan: All right, so you're going
three games.

39
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,143
Bekah: Yeah. Okay. I can do what
I want, right [laughs]?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,858
Dan: What are your three
favorite games [laughs]?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Kirk Shillingford: Pick your
favorite game. It doesn't mean

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,000
--

43
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:12,973
Bekah: You get one, Dan.

44
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:18,273
Dan: [Laughs] Hi, I'm Dan. You
all know who I am. My favorite

45
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:22,318
game ... I don't

46
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,518
know. This is like when my mind
just to the next --

47
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,077
Bekah: Wait- wait a minute. You
said, "We -- you all know who I

48
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,382
am." [Dan laughs] What if you
have a

49
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,092
first time listener here, okay?

50
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,408
Dan: Okay. Well, first time
listener. Well, I'm Dan. I live

51
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,518
in Cleveland. I make

52
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,918
websites stuff with code.
Sometimes in front end -- most

53
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,258
of the time,

54
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,858
front end, sometimes back end. I
do a lot of other things too.

55
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:44,622
And it's all on my computer [Dan
and Bekah laugh]. I'm sorry. I'm

56
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,907
having trouble

57
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:48,897
today. All right.

58
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,672
Bekah: You should participated
in the monthly challenge last

59
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,667
month for the elevator pitch. I

60
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:54,598
think it would have helped you-

61
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:55,457
Kirk: No, that's the perfect
[unintelligible]-

62
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,548
Bekah: -refine your intro.

63
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:57,807
Dan: I should have.

64
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:58,518
Kirk: -angel word.

65
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:08,728
Dan: I- I make computer things
[chuckles].

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Kirk: Real quick.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,373
Dan: So, games as a child ... we
had this- we had this board game

68
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:15,746
called Omega Virus-

69
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:15,758
Bekah: Yes! Yes, yes, Omega
Virus.

70
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:16,592
Dan: -is the first thing that
popped in mind. You know Omega

71
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,426
Virus?

72
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:17,627
Bekah: Yes!

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dan: [Chuckles] Oh my god.
That's amazing.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,729
Bekah: I think I accidentally
called Omicron, Omega virus

75
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,458
[laughs] one time in public. And
somebody was like, "What?"

76
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,187
[laughs].

77
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:26,967
Dan: [Laughs] It's amazing!
Okay. So that game was really

78
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,347
fun. I- I

79
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:29,338
mean, I don't even know if it's
a good game, but it had -- you

80
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,328
know,

81
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,127
a guy that yelled at you, and
robots, and stuff. And so it

82
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:33,926
was-

83
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:35,907
it was fun. That was the first
thing that popped in my mind. So

84
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,687
we played lots of games growing
up. But that one has

85
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,094
a special place, you know, in my
heart. So ... for my one

86
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:44,501
favorite game, I'm picking

87
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:45,173
Omega Virus.

88
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,000
Bekah: I was the one -- I wanna
add another one.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dan: Cuz I thought the rules --

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,946
Bekah: Number four. Computer
game, loved Monkey Island, and

91
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,892
it's coming back. And

92
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,109
I'm so excited about that. So,
now I'm done. Go ahead, Kirk

93
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,325
[chuckles].

94
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:00,028
Kirk: By so many thoughts, the
thought of a trailer for a

95
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,845
Monkey

96
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:04,406
Island, it's so strange. It
looks like the strangest game in

97
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,966
the

98
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,660
world. And then I said, "Of
course, Bekah likes this. [Bekah

99
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,354
laughs] You know, craps."

100
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:17,906
Games that I liked as a child is
you're-not-leaving-this-table-

101
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:21,985
until-you-eat-these-vegetables-
jokes-on-you. I have a book. A

102
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:26,755
game. Because me and my mom
played that a lot. And I won a

103
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,867
lot, like, "Just get to finish
your food," and I'm like, "I'm

104
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,979
just

105
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,085
gonna read until we get bored,
and I'm gonna go [chuckles]".

106
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:37,190
Okay.

107
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,100
Bekah: [Chuckles] It's not a
real game.

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,281
Kirk: It's a real game, and I'm
the champion. Board games,

109
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,950
Risk is -- I know a lot of
people hate Risk. I love Risk.

110
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,230
I'm super

111
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,470
into roll those dice, fighting
those armies, you know? I own --

112
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,710
I

113
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,463
love -- I got beaten up at Risk
by, like, an 86 year old woman.

114
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,215
And I sort

115
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,390
of like dedicated six months of
my life [chuckles] to revenge on

116
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,564
the board

117
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:12,485
game, not -- you know. So, Risk
is pretty big ... computer

118
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:15,538
games? There's this really --
this is computer game called DX

119
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:18,591
Ball. And

120
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,225
it's basically just like
glorified, like, Pong. It was

121
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,859
like

122
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,335
super Pong. And if I, like, get
200 levels, there were

123
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,810
explosions and

124
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,630
it was like a real -- there's a
lot going on there. I really

125
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,970
liked that.

126
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,271
That was really fun. And I also
remember at the age of seven, my

127
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,271
mom

128
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,750
got me like a Reader Rabbit.
Learn math on the computer CD

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,990
cuz that seemed like a great
idea. And it immediately crashed

130
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,015
our computer and it like never
turned back on. So, I don't know

131
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,040
what the

132
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,230
life lesson there is. Don't
[unintelligible]-

133
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,850
Bekah: There's a lot of Reader
Rabbit.

134
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,687
Kirk: -your children arithmetic.
Those are my answers.

135
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,347
Dan: I -- all right. I'm gonna
add -- I'm having an addict- an

136
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:00,937
addition. I thought about --

137
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,158
I remembered Wolfenstein on a
computer game.

138
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:03,913
Bekah: Yeah -- no. You're not
allowed.

139
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,673
Dan: Yeah. Wolfenstein is
awesome.

140
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:06,372
Bekah: Sorry. Take it back.
You're done.

141
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,867
Dan: So I played that lot.

142
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,627
Kirk: Out of the things, you
fire this? [??]

143
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,612
Bekah: Yeah. Well, Dan's in
trouble, so he doesn't get all

144
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,172
of

145
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,174
the things [laughs].

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Dan: In trouble [chuckles].

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bekah: Being punished.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Dan: For what?

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Bekah: I won [chuckles].

150
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,259
Dan: I don't even know what I
did.

151
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,889
Kirk: Well, I don't really swift
the -- you know, a no old game

152
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:23,829
of Othello or something.

153
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,034
Dan: Othello was pretty cool
too. I liked the artists. I

154
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:30,039
don't

155
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,809
know if they all do, but ours
had like a felt boarders, you

156
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,578
know?

157
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:33,579
Bekah: Yeah.

158
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,945
Dan: Okay. Yeah. That's cool. I
don't know. I appreciate that it

159
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,160
had -- oh, I thought I had a- I
had a really nice tactical feel

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,375
to it

161
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,944
that the pieces in the- in the
felt and stuff.

162
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,529
Bekah: Yeah. I started playing
it with my 12-year-old, but

163
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,253
then,

164
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,654
like, one of the other kids got
ahold of it. And so now we don't

165
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:53,334
have all of the chips. So from
-- Backgammon. I like Backgammon

166
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,745
too. I like games.

167
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,394
Dan: I never learned how to play
Backgammon.

168
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,500
Kirk: I had one of those chess
boards. It was like chess on top

169
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,435
and then back-end low. So below
was just like -- it was like in

170
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,370
the

171
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,879
"Lion King". Like, just don't go
there cuz it's bad.

172
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:08,064
Dan: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah, same.

173
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,000
Bekah: The dad will die
[chuckles].

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,207
Dan: I played the -- I played
chess a lot, and never played

175
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,414
Backgammon,

176
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,134
and never ... I dunno. I --

177
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,935
Bekah: We have very cool
Backgammon suit- it was like a

178
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,405
suitcase. It looked like a small
suitcase and then we were like

179
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,875
pop

180
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,225
open. It was very nice.

181
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,071
Kirk: I played to defeat my
father. Like, I only -- I found

182
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,395
the game. I pressed

183
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:31,007
him every day for months and he
would beat me every day. And so

184
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,331
the day I beat him, and then ...
it was like the happiest day of

185
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,655
my

186
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,669
life [chuckles]. And then we
kept playing until it was pretty

187
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,682
even who

188
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,541
would win. And then he was like,
"I'm not playing anymore

189
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,400
[laughs]." The

190
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,956
whole point of being here is it
I beat you at being

191
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,511
[unintelligible] or all the way
around? And that's

192
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,836
pretty much the last time I
played chess. I did what I set

193
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,160
out to accomplish.

194
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,091
Bekah: Okay. But, we are not
here to talk about games the

195
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,461
entire

196
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,034
time, although that might be a
fun episode [chuckles]. So, we

197
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,607
put it out

198
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,336
there to the Virtual Coffee
community, what they wanted to

199
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:13,716
hear about. And I think they
wanted to hear about what we had

200
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:17,497
as our back pocket topic anyway.
So, today we're gonna be

201
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,826
talking about our decision to
pause membership with Virtual

202
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:25,596
Coffee, the things that we've
been doing and what we see for

203
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,261
the future. So, Kirk, do you
wanna give a little bit of a

204
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,926
recap

205
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,427
of where we're at?

206
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:36,062
Kirk: Yeah. I think how it can
be sort of like summing up

207
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,956
of the- the concise way.
Membership -- incoming members

208
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,850
has

209
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:46,892
been paused with the Virtual
Coffee community for a couple of

210
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:54,062
months now. This -- the decision
was not made lightly. We spent a

211
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,187
lot of time thinking about it
and trying to figure out if

212
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:56,312
there was

213
00:08:56,312 --> 00:09:00,601
like another way to not have to
do that, to sort of like get the

214
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:06,662
desired outcomes. But I think we
just realized, the only way we

215
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,626
were gonna sort of keep things
okay for our volunteers, and

216
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,590
also

217
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:16,971
just like give us the bandwidth
to make things better for

218
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,266
incoming members, was to take a
pause, right? And it's- it's

219
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,561
like one

220
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,072
of those real -- you know,
sometimes like you just have to

221
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:26,496
make priorities when you do not
have internet resources. And

222
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:27,830
that

223
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:31,552
was a decision we made, and I
think it was the right one. I

224
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:34,011
think -- we think it was the
right one. As it's given us a

225
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,470
lot of space to

226
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:38,473
really go with like, "Hey, when
we open back up, what do we

227
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:40,475
wanna

228
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:43,356
do? What do we want this to be?"
Think back to what our

229
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:46,596
mission is. Think back to like
what's working well, what's not

230
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:50,616
working well, how can we empower
the parts that are, like, really

231
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:54,456
valuable for people, one of the
stress points or the pain points

232
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:58,836
that we can, like, reduce. So, I
think that's been good. And I

233
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:03,736
guess there's a little bit there
about having the ability to do

234
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:08,206
that type of thing, being just
like a friendly community, but

235
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,676
also, you know, not- not a
service or a product or

236
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,146
something. It- it makes

237
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:16,147
it easier for us to say like,
"Yeah. We can- we can still just

238
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,957
like be us for a little bit
before we start be in -- out of

239
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,767
cast, be with

240
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,256
people again."

241
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,346
Bekah: Yeah. And I think during
the time, right, after we

242
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,446
decided

243
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,086
to pause membership, we were
nominated for most welcoming,

244
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:32,866
new -- most welcoming developer
community, which we did win

245
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:37,907
at the DevRel Award, which was
really fun. But I- I know that

246
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:39,409
that was, you know, there-
there's probably a hesitancy,

247
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,911
like, "How

248
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:44,211
can you be the most welcoming
community and not be having new

249
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:49,432
members at this point?" And for
me, I felt like it further

250
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:52,807
ensured that we are a welcoming
community because we're taking

251
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,756
the time to figure out how we
can best welcome people, how we

252
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,705
can

253
00:10:56,706 --> 00:11:02,106
continue to welcome our existing
members. And in the last year,

254
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,297
I've talked to a lot of
different, small community

255
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,321
builders, and I've seen them,
you know, fold or say like,

256
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,345
"Hey,

257
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:11,024
we're gonna stop doing this
because we're burnt out and

258
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:13,371
we're

259
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,912
just gonna send everybody to
Virtual Coffee. And it's- it's

260
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,432
like a house of cards, right?
Like, one small community folds

261
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,201
and then all of the people go to
the next small community, into

262
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,911
the

263
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:25,701
next. And so, we wanted to make
sure that- that we weren't

264
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:30,621
falling with- with those other
small communities, which I-

265
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,481
I don't think that we felt that
we were, but you can definitely

266
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:34,341
see

267
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:36,689
that coming down the line. So,
for us, it was super important

268
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,037
to be

269
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:43,267
able to think through all of
these processes, exactly like

270
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,876
what Kirk said, like, you know,
what makes Virtual Coffee

271
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:49,417
special? How do we preserve that
intimacy and how do we scale

272
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:49,746
that?

273
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:51,641
Dan: Yeah. I don't really have
anything to add. I mean, you

274
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,735
both- you both

275
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,647
kind of hit all the- all the
points that we were thinking

276
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,897
about it, you know? And I'm --
our- our- our growth chart or

277
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,147
whatever. We

278
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,571
don't actually have growth chart
[laughs], but like, you know,

279
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,995
you- you can just --

280
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,241
when you're in the community,
you can get a sense of it. And

281
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,486
it's --

282
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:10,192
you know, it- it was increasing
rapidly, you know, and -- which

283
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:11,886
is cool, obviously, in one- in
one part. And we- we all very

284
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,580
much

285
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:17,001
want more people to be joining
again. Like, we're all, I think,

286
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,552
very excited about getting back
to the place where we can open

287
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,631
membership again. And that's
just a matter of building up

288
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:26,657
our ... you know, different
resources, building up our

289
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:28,157
processes, and- and figuring out
some- some paths for, you know,

290
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,657
how we wanna

291
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:35,986
handle things. We have -- just
recently, we took two

292
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:37,981
steps. We- we did one thing
where we were able to highlight

293
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,976
our

294
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,067
members that are, you know,
giving back to the community by

295
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,417
volunteering and in leadership
positions or- or just helping

296
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,677
out in

297
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,947
different roles on our website.
So, on virtualcoffee.io/members

298
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:55,162
now, anybody who's -- who has
... you know, who's-

299
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:56,451
who's actively helping with the
community has- has a little tag,

300
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,740
you

301
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,201
know, based on what they're
doing. Things like room leaders,

302
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:03,111
and note takers, and, you know,
the -- our-our monthly challenge

303
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:05,991
team,

304
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:10,971
and everybody else. And then
after that, we have been working

305
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,792
last a little bit ... I dunno,
the last couple months, I guess,

306
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:20,371
on describing better ways that
people can- can join to help.

307
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,441
Because we've been kind of just
grabbing people [laughs],

308
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,480
mostly, to- to

309
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:27,991
help. And they've been, you know
-- everybody has been amazing.

310
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:29,626
But to support more and more
people, like, we need -- like,

311
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,230
if

312
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,611
we're going to scale, the
volunteers need to scale first

313
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:38,401
before the- before the members.
Do -- you know, the- the -- if

314
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,130
you just take

315
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:46,537
our- our coffee meetings, for
example, we have awesome

316
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:50,856
team of room leaders and note
takers, and they do a great job,

317
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,157
but there's a limited amount of
them, right? And so, that means

318
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,677
there's a limited amount of
people that we can actually have

319
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,917
at the meetings. And it's not
that high [laughs], honestly.

320
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:03,157
And so,

321
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,547
the -- so, what we wanted to do,
okay. How do we get more room

322
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,946
leaders and- and also hosts? So
up until ... yesterday -- so,

323
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,345
we're

324
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,656
recording on- on Friday the
13th, and so yesterday was the

325
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,966
first

326
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,721
day that we had -- not a
maintainer. Host, one of our

327
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,476
coffees.

328
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:19,476
Bekah: MC.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,513
Dan: MC. Sorry. I- I say host.
See, this is why -- it's a- it's

330
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,026
a bad name for it. But- but
like, the --

331
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,172
Bekah: We're also working on
titles [laughs].

332
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,277
Dan: Right. We're working on
titles. But what I mean is,

333
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:28,267
yeah,

334
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:32,407
MC. I-I-I always called host in
my head cuz that's what I

335
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,956
think of, but the person who's
running the coffee meeting,

336
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:37,061
that- that is talking to
everybody. And- and it was Suze,

337
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,975
and she did

338
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:42,096
an awesome job. But that- that
sort of thing is we can't

339
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:45,111
just ... we- we- we feel very
strongly that we want these to

340
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,126
be good

341
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:50,181
experiences, and they always
are. But they -- that- that-

342
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,236
that's because we

343
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,956
put a lot of thought into the MC
stuff, and the room leaders,

344
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:57,261
and all -- everything like that.
And so, we need to make sure

345
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,566
that people

346
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:03,532
are supported and have what they
need to, you know,

347
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,287
bring good- good experiences to
all the other people. And so --

348
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,042
as sort of

349
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,172
like a top-down scaling
situation [chuckles] for us. And

350
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,302
so, that's one of

351
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,057
the, like, big reasons we needed
to -- we- we felt we- we should-

352
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:14,812
we should

353
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,572
be pausing membership was- was
that. And it's been -- we've

354
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:22,042
gotten a lot of good responses
from people. Yeah. I

355
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:22,956
don't know if I actually said
this out loud [chuckles], but we

356
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:23,870
made some-

357
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,676
some ... like documents, and
forms, and stuffs to- to make it

358
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,121
easier

359
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,806
for people to- to- to volunteer
for us and -- for Virtual

360
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,491
Coffee. So, that was

361
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,526
the- that was the -- our next
step. And that's been going

362
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:36,561
well. I don't know.

363
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,162
Bekah: And I think that makes it
easier for us. Because like you

364
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,482
said before, there wasn't a
clear process, and even we'd

365
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,802
have

366
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:43,737
members like, "Oh, I wanna help.
How can I help?" And so much of

367
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,672
--

368
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,666
because Virtual Coffee was not
an intentionally planned

369
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,601
community,

370
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:52,511
it's always been like keeping up
with the needs of the community,

371
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,341
the excitement of the community,
and doing all these cool and fun

372
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,341
things. And I think we've done a
pretty good job of keeping up

373
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:02,991
with processes, but things like
that, like what- what do we

374
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:06,142
need help with? And I don't
think that's something that's

375
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,951
particularly a Virtual Coffee
problem. I think that anybody

376
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,103
who's running a community, if-
if you don't have things set up,

377
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,255
you --

378
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,896
like, you know that you need
help [chuckles], but it's like,

379
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:19,446
"How do I get

380
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,986
people -- how do I onboard them?
What do- what do I really need

381
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,106
here?" And so, like, pausing to
take the time to think through

382
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,866
what do I need, what are the
processes that need to be

383
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:31,447
updated, those are the things
that are going to help you to

384
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:35,376
scale down the road because it's
set up. I can bring in a new,

385
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:40,162
like, four new note takers this
morning. I added to our

386
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,842
organization and set them up
with the documentation that they

387
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,522
need,

388
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:47,331
and walk through the processes.
And I've -- we've got a couple

389
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,662
more volunteers that I reached
out to as well, but all

390
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,297
of that needed to be set up in
advance. So when somebody says,

391
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,932
"I

392
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:57,621
would like to help, where can I
help?" there's a place to send

393
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:58,101
them to.

394
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,839
Dan: Yeah. And like -- oh, I was
just gonna say, at the --

395
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,029
having-

396
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,552
having more people helps do
things, like we've- we've talked

397
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:06,075
about adding

398
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,345
a day for coffees, right? But we
can't -- you know, up until now,

399
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,259
we've- we've only had our
maintainers being -- kind of

400
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,884
controlling

401
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,624
those -- that -- dealing MC
first for these events. And

402
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,364
while we're-

403
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:20,055
we're just sort of expect it in
-- as it is. So, adding-

404
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,045
adding them — see, like, Suze —
is a big step for us. And, you

405
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,994
know, we don't wanna just do it
willy-nilly. So, like -- just

406
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,943
like

407
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,525
Bekah was saying this, having
all that stuff written down and

408
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,404
having clear paths for people,
it's turned out very

409
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:33,795
important [chuckles].

410
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,454
Bekah: Yeah. And we sent out a
community survey or- or we had

411
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,089
the

412
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,460
community survey that we were
posting in Slack and during our

413
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,299
Virtual Coffee meetings for a
couple of weeks to get feedback

414
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,234
from the community. And so,
we're also taking like, what-

415
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,169
what does

416
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,349
the community value? So, we know
that there are- are things that

417
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:55,619
everybody values, but like
really getting that down, having

418
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,439
conversations, having
maintainers Q&As allows us to

419
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,259
get

420
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,854
feedback and really think
through what we're- we're doing.

421
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:06,449
Kirk,

422
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,910
do you wanna talk a little bit
about the results of those

423
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,690
surveys? Some of the key
takeaways that we had?

424
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:13,845
Kirk: Yeah. Well, in the sort of
like overarching ourselves that

425
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,105
we

426
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:20,355
had, first of all, generally
positive responses, which is

427
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:24,555
nice. I don't know. It's just
nice to not be told, like, "You

428
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:27,899
suck [laughs]," in another time
[??]. So, mostly positive. A lot

429
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,243
of it was like existing

430
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,729
systems that people want, maybe
like a little bit more, you

431
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,214
know?

432
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:37,964
And I think a lot of it was
maybe just like a little more

433
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:40,307
like fidelity and we've talked
about this. Like, "If I wanna

434
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,650
volunteer,

435
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,449
how do I do that?" So, there are
a lot of people who weren't like

436
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,069
--

437
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:47,434
or they're new, or they're still
sort of getting into things

438
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:48,799
like,

439
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,374
"How do I do more?" And making
that really, really transparent

440
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:51,949
with

441
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,364
people, with something that
seemed to resonate. Right now,

442
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,778
we have a

443
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,329
few sort of like key events that
happen in the community. We have

444
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,085
our Lunch & Learns, we have the
Lightning Talks, but we also

445
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:08,404
have -- I guess this concept
that wouldn't be about -- like,

446
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:09,723
this

447
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:11,944
Coffee Table groups, which are
really just things started by

448
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:14,133
the

449
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:18,214
members where they saw like a
need or a space for something

450
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,275
they were interested in and they
just self-organized. And that's

451
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:25,595
super great. And we, like, we
like those things, so there's a

452
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:28,159
question. Okay. How do we
support people who wanna do

453
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,723
this?

454
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:36,079
How do we, again, like, avoid
some of the pitfalls or some of

455
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,609
the dangers of like doing a lot
of volunteer work, right? So

456
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,139
it's

457
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,224
like, if you wanna do this
group, what can we help you

458
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:43,308
with?

459
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,039
Like, what support can we give
you? What support do you need?

460
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,294
Can we equip you to kind of
like, have an idea of like how

461
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,019
much

462
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,609
effort it's gonna take, if you
need to stop — I think it is

463
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,169
like

464
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,352
most important that — if you
need to stop performing a role,

465
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:58,534
can you

466
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,055
do that -- communicate that in a
way that, like, is safe for you,

467
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,379
comfortable for you, like,
minimal pain points. So there's

468
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,703
been

469
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,535
a lot of things like that, you
know? Basically just people

470
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:09,484
saying like, "This stuff is
going on here. I really like it.

471
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:11,433
How

472
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:12,784
can I get more involved?" And
then us figuring out a way to,

473
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:14,134
like,

474
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:19,154
take people's enthusiasm and
then like put them on a path to

475
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:21,404
success for what they're gonna
do, which I think is super

476
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,402
important, you know? Like a lot
of ... I don't know. When I

477
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,400
think of like what it

478
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,619
comes down to with like these
types of initiatives, it's ...

479
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,838
you

480
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,670
find two issues. Sometimes
someone has a great idea, but a

481
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,910
system's not set up for it so
they can execute it and they get

482
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,920
bummed out. Or they have an idea
and they sort of like go

483
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,930
headlong

484
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,640
into it and, you know, kind of
like burn through their life

485
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,307
force like a Phoenix. And
neither of those is great. So, a

486
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:53,974
nice

487
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:59,884
middle ground and it, you know,
I think this idea of sustainable

488
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:04,565
leadership, I think is something
is really important to us. If

489
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,384
you wanna lead something, we
wanna help you do it, but in a

490
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:12,515
way where you can keep doing it
on your own terms and not feel

491
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,749
like you have to because of
other people, or you have to

492
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,983
because

493
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,807
it's like, you know, just ... I
wanna do this while it provides

494
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,630
value and

495
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,079
joy for me, and then when I'm
ready to stop, you can stop. And

496
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,269
that's okay. And I think that's
the thing we've- we've kind of

497
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,459
gone over

498
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,490
this community. We like the fact
this is not a space where

499
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,750
you have to come in perfect, you
know? We like the fact that

500
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,757
people can grow here, there was
this little space to grow here,

501
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:44,764
there's a

502
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,345
space to make mistakes within
reason, there's a space to

503
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:51,785
practice things that you're not
perfect at, you know? A lot of

504
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:52,810
times people hesitate, I mean
even things like, why don't you

505
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,835
learn --

506
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,024
just like, "I've never," you
know, "I've never done speaking

507
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,193
before,"

508
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,295
but like, if you haven't, this
is probably the best space to

509
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:00,275
give

510
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,584
it a try. It's a non-hostile
audience who only is interested

511
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,893
in

512
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:11,359
just like supporting you as much
as possible, you know? So,

513
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,744
yeah. It- it -- the -- well, I
was really validated by a lot of

514
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:16,129
the

515
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,549
survey responses kind of echo
what we were feeling as

516
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,259
maintainers and everyone seems
to kind of be on board, like

517
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,069
making this even more awesome.

518
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,690
Bekah: Yeah. Dan, do you wanna
talk through the things that you

519
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,240
implemented to help support our
Coffee Table groups?

520
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:35,374
Dan: Yeah. I mean, we -- the --
I think the- the biggest thing

521
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:36,993
-- the first

522
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:38,659
thing is just the -- is just
that the form and the stuff that

523
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,324
we've

524
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,295
been talking about a little bit
i-i-is making it available. Just

525
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,625
letting our members know that
it's- it's a thing that they

526
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,125
could do, you know? And then
after that, I've just kind of

527
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,454
scratched the surface about
supporting these groups on a

528
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,194
technical level. But -- you
know. So, one of the things was-

529
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:03,365
was setting up a calendar system
so that I, you know, people

530
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,360
can log in -- our- our members
-- I mean, our -- the- the group

531
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,355
leaders can

532
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:11,375
log in and add their events, you
know, recurring events or one

533
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,962
off events. And then those
events get filter back out

534
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,549
through

535
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,349
our website and, you know, onto
our events' page. And they also

536
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,149
-- I added

537
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,940
a Slack bot sort of thing that,
well, we'll- we'll send

538
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,730
reminders from

539
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,630
that. So we moved on from
Meeting Place and are using

540
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,905
that for our events now too, and
not just the special interest

541
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:32,180
group

542
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,055
stuff -- Coffee Table groups
[chuckles]. Sorry. We call them

543
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,930
the special

544
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,359
interest groups for a long time.
But -- so- so- so, yeah. So

545
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,144
that was like, this is like kind
of step one, is- is allowing

546
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:51,275
our group leaders to sort of
roll their own stuff, you know?

547
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,005
So they don't have to ask us to
add things to the calendar, ask

548
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:57,365
us to add things to Slack -- in
Slack, you know, Slack

549
00:23:57,424 --> 00:24:03,664
reminders, and things like that.
And- and with -- along with

550
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:05,944
that, sort of copied the
co-working room experience and

551
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,224
[chuckles]

552
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,879
made it -- so that we could --
so our group leaders could use

553
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,143
our

554
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:16,654
Zoom for events, which was
another sticking point because

555
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,095
if you don't have a paid Zoom
account, then I think you were

556
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,285
still limited to 40 minutes or
something like that. You know,

557
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,815
there's limitations for- for
free accounts. And so, having a

558
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,345
central

559
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:30,154
place that you can trust that we
will have things to get taken

560
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:31,219
care of and have some moderation
tools in place, things like

561
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,284
that.

562
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:37,625
So- so, yeah. And then I think I
have, you know, next is gonna

563
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:43,549
be some things more for general
users to log in and be able to

564
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,940
maybe RSVP for events or add
things to calendars, things like

565
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,445
that. So, that's coming down the
line. But- but, yeah. That's --

566
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:51,950
all

567
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,950
the- the- the group membership
stuff is in place right now. So

568
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,240
it's kind of- kind of exciting.

569
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:58,594
Bekah: Yeah, I think it's been
great. And I'd like -- I would

570
00:24:58,594 --> 00:25:00,153
just wanna

571
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:04,265
share what some of our Coffee
Table groups are, just so if you

572
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:08,914
are listening, you have an idea.
We've got -- at -- well, every

573
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:10,586
Monday, in Slack, in our
announcements channel, it drops

574
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:12,258
all of the

575
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,289
things that are happening this
week. So it gives an overview.

576
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:19,549
We've got tech interview study
group where they go through job

577
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,334
preparation materials, give each
other feedback, answer

578
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:23,089
questions,

579
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,069
and things like that. Meg — who
you heard from this season — is

580
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,539
running the accountability
buddies sessions, where it's,

581
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:37,430
again, I think job focused or-
or working on projects, that

582
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,605
kind of thing. We have the React
group as well. We have ... let's

583
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:48,585
see. Indie hackers, and we've
got a new one, which is like a

584
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,370
Virtual Coffee speaking group
where -- actually Kirk, you and

585
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,125
I

586
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,434
are up first, next week. Is that
next week, or the week after?

587
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,743
Well,

588
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:59,234
we're giving short speeches. So
we should prepare for those,

589
00:25:59,234 --> 00:25:59,474
right?

590
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,320
Kirk: We should really find out.
If it's [chuckles] next week or

591
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,710
few weeks.

592
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,000
Bekah: It's in the calendar for
sure.

593
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Kirk: There you go.

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,434
Bekah: So [chuckles] I should
write something. I know I'm

595
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,868
missing some of the other groups
that we

596
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,519
have going on there, but those
are the ones that- that I can

597
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,169
see

598
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,605
right now, and are coming to ...
my thoughts. So, I don't

599
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:23,134
know, just like a lot of really
fun stuff in the- the VC's

600
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:24,663
speaking

601
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:30,365
group — the Virtual Coffee,
we've refer it as VC — is a cool

602
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:34,595
one that's just started meeting
this past week? I don't know.

603
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,190
The last couple of weeks. So it
all kind of blend together. So

604
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,775
[chuckles], we- we

605
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:39,545
met fairly recently for the
first time, and kind of plan

606
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:41,315
things out,

607
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:44,105
and things are growing from
there. So, there's always

608
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:48,095
something that there's a need
that can be filled or there's an

609
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:49,842
interest like, honestly, I- I
was thinking about like, "Okay,

610
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,589
what

611
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,310
Coffee Table groups would I like
to see?" And I don't know if

612
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,880
this

613
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,859
fits into a Coffee Table group,
but, like, I don't know

614
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:06,785
what to call it. Happy Hour-
Happy Hour Special Interest

615
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:10,055
group? I -- it kind of like
falls outside of there, but like

616
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:12,379
something low-key, let's get
together, and hang out. We've

617
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,643
done

618
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:17,569
some happy hours or social hours
before. And- and just like

619
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,494
seeing

620
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:24,244
the community interact in those
ways has been a lot of fun. But

621
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:25,909
are there other groups that you
two would like to see at Virtual

622
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:27,574
Coffee?

623
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:31,984
Kirk: It's -- see, this is ... I
don't know if it's different

624
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,994
from the

625
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,335
happy hour group, but we've been
talking about VC

626
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:39,394
karaoke for like, forever. And
I'm- I'm so down. So down with

627
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:42,453
the karaoke.

628
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:48,305
There's a -- okay. So this is
one that came up just yesterday

629
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:52,729
actually. I was talking -- who
was I talking to? People [Bekah

630
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:57,153
chuckles]. And we were

631
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:59,652
talking about ... oh, yeah-
yeah. We were talking about

632
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:02,150
poetry. And we were like,

633
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,499
where -- if you were gonna share
your poetry and music, like,

634
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:04,818
where do

635
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:09,769
you put -- content creation is
slightly different. It's not

636
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,794
necessarily content, right?
Like, it's just like -- it's

637
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:13,819
like art, that for

638
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,119
me -- that I'm sharing with,
like, friends. So then it's

639
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,419
like, "Hmm. Maybe

640
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,295
that goes into --" I think we
have a -- so -- do we have a

641
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:24,170
channel about crafts? Is it
craft --

642
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,769
Bekah: Making stuffs.

643
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,849
Kirk: Yeah. I'm not in it cuz I
thought it was about macaroni,

644
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,077
but it's not [Bekah chuckles]. I
get this idea. So yeah. It was

645
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:37,184
-- maybe there- maybe there's
like another space

646
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,974
for that, but, you know, that's
-- those- those are the two that

647
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:42,434
immediately came to mind. But I
feel like there's a ton more

648
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:45,685
like ... I don't know. I- I
think since the [chuckles] --

649
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,845
since we get -- we got past

650
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:51,725
the- the time of Bryan
[chuckles] making channels

651
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:54,605
[laughs], we've been a lot more

652
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,065
judicious about them. We made a
channel for making channels,

653
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,264
which I actually think has
worked out pretty well, as like

654
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:01,433
giving

655
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:03,339
people like a clear space to
discuss wanting certain

656
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,244
channels.

657
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:10,134
The -- yeah. What I like about
the special interest groups is

658
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:12,204
like, it -- we don't predict
them, right? The members --

659
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:14,274
someone has

660
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:18,654
an idea, they will typically
like find some way to poll the

661
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:20,814
community, you know? Get
feedback, and like, general

662
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,974
random, if

663
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,756
there's enough interest and
people like hype enough, they

664
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,538
give it a try.

665
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,539
And then, like, we, as the
maintainers, only come in like,

666
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,414
"Hey, you're doing an awesome
thing," you know, "Let's see if

667
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:33,259
we

668
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:37,534
can, like, help out with it."
Yeah. I mean, having a process

669
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:41,809
to that is good [??], too.

670
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,420
Dan: Yeah. I mean I -- What was
that? What did you say?

671
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,599
Kirk: I mean, having a process
for that is good. It's like some

672
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,189
things

673
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,869
end up not being like -- they
just -- it's like, okay. Like,

674
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,548
if we have

675
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,079
external events, right? Which is
where people can basically, you

676
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,670
know, if they have a thing
that's going on outside of the

677
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,430
community, you can always like
put it in there. A lot

678
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,305
of stuff ends up like, well,
this is probably just an

679
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:05,180
external.

680
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,480
Coffee Tables, or, spec- now I'm
saying special interest groups.

681
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,019
Dan, what have you [chuckles] --

682
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,660
Dan: Well, we call them that for
like a year. And then we figured

683
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,119
out Coffee Table groups, which I
like. It's just- it's just the

684
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,349
other one is stuck in my head.
So --

685
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,664
Kirk: Yeah. The- the- the key
thing is that it's- it's a by

686
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:23,118
members for members. I

687
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,429
think that's like the- the --
sort of the core concept, you

688
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,739
know? So,

689
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,745
it's not like an outside person
coming in all that it's just

690
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,750
like

691
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,200
a seminar hold by our member
[??]. So if you're gonna

692
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,029
maybe expand it to everyone,
then it sort of, you know, the

693
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,858
ability

694
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,230
to like make sure it stays like
VC oriented will be diminished,

695
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,612
right? Like, sticking to the
CoC, there's like all these

696
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,994
other

697
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,095
things you just can't control if
it's not. So -- you know.

698
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,774
Bekah: We- we have talked about
some cross community

699
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,618
collaboration.

700
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,945
And I know that there has been
some talk among our members,

701
00:30:57,945 --> 00:30:59,970
like

702
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:03,014
what if this small interest --
oh my, I did it now! [Deep

703
00:31:03,014 --> 00:31:05,999
exhales] Dan. Why you of all
people --

704
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Dan: What have I done? [Laughs]

705
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,036
Bekah: [Chuckles] What if our
Coffee Table groups collaborated

706
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,953
with

707
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:18,154
somebody else? Like, you know,
had another -- a community, a

708
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:21,934
meetup, like, maybe freeCodeCamp
Philly. Meg was talking about

709
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:25,234
join accountability buddies. And
so there's definitely something

710
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:26,719
that we're considering. And it
-- you know, it goes back to

711
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,204
like, what

712
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:31,775
are the needs of our members and
the leaders of those groups. So,

713
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,400
you know, it- it -- always
talking things through and

714
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,755
figuring out like, is

715
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:41,855
this a good fit for our
community? Is the priority of

716
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:42,634
everything that we're doing?

717
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:47,930
Kirk: Yeah. We, you know, like
acknowledging that we can't be

718
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:55,910
everything for all people. And
also, like, we can't — ourselves

719
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,634
necessarily — like, handle like
every -- like there's lots of

720
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:59,358
good things

721
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,660
that members might want or like,
but we're just not equipped to

722
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,594
provide those things. So if
there's like a great partnership

723
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:06,528
with somebody

724
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,279
else who is doing that, then
that's awesome. Brian Rinaldi

725
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,910
comes to mind with like cfe.dev,
you know? Like,

726
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,799
consistent guest speakers, great
quality talks, like, that's

727
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,940
something to takes a whole team
to organize and through all that

728
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,590
consistent basis. We, you and I,
have the bandwidth for that if

729
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,240
he

730
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,725
does. And so, like, letting
members like, "Hey, every two

731
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:29,210
weeks,

732
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,160
you're getting like a high
quality thing that you can just

733
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,807
check out," feels good. Like,
everyone seems -- both sides are

734
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:36,335
sort of like

735
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:39,305
getting something out of it. So,
if there's ways to do more of

736
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:44,525
that, it's great. Yeah. But
those do always require like

737
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:46,654
extended -- you just have to
like work them out more because

738
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,723
now,

739
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,599
you have to like check in that
this other group are aligned

740
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,474
with

741
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,214
you, you gotta figure out
timing, you gotta -- you have

742
00:32:54,214 --> 00:32:55,954
your own

743
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,094
cadence of work, they have their
own cadence work, it becomes

744
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,234
this

745
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:00,987
thing, you know, but -- or not.
I don't think we're opposed to

746
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:03,740
like

747
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,390
anything that doesn't bring
value for them in.

748
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:15,500
Bekah: Yes, 100%. So, you know,
as we're working through

749
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,799
all of this stuff, there's
obviously still pain points that

750
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,650
we need to solve. So I thought
maybe we could talk a little bit

751
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,030
about, you know, some of the
things that we're still trying

752
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,410
to

753
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,319
work through and- and maybe some
of the ideas that we have or

754
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:35,059
just thoughts that we are trying
to work through.

755
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:39,157
Dan: Yeah. So I [clear-throat],
excuse me, I think one of our

756
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:40,969
based -- I mean, we've

757
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,799
talked about some of the
struggles and, you know, some of

758
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,009
them when we were talking about
why we pause memberships

759
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,539
wh-with regards to having
leadership support and things

760
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,650
like that. But a-another side of
that was -- is just handling

761
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,579
incoming members, right? So I- I
think probably a lot of people

762
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,890
have had the experience of
joining some community at this

763
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,035
quarter, Slack, or whatever, and
being just overwhelmed

764
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:05,180
[chuckles], or

765
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,949
not having any idea what to do,
or- or maybe it's a little

766
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,824
clear, but it's still just a
huge community with a million

767
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:13,699
channels

768
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,102
a-a-and no, you know, personal
connection for you. And so, you

769
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:21,815
put your

770
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:23,045
name in [chuckles], you know,
you fill out the intro thing and

771
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,275
say, "Hello

772
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,255
everybody," and, you know, some
people react and say hi and

773
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:28,279
stuff, and then- and then it's
kinda ... right [chuckles]? I

774
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,303
wouldn't want

775
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,429
that to be -- I mean, if peep-
if that's what happens in

776
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,554
Virtual Coffee,

777
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,065
that, you know, so be it for-
for a person, but in general, we

778
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,815
don't want that to be that case,
right? And so our -- and this is

779
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:43,715
why we've stuck pretty hard with
our- our -- how you join Virtual

780
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,175
Coffee is by coming to one of
our coffees, right? First.

781
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:48,635
Before any

782
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:51,154
Slack invites happen, things
like that. [Clear-throat] One of

783
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,464
the difficulties

784
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:56,959
with that is- is -- it was a
very manual process, right? The

785
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,453
--

786
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,314
you know, Zoom has its own
authentication stuff, and

787
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:04,143
there's

788
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,972
no way to have people signed
into like a Zoom account, all of

789
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,800
the

790
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,360
same account. Otherwise -- I
mean, it -- or- or unless they

791
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,920
were paid members,

792
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,745
right? So if you are on a work
Zoom or something, you know,

793
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,570
that- that

794
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,749
your work is paying for every
single seat [chuckles]. And so,

795
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,919
that's

796
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,509
obviously not a- a solution for
us. So when you join a Virtual

797
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,098
Coffee's

798
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,599
Zoom, you're just joining on
your own account, and you can

799
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,099
fill out

800
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,670
whatever details you want.
There's no way for us to manage

801
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,269
any of that. What that means is
there's no auto- there's -- it's

802
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:34,894
very complicated, and possibly
sometimes impossible to connect

803
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:37,519
a

804
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,639
Zoom account with a person, you
know? And whether they've joined

805
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,610
or not before, and things like
that. And so, our solution was

806
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,760
just to have people fill out the
membership form and, you know,

807
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,019
we'd have a little link after
coffees, and they would fill out

808
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,887
the form, and then we would
essentially go and make sure

809
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:54,755
that

810
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,674
they actually came, and then
send them a Slack invite, sort

811
00:35:56,674 --> 00:35:58,593
of all

812
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:01,144
manually. We -- wait, peep- just
-- maintainers were just doing

813
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:04,175
that. And that was hard too, you
know? I mean, that was time

814
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,324
consuming even when there was
just five people that, you know,

815
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:11,885
joined that week, it took up
time. And we have more and more

816
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:15,784
people coming, things like that.
And, so, that's one of the

817
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,224
challenges that I'd like to nail
down i-is just like what- what

818
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,664
it means

819
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:23,105
to be a member? How to- how to
join things, you know?

820
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:26,225
Those sorts of topics, right?
And then how can we- how can we

821
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,255
keep

822
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:33,454
the sort of intimate nature of-
of joining Virtual Coffee

823
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,184
while supporting multiple
members, you know, more and

824
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:40,324
more, large and larger group of
people. And then also how to

825
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:44,195
onboard them gracefully and
things like that, not overwhelm

826
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:48,739
people, and not call with them
with, you know, a million

827
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,404
channels and huge group of
people that they don't know

828
00:36:50,404 --> 00:36:52,069
anything

829
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,840
about. So, that's -- we --
we've- we've been talking a lot

830
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,610
about that

831
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,260
too over the past few months.

832
00:36:58,525 --> 00:36:59,799
Bekah: Yeah. And along with
that, when you have more people,

833
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,073
you're

834
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,494
gonna need more moderation,
right? So for us, moderation

835
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:10,105
hasn't been a huge issue, but as
you onboard more people and have

836
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:13,795
less of a personal relationship
with every single person that

837
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,837
comes in, it- it becomes a
little bit trickier, right? And

838
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:17,879
so you wanna

839
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,360
make sure that you're prepared
for something that might happen

840
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,739
and dealing with those types of
issues, and making sure that

841
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,650
everybody has access to that
information that they need. Not

842
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,914
everybody needs access to all of
the information. And so,

843
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:33,178
providing

844
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,769
each group of volunteers with
that information, making sure

845
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,769
that they're up to date and can
communicate openly with each

846
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:43,286
other when something needs to be
updated or changed is -- those

847
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:45,803
are

848
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,410
also, you know, priorities and
pain points that we're trying to

849
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,985
work

850
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,688
through. Kirk, do you have
anything to add?

851
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,778
Kirk: I think we should go back
to trial by combat for

852
00:37:55,778 --> 00:38:00,159
membership. Maybe we should go
back to the old ways. Now ...

853
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:03,818
no. I think, you guys, you hit
the nail on the head. I was just

854
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:12,623
thinking through things being
conscientious. You can only

855
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,853
get so far, just kind of like
going with the flow, and

856
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:18,083
eventually, like, if the flow
becomes like a delusion, you

857
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,313
kinda

858
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:24,744
need to have a plan. Yeah. And
it's- it's- it's just us sort of

859
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:26,663
being a lot more thoughtful
about stuff, and kind of

860
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:28,312
stepping back,

861
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:34,128
and saying, "Okay, if something
works now, why does it work? Is

862
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:36,393
there a way to like, clarify
that so we can reference why,

863
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:38,658
new

864
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,474
people can reference why," and
like, we start, you know,

865
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:42,289
building that up.

866
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:44,928
You know, we recently had like
something that make -- the

867
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,878
maintainers

868
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,719
were discussing and were like,
"Hey, is this in the Code of

869
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:50,913
Conduct?" And we were like,
"No," like, "We should probably,

870
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,098
like, put

871
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,704
it in there, right?" Just so
like we don't forget later if it

872
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,309
happens

873
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:58,278
again, there's like something
that we can reference and go,

874
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,115
"Well, we're not just making it
up on the fly as we go along."

875
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:01,892
Or, I

876
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:03,828
mean, we are, but like, the
things that we wanna keep

877
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:05,763
[chuckles], we're

878
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:08,909
putting it somewhere where it-
it can, you know, stay. Yeah, I

879
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:12,054
don't know.

880
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:17,043
And there's something about like
habits and traditions. If

881
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:22,324
something is good and provides
good value for you, you should

882
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:25,083
like find a way to keep it. And
if something is not providing

883
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,950
good value for you, then, like,
you should set it free. But you

884
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,817
-- it's

885
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:31,128
hard to do that if you're not
keeping track of those things.

886
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,000
So, yeah.

887
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Bekah: I think along --

888
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,824
Kirk: But [unintelligible]
thing, we can totally ... I'm

889
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:41,648
ready. Dan, are you ready? Dan
is [unintelligible].

890
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,353
Dan: I'm always ready.

891
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:48,000
Kirk: There you go. Bekah,
you're ready?

892
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:52,393
Bekah: Always. Always ready. I-
I think along with all this

893
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:55,724
too, when we're thinking about
these things, we also have to

894
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,988
think about them on a much
larger scale, right? So, if it

895
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:00,252
works now,

896
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:08,778
will it work if we have 500 more
people? And the biggest

897
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,524
value of Virtual Coffee, I
think, comes from the intimacy

898
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:13,054
those

899
00:40:13,054 --> 00:40:18,063
small group connections. And so,
I say 500 people and like, that

900
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:19,458
sounds scary to me. But, you
know, there's potential for

901
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,853
that.

902
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,088
There -- we would love to have
as many people as we can, if we

903
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,323
can

904
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:27,304
replicate that same intimacy.
And so trying to figure out how

905
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:29,284
do

906
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:33,603
you do that? If you add another
coffee chat, are- are 500 people

907
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:37,583
just going to suddenly appear in
Slack? I mean, they wouldn't

908
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,308
suddenly appear right there.
We'll be [chuckles] -- we're not

909
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:41,033
going to get

910
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:45,918
500 new people overnight. But
that's something that we have to

911
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:50,028
think about. I don't think it's
bad to have another pause

912
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:51,633
and membership in the future.
Now there are some communities

913
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,238
that

914
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:56,838
have opened membership as one-
one month during a quarter or

915
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,414
something. Or one week they
onboard new folks who are coming

916
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:05,193
into the community and otherwise
they're closed. So, there are a

917
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:08,974
lot of different ways that you
can build that into the process,

918
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:13,713
give everybody a break, kind of
like a vacation to pause,

919
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:17,643
breathe, think things through.
But, you know, ultimately we

920
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:22,023
have to be thinking about how do
we replicate — exactly what Kirk

921
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:23,683
was saying — is- is good about
this community as we scale as

922
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,343
well.

923
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:29,446
Kirk: Yeah. And there's
something that's been bouncing

924
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,278
around in my

925
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:33,993
head a lot about, like,
community size. And I have a

926
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,708
working

927
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:44,358
hypothesis, which is that I ...
don't think community size is

928
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:47,389
necessarily a problem. I feel
like it's almost like a

929
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:50,599
precursor, like, having the
community getting bigger can

930
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:53,809
lead

931
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,789
to other things. Like, those
things are actually the problem

932
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:57,880
or like a lack of certain
things. But if you know what it

933
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,942
is and you're

934
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:03,393
prepared for it, I don't think
it's like -- so, like, obviously

935
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,343
suddenly having 500 members
would probably be a bad thing,

936
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:07,083
you

937
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:11,673
know? But I guess if there was
an increase in 500 members over

938
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,103
the course of like 10 years,
like, I don't know. That's a

939
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,468
bad thing. So the problem might
not be the 500 members. It's

940
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:16,833
just

941
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:20,943
like, what is it mean when new
people enter the group, right?

942
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:29,164
And we found ... too many people
in at once, it starts to get a

943
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:29,884
little-

944
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,903
Bekah: Dilutes the experience or
something.

945
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:34,933
Kirk: -it gets a little -- yeah.
Well, it gets a little -- it's

946
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:36,522
like more strangers

947
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:40,063
in a room. And as much as
possible we try and like remove

948
00:42:40,063 --> 00:42:41,968
the feeling of like strangers in
a room, you know? Like, there --

949
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,873
it's like, this is

950
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:45,748
like
friend-I-don't-know-too-well-yet

951
00:42:45,748 --> 00:42:47,623
versus

952
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:50,198
like, person that I- I- I just
-- I don't want to interact

953
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:52,773
with. But

954
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,658
we also know like having fresh
new faces is just the way of --

955
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:56,543
like, it

956
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,634
just -- it keeps things fun, it
keeps things healthy.

957
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:04,833
Communities are dynamic systems.
People enter, people leave,

958
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:07,249
people return. And like, being
able to like handle all those

959
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:09,634
steps of

960
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:12,664
your journey as a community
member is really important for

961
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:14,734
like having a good community,
you know? So, yeah. Let's say we

962
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:16,804
have

963
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,574
like a thousand members, but
we're probably not gonna have

964
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:21,603
like a thousand people active at
the same time. They'll come in

965
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:25,594
waves, they'll come and go, and
it- it, you know, there's -- I

966
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:28,143
think there's a way of like
living in that space that can

967
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:30,183
feel really good. Like, very
quickly you figured out, "Oh,

968
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:32,223
it's

969
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:34,909
not so much." Zooms can have
lots of people. As long as when

970
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:37,594
people

971
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:39,229
finally start talking, they're
in like a small enough space

972
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:40,864
that it

973
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:43,923
feels comfortable. And that's
how the breakout room started.

974
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:47,463
So -- and I think there's like
similar techniques, so we can

975
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:52,204
grow, and not necessarily it's
like ... I don't know. This will

976
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:55,173
become like a thesis at some
point. But the key metric may

977
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:58,142
not

978
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:02,824
be total numbers, but sort of
like, how are the people

979
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:06,003
interacting with other people?
Are they still getting a chance

980
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:09,514
for, like, intimate moments with
a few members at any given time,

981
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:11,448
and we can make that work? And
we think we can make that work.

982
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,558
We

983
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:14,568
also think we can have like the
greatest conference of all time.

984
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:16,039
We have big thoughts.

985
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:17,000
Bekah: Next summer.

986
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Kirk: Am I right?

987
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,404
Bekah:  Well, I'm gonna push
back a little bit, Kirk. Cuz I

988
00:44:22,404 --> 00:44:26,808
disagree slightly with what
you're saying. I do

989
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,438
think the total number matters.
And I keep going back to -- it's

990
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:32,643
Dunbar's number, that you can
maintain 150 connections at

991
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:34,848
once.

992
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:38,274
And I think that- that allows
for Slack intimacy. So, I think

993
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:41,219
that

994
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:43,739
we also have to think through
two things here, right? We're

995
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:45,104
thinking about, like, what does
it look like, in the breakout

996
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:46,469
rooms,

997
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:49,889
in Tuesdays and Thursdays? We
like to keep it to eight to 10

998
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,786
people per room. And I think
that- that is- that is good. But

999
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:55,683
I also

1000
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:59,463
think that having that small
experience where you know

1001
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,158
people in Slack is important.
And it is tricky for the reasons

1002
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:02,853
that

1003
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:04,533
you say. Because people come in
and they come out all of the

1004
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,213
time,

1005
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:07,983
you know? Somebody has -- is
super active, and then they get

1006
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:09,423
a

1007
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:11,493
new job, and then you don't hear
from them as much, right? Or

1008
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:13,563
they

1009
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:15,783
can't participate anymore, which
is totally fine. So it's a --

1010
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:18,003
this like

1011
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:21,528
constant flow of people coming
in, so, you know, we might have

1012
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:24,047
--

1013
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,898
might say we have 500 people in
Slack, but we certainly don't

1014
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:31,579
have 500 active people in Slack.
But I do think that that idea of

1015
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:37,039
having 150 people says something
for the intimacy of the group.

1016
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,338
It's like their extended network
of people. You can go to an

1017
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,673
in-person conference and be
like, "Oh, I know that person

1018
00:45:41,673 --> 00:45:43,008
there from

1019
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:44,701
Virtual Coffee, so I'm going to
talk to them because I'm

1020
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,393
standing

1021
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:49,963
in this corner alone by myself."
Maybe that was me [chuckles].

1022
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:53,533
But I- I

1023
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:57,284
would like to figure out, or I,
you know, I think that we're

1024
00:45:57,284 --> 00:46:00,873
making progress towards figuring
out how to maintain that

1025
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,243
intimacy in both places. So I
think that maybe there is a

1026
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,583
world

1027
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,493
where we do have 500 people in
what- whatever platform we're

1028
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,403
on, but

1029
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:18,393
can still maintain that, like,
150 person asynchronous

1030
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:22,384
communication intimacy, as well
as those breakout room

1031
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:23,373
communications.

1032
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:26,263
Dan: Yeah, I- I- I agree. And I-
I think that [clear-throat] to

1033
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:28,048
like, kind of

1034
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:29,908
combine what both of you were
saying together, you know, it's

1035
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:31,768
the --

1036
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,418
like the large number isn't the
met- isn't the important metric,

1037
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,797
you

1038
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:35,863
know? And I think that's the
biggest, like, thing that I

1039
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:36,928
love,

1040
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,151
what- what was Kirk was saying
was like, if we- we- we

1041
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:41,373
aggressively

1042
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:43,548
don't have metrics [laughs], but
like, if we did, like, that —

1043
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:45,723
and it was

1044
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:47,079
possible — that would be the
thing to measure on, right? Is

1045
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,434
-- like, are

1046
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:50,764
our members making intimate
connections, you know? Are our

1047
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:57,753
members, like, part- part of a
group, you know- you know

1048
00:46:57,753 --> 00:47:00,634
what I mean? And so -- and I
totally agree with you, Bekah.

1049
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:02,448
Like, i-it's like, it- it --
when you say, oh, it -- the

1050
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,232
number, it doesn't

1051
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,083
matter, you know? It's -- you're
gonna -- like, the number does

1052
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,933
matter,

1053
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,288
right? And whether that 150
numbers is- is, you know, feels

1054
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,613
right

1055
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:18,184
or not is- is probably up in the
air. But like, it's- it's one of

1056
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:22,083
those things where it's -- and
this is why we pause membership.

1057
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,123
And this is why we're like
thinking so hard, is because we

1058
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:27,558
want to be able to keep the- to
keep the ... intimacy, and the

1059
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:30,993
--

1060
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:33,911
sort of shape of our [chuckles]
community while growing. And

1061
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,768
that's hard and not a

1062
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,889
lot of people have done it. And
we think we can crack it, and I

1063
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:44,088
think we're pretty close,
honestly. And -- but, yeah.

1064
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:48,018
It's- it's -- and it's very
important to us, I think. And

1065
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,898
I think it's important to our
community members as well. So

1066
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:55,369
I, you know, when you are on
out- outside of the community of

1067
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:57,034
Virtual Coffee, or maybe you're
brand new member, it might not

1068
00:47:57,034 --> 00:47:58,699
be

1069
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,726
as clear. Or maybe if you
haven't thought about it

1070
00:48:00,726 --> 00:48:02,753
[laughs], you know, and-

1071
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:06,963
and you just kind of along for
the ride. I know for- for my, at

1072
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:08,643
least personally, like,
sometimes I just don't -- I

1073
00:48:08,643 --> 00:48:10,323
don't think about

1074
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,929
why something feels great, or
like why something is, because I

1075
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,534
enjoy

1076
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:14,913
it, you know what I mean? And it
-- that's okay too [laughs].

1077
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:16,263
Like, it's

1078
00:48:16,264 --> 00:48:19,673
okay to just enjoy things. But
like, this is why we wanted to

1079
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:20,803
talk about this. This is- this
is the other side of the coin.

1080
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:21,933
And it's like [clear-throat]

1081
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:25,428
we use it so that we can help
support it. We are thinking very

1082
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:27,152
hard

1083
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:30,116
about why, you know? And- and-
and how we can do more. So,

1084
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,079
yeah. And it's-

1085
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,804
it's hard, but it's fun. It's
also fun and very gratifying

1086
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:36,259
too.

1087
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:36,528
So --

1088
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:37,994
Kirk: There are people --

1089
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:38,539
Dan: I'm excited.

1090
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:43,273
Kirk: Yeah. So I'm just gonna-
just gonna set the tone by

1091
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,934
saying a bunch of buzzwords
related to this scalability,

1092
00:48:47,443 --> 00:48:50,153
continuous integration,
[chuckles] continuous

1093
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:52,863
deployment. Because I

1094
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:54,229
can't help -- even as we're
talking about this, I'm like ...

1095
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,594
I dunno. Like,

1096
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:56,764
kind of feels like that other
stuff that I talk too much

1097
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:57,934
about.

1098
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:00,663
But nice. It's- it's sort of --
it's- it's the same -- it's-

1099
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:02,823
it's a

1100
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:07,893
similar concept of ... there is
a thing that you are a part of

1101
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:13,233
and you're working on, and, you
know, if- if that big core

1102
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:15,963
concept is there, and like the
people are there, and the energy

1103
00:49:15,963 --> 00:49:18,423
is there, it grows. And that's
good. But there are different

1104
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:20,883
problems

1105
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:23,134
at different sizes. And like,
part of keeping something going

1106
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,384
is

1107
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:30,483
knowing like, not just how to be
the like plucky up and coming

1108
00:49:30,483 --> 00:49:34,293
thing, but also how to be this
sort of like mature, ongoing

1109
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:37,893
thing. And we're- we're at that
point. Which is a good point

1110
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,023
to be, you know? I don't know
what the- the tech equivalent

1111
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:42,153
is.

1112
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:45,844
Series C ... I don't know the
words.

1113
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:49,443
Bekah: [Chuckles] That's right.
We're Series C community.

1114
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:52,469
Kirk: Sure. That sounds fine.

1115
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:53,784
Dan: Capital C.

1116
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Bekah: Yeah.

1117
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:56,599
Kirk: You can tell the nearest
--

1118
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:01,833
Dan: Or a capital C++ community
[laughs].

1119
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:03,599
Kirk: Oh, no.

1120
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Bekah: Not, Dan.

1121
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:07,923
Dan: I see if I can get Kirk to
yell at me about C++

1122
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:08,074
again [laughs].

1123
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:13,272
Kirk: I mean, I didn't yell at
you. You were just [Dan laughs]

1124
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:16,215
like -- you were like walked the
difference between C# and C++.

1125
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:19,158
And then I immediately thought
of

1126
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:22,413
like a thousand thoughts at a
time. I'm like, "Will you get it

1127
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:25,667
back, or watch it," you know?

1128
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:26,989
Dan: Oh, man.

1129
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:31,088
Bekah: Dan, you're derailing us.
We have done so well. We- we-

1130
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:31,088
Dan: I -- listen. I --

1131
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:33,548
Bekah: -recovered from the
initial intro question and then

1132
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:36,008
we were- were

1133
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:37,059
good. And then you were like-

1134
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:37,728
Dan: I- [chuckles] I have a --

1135
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,653
Bekah: -I'm going to break this
up before the end of the

1136
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:41,227
podcast.

1137
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,548
Dan: I have -- just -- there-
there is a- a set limit of the

1138
00:50:43,548 --> 00:50:44,957
amount of time that I can be

1139
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,358
serious for [laughs] the amount
of time straight. I'm sorry.

1140
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,758
I've -- I feel like I'm

1141
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:50,763
proud of us too. I feel like we
held it together for a long

1142
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:51,767
time.

1143
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,401
And we had some good- some good
thoughts and stuff. But then

1144
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:56,614
Kirk

1145
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:57,663
started yelling at me about C++
and it all just went up from

1146
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,712
there.

1147
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:00,333
Bekah: He didn't yell at you
during this podcast.

1148
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:01,773
Dan: Yeah, no, no. I had him do
it. Yeah. No, it's -- that's

1149
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:03,153
what -- that's exactly what

1150
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:04,923
happened. We're all --

1151
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:07,925
Kirk: [Unintelligible] you let
me do it. It is -- this was

1152
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:08,372
[laughs] ... one yo, you
[unintelligible].

1153
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:09,678
Bekah: Okay, listen. I think the
key takeaway from this podcast

1154
00:51:09,678 --> 00:51:10,983
is

1155
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:14,943
Dan is the instigator in every-
every one of these situations,

1156
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:18,423
okay. Go back and listen to all
the podcast episodes. It is Dan.

1157
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:18,753
Every time.

1158
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:19,963
Dan: Nope. There's always
somebody else there. And there

1159
00:51:19,963 --> 00:51:21,113
--

1160
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:21,454
the -- their- their fault.

1161
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:23,054
Bekah: Dan, it's- it's -- still
[chuckles].

1162
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:26,838
Dan: If I was just on my own, I
would get in no trouble.

1163
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:26,838
Bekah: Oh yeah.

1164
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:28,919
Dan: And that's not true
[laughs]. Oh- oh, also -- oh,

1165
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,000
no, this will be out --

1166
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Bekah: [Whispers] Couple weeks.

1167
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,734
Dan: This is gonna come out in a
couple of weeks. So we'll

1168
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:36,468
already have a couple, but Kirk

1169
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,748
and I are starting a new
streaming series called

1170
00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:41,000
TypeScript Tuesdays. And --

1171
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Kirk: I just want to --

1172
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,409
Dan: So, there'll be a couple of
-- so- so come find us on the

1173
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,818
Virtual Coffee's stream on
Twitch. It's VirtualCoffeeIO-

1174
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:48,204
Kirk: I just wanna --

1175
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:48,204
Bekah: VirtualCoffeeIO.

1176
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:51,829
Dan: -I think like that. But,
yeah. I imagine that Kirk is

1177
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:53,629
going to be yelling at me a lot,
there, too. So if you like

1178
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,429
hearing

1179
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,439
Kirk yell at me [laughs] — he's
holding his breath very

1180
00:51:57,439 --> 00:51:59,389
aggressively right

1181
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:02,208
now — so [Dan and Bekah laugh],
come join us on Twitch every

1182
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,027
Tuesday as well [laughs].

1183
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,423
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
something that we're working on

1184
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:11,748
too. Like, while membership is
closed, how do we provide ...

1185
00:52:11,748 --> 00:52:15,073
nope.

1186
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:17,173
My brain stopped. How do we
provide --

1187
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:18,573
Kirk: Finding other [??] spaces
where we get to interact with

1188
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:19,833
people outside of

1189
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:20,253
the community?

1190
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:23,000
Bekah: Yes. Value to the
external tech community.

1191
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Dan: Yes.

1192
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,403
Bekah: That was what I like to
go.

1193
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:28,000
Dan: Yes! Oh! And Bekah started
that Twitter ... that was-

1194
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Bekah: Chat. Yes!

1195
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,207
Dan: -tweet -- Twitter chat.
That's what we call it. Yeah.

1196
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:31,414
Yeah.

1197
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:32,659
Bekah: Yeah. So --

1198
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:32,914
Dan: How did that go?

1199
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:37,009
Bekah: It went pretty well. It
was fun. I have some ideas for

1200
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:42,259
some ways to update it. So,
basically I took the intro

1201
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:47,389
question and the backpocket
topic and put it out there for

1202
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:51,739
asynchronous Twitter chat last
week. I did it on ... I think, a

1203
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:56,239
Wednesday. So that was prior to
doing the Thursday coffee. And

1204
00:52:56,268 --> 00:53:00,559
I'd love to be able to combine
those two. So if we have related

1205
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,938
topics, then what might work in
the future is having an intro

1206
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:08,719
question for people to get to
know each other and including

1207
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,418
both of those conversations.
And, you know, both of our- our

1208
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:14,898
members who weren't able to
attend can engage in those and

1209
00:53:15,168 --> 00:53:16,728
the external community as well.
So, we'll try it out for a

1210
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:18,288
while,

1211
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:22,568
see how it goes. And hopefully
people will find value in it.

1212
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:25,534
Kirk: My topics will never be
related [chuckles].

1213
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,938
Bekah: [Chuckles] They -- Kirk.
We're going to meet on Monday

1214
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,168
and we're going to

1215
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:30,918
figure it out.

1216
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:33,721
Kirk: My topics only exist to
sow the seeds of chaos. And then

1217
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:36,343
I

1218
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:38,923
have to spend half a day feeling
--

1219
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,343
Bekah: Loki. You're Loki. I
think next time we do this, we

1220
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,728
should -- we --

1221
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:49,188
our intro question should be
like, what character -- what

1222
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:54,000
super villain would one of the
other co-host be.

1223
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Dan: Hm. I'll put --

1224
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,349
Bekah: So, like you, Dan, would
have to say Kirk's super villain

1225
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:01,698
character, Kirk --

1226
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:02,278
Kirk: So you're talking through
him. You just say --

1227
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:04,909
Dan: Okay. But we're saving-
we're saving this for next time.

1228
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:06,539
Kirk: Yeah, I'm like -- I'm
putting --

1229
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,719
Bekah: Or unless you- unless you
have it now.

1230
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:09,583
Kirk: Putting the thought in
your head now. [Unintelligible]

1231
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,288
Doctor Doom. He's evil.

1232
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,498
Dan: I don't- I don't- I don't
have to think about it. Yeah.

1233
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:14,207
Wait. Doctor- Doctor Doom? That
what you said?

1234
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:17,148
Kirk: Yes. Wait. What was that
tone? Whoa. Whoa-whoa-whoa.

1235
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:18,274
Dan: Oh, I thought you said
Doctor Who for a second. And I

1236
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:19,309
was a bit like,

1237
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:20,628
"Doctor Who? I don't think he's
a villain."

1238
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:21,369
Kirk: Ah [unintelligible].

1239
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:22,998
Dan: When you said Doctor Doom,
and then makes more sense.

1240
00:54:23,688 --> 00:54:25,618
Kirk: I can- I can upset an
entire fandom right now

1241
00:54:25,618 --> 00:54:27,548
[laughs].

1242
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:32,028
Dan: [Laughs] I mean, go for it.
I -- I'm not a Doctor Who -- I

1243
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:33,828
mean, I'm not a

1244
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:34,000
not-fan-

1245
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Kirk: You can call
[unintelligible] 'Whovians'.

1246
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,339
Dan: -but I'm not a fan either,
so you're not gonna make me

1247
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,678
upset.

1248
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,308
Bekah: I've only seen one
episode of "Doctor Who" and I

1249
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,732
think mannequins

1250
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:42,523
came alive or something. And I
was like, it was not for me.

1251
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,749
Kirk: They call themselves
'Whovians' and it sounds like

1252
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:46,759
children got abused [??].

1253
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:48,000
Bekah: You mean from "Whoville"?
With lil'-

1254
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Kirk: Exactly.

1255
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,500
Bekah: -little Cindy Lou Who?
[Crosstalk] Holding hands and

1256
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,000
sing?

1257
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Kirk: You sound like
rapa-pam-pam-pam.

1258
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,889
Dan: Cindy Lou Whovian.

1259
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:55,679
Kirk: What were we talking
about?

1260
00:54:57,518 --> 00:54:59,978
Bekah: What a great podcast this
is and we're glad that everybody

1261
00:54:59,978 --> 00:55:04,059

00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:05,884

1268
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:18,469
Dan: Yes. If you write a comment
that -- oh, I was gonna say

1269
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:24,000
something -- [laughs] I don't
want to prejudge the comments.

1270
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Kirk: Dan speak --

1271
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,219
Dan: I was gonna say, if you
write a comment that's

1272
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,438
interesting, we

1273
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:28,000
might read it on the podcast.

1274
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Bekah: Yes.

1275
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,336
Dan: But like, don't make that,
you know, don't let that stop

1276
00:55:32,336 --> 00:55:35,672
you from writing a comment that
is ... not

1277
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:36,063
interesting [laughs].

1278
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:38,000
Bekah: We find every comment
interesting.

1279
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Dan: Yes [laughs]!

1280
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,833
Bekah: So, write the comment.

1281
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,264
Dan: We would hear from
everybody. So, yeah. If you

1282

Tuesday when ar- arguing with

1295
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:28,219
you about tip- TypeScript
[chuckles].

1296
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,458
Kirk: With hushed tones. And
