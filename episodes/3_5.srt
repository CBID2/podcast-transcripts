00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:06,123
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode five of

2
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,803
the

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:10,214
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

4
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:12,624
that

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,196
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:17,485
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,774
their

8
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:21,536
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:22,976
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

10
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,416
share it with

11
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,565
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

12
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:31,882
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today we talk
with Kevin Truong. Kevin is a

13
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,421
senior software consultant at
Test Double and a coding career

14
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:40,072
coach at his company, Tap into
Tech. We had a really great time

15
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:42,771
talking with Kevin. He shared
with us his personal approach to

16
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,381
interviewing as well as some
really great methods and

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,072
approaches for people looking to
improve their interviewing game.

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,082
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

19
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,932
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

20
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:57,272
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

21
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:59,612
Today's

22
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,801
question is if you could hang
out with any cartoon character,

23
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,990
who

24
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:16,659
would you choose and why? So my
name is Bekah. I am a front end

25
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,159
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could choose any

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,264
cartoon character, I was never a
huge cartoon kid, but I loved

27
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:27,369
the

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,400
X-Men cartoon. And so I
professor X, like I always

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,430
wanted him to be

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,934
my mentor and teach me all of
the things because, you know,

31
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,438
I'm

32
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,980
pretty sure that I would fit
right in there with the X men.

33
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:48,834
Dan: Um, I'm Dan. I am from
Lakewood, Ohio. I do front of

34
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:52,015
development. Um, Yeah. I'm, I'm
kind of conflicted on

35
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:56,140
this.There's like...Professor X
is, you know, a mentor kind of

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,650
figure. You know, my, my first
instinct was Optimus Prime, you

37
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,120
know, for the same reason, but I
also feel like he might not be

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,630
that fun to hang out with. So if
the question is like hanging

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,140
out,

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,465
Then my answer is gonna be, you
know, you know what I mean? So,

41
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:13,645
uh, so like I think I'm going
more, um, I think I'm gonna go

42
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:16,884
with Raphael from Ninja Turtles,
uh, or maybe Michelangelo. I

43
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,014
dunno, same, same problem with
Michelangelo, but Raphael's a

44
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,694
little serious sometimes, but,
uh, well the problem is he's

45
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,694
grumpy, everybody our age
remembers the movies more than

46
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:28,754
the cartoon. The movies He's
really like a really kind of a

47
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:31,932
grumpy jerk, but in the
cartoons. Not like that. Uh, so

48
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:35,110
I feel like

49
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,110
the movies, you know, did him
wrong anyway, uh, ninja turtle.

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,500
So I feel like it would be fun
hanging. So it says

51
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,680
Bekah: out with the Animaniacs.

52
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,159
Dan: if I was the learn from
somebody it'd be Splinter, but

53
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,139
like, he wouldn't be that fun to
like, hang out with, you know

54
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,129
what I mean? So it's like,

55
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,080
Kevin: Get some looks like
walking around the street with

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,710
that. Yeah.

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,460
Dan: right, you got

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,960
Kevin: one of the characters,
but you know.

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,930
Dan: Plus yeah, if you can go a
transformer, then, then they can

60
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,699
like drive you around and stuff.
So that's cool too.

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,110
Kevin: Okay.

62
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,264
Dan: Um, I think Michelangelo is
my fate. My, my, uh, is going to

63
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,014
be my official answer.

64
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,810
Kevin: Nice. Well, hello
everyone. My name is Kevin

65
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,159
Truong. I am a software
consultant at Test Double. I'm

66
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,599
also a coding career coach at my
own business. Uh, Tap into Tech.

67
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:21,639
Um, he located in new Orleans.
Not sure if I said that. Um, Hm.

68
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,569
My first answer. And I already
told you earlier was I said

69
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,789
SpongeBob, like, cause I was
thinking about SpongeBob square

70
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,150
pants. Cause I grew up watching
that a little bit and I'm like,

71
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,310
this is a terrible idea. Hey, I
can't hang out under water. So

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,740
this would not be a good idea.
And then it's SpongeBob like

73
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,580
this, isn't a, this isn't a good
character to appear. And then a

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,047
little bit more thought I'm
going to go with, uh, Rick from

75
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:44,514
Rick

76
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:47,094
and Morty. I don't know if I
could keep up with that kind of

77
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,744
person or what kind of crazy
antics like, or I just feel

78
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,394
super

79
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:54,444
inadequate hanging out with him,
but I think it'd be fun. It'd be

80
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:59,034
a total 24 hours of craziness.
And, uh, yeah, I think it'd be a

81
00:03:59,034 --> 00:03:59,784
wild ride.

82
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,724
Bekah: Sounds like fun. I like
it. Well, thanks Kevin,

83
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,185
Kevin: answers is going to come
for all of us after this.

84
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:11,464
Bekah: Thanks for being here.
Um, we always love to start off

85
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,234
with

86
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,974
everyone's origin story, where
he came from, how you got to

87
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:16,713
this

88
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,535
point. So if you want to give us
your story, we'd love to know.

89
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:24,504
Kevin: Sure. Yeah, I've got it.
I've got somewhat of a journey.

90
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:29,334
So let's see. I'll start. Um, I
guess I'll start off as a kid,

91
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,075
maybe in middle school, um,
early high school, like I always

92
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,725
knew

93
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:36,115
what to do. Some sort of
engineering. Um, it was between

94
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:38,185
computer engineering, electrical
engineering. I remember like on

95
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,975
college board.com comparing
majors, like when a friend has

96
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,295
going to school and I was like,
I really don't want to do

97
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,615
coding.

98
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:49,675
So I'm really fascinated with
power. So I'll go with, um, with

99
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,849
electrical engineering. So I, I
kind of start off there. And

100
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,994
I've

101
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,964
always been fascinated with
power. Like just how power is

102
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,694
generated. I love solar energy,
wind energy, nuclear, and then,

103
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:02,875
and how it gets distributed to
homes. And

104
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:03,915
Bekah: Yeah.

105
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,745
Kevin: that was what fascinated
me. And, you know, with electric

106
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:09,459
engineering, there are some
programming classes. Now I've

107
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,279
taken a program class before and
I hated it. It was, it was in

108
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,750
Java. I would have failed the
class if my partner, Dustin, if

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,610
you're out there listening, like
thanks so much, like he saved

110
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,470
me,

111
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,245
but I still hated program. I
hated Java. Um, and. That was

112
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:28,495
kind of like my first name, like
this is not me. I do not wanna

113
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:31,435
learn how to program. This is
terrible. Um, but electro

114
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:32,905
engineering had some programming
classes to do some like

115
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,375
robotics,

116
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,875
a little bit of
microcontrollers. And it was

117
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,375
those kinds of

118
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,915
projects that for some reason,
like gave me my, my flow state.

119
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,670
Like I was staying up late hours
working, like I'm going to

120
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,365
figure

121
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:48,115
this out. Um, and that was kinda
what I got re-exposed to

122
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,444
programming a little bit. And
then you fast forward a little

123
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:54,970
bit to right out of school. Uh,
right out of college with my

124
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,610
electric engineer degree, I
worked in oil and gas actually.

125
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,574
Um, so I was working on the oil
rigs, like working in oil and

126
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:01,028
gas

127
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,574
industry, like flying out
helicopter rides two weeks on

128
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,119
two

129
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,550
weeks off, meaning you're out
there for two weeks coming back

130
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,509
in land for two weeks. Um, and
that was a summer programming

131
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,019
job, right? It was programming
we're we're programming valves,

132
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,105
right. Example, I can give, like
if a, the pressure in a tank is

133
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:23,035
rising too high, if statement
conditional right. Then shut off

134
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:26,574
a pump, right. That's or, you
know, if a fire is detected,

135
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:30,024
throw a bunch of Firewater onto
the, onto the platform kind of

136
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:34,464
thing. Um, so that was, that was
kind of another little

137
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,865
reintroduction to more
programming kind of side of

138
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:41,980
things. And. This is kind of
where web program kind of came

139
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,449
in. I was working there for two
years and I'm like watching all

140
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,529
these people like startups
happening, like people are

141
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,470
working from home. You, one of
those like crazy Instagram

142
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,019
pictures, like I'm just coding
here in my laptop on a hotel

143
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:57,069
pool. Like this could be your
life too. And I fell for that. I

144
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,740
was like, I want to do this.
Like, I'm seeing all these

145
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,920
billion dollar startup companies
making websites, web apps. And I

146
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,319
kind of, part of me always knew
I wanted to do something online.

147
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,610
Um, I, for some reason, just put
10 years, like I'm going to work

148
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,680
for 10 years and then I'll go do
my own business or something.

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,750
Um,

150
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,730
thankfully oil and gas, that job
kind of accelerated that. So I,

151
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,149
uh, I started teaching myself. I
was on the oil platform, like,

152
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,360
you know, you work for 12 hour
shifts and then you kinda go to

153
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,550
your bunk and kind of thing. I
remember like having my laptop

154
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,740
out, teaching myself, HTML, CSS,
get, um, and just kinda like

155
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:34,046
learning that in my spare time.
And I remember. Like, I call

156
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,323
this

157
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:40,345
the, I guess one of my top
dumbest best decisions I ever

158
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,054
made is I just quit. I didn't
have a plan. I didn't have like

159
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,763
a

160
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,404
software job lined up, but I was
like, I'll figure it out. And,

161
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,294
uh, I quit to kind of go into
training mode, which was

162
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,184
learning

163
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:53,605
how to code, uh, attended a
bootcamp. Um, and that's where

164
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:58,134
kind of web programming kind of
came out at. Um, and then in the

165
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:01,165
meantime, while I was looking
for software jobs, I was like

166
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,580
consulting, doing freelance
gigs. Um, making WordPress

167
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,785
sites, like,

168
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,374
you know, just kind of saying
yes to any opportunity. Good.

169
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,963
Which

170
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,019
kind of led to me learning
everything I know, like I, I

171
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,074
had,

172
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,244
uh, I think in one of our
previous episodes, you guys had

173
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,414
a

174
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,355
prompt saying, yes, I'm in drew.
Who said that? Right? Like you

175
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:19,645
just had a prompt saying yes.
And that was me. I was just

176
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:20,935
saying

177
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,765
yes to every opportunity I
could. I don't have a job. I'm

178
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,595
just

179
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,440
going to figure it out this. So
I learned WordPress. I learned

180
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,285
like

181
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,954
someone had a Squarespace, like
never did it, but I'll say I can

182
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,445
cause I'll figure it out. Um,
and so I was doing that in

183
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,845
between,

184
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,654
and then I started looking at
applying for software jobs and

185
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,594
getting better at doing that,
um, doing bootcamp instructor.

186
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:45,024
So I

187
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,004
ended up being a bootcamp
instructor for the bootcamp I

188
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,855
attended, uh, which led to other
roles at other different boot

189
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,175
camps. I got to see different
systems and different boot

190
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:52,495
camps.

191
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:56,904
Um, and you know, kind of seeing
other people go through the job

192
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,034
hunt process, as well as doing
it myself. So kind of a

193
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:01,134
long-winded

194
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,889
origin story, but fast forward
to now, um, I'm a senior

195
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,553
software

196
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:08,335
consultant at a great company,
um, using everything I learned,

197
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,315
but also the, all the skills and
experience I've learned. I've

198
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,670
managed to find a great company
of my own and applied for it.

199
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,995
And

200
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:16,485
history is history.

201
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,784
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
that. I think we both come from

202
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:25,134
different ish backgrounds, but
have similar ish journeys. And

203
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:28,495
so, you know, once I left, I
taught for 10 years, college

204
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:30,129
English, and, and once I left,
it was the same kind of thing.

205
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,763
You

206
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,674
know, I did the bootcamp, but
also I was taking jobs. I was

207
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,274
like, can you do a WordPress?
Yeah, I can do a WordPress site.

208
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,205
It was like one of

209
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:39,914
Kevin: the time.

210
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:43,524
Bekah: ever worked on. I did not
like WordPress at all. And then

211
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:45,355
eventually that project got
drawn out and then I was like,

212
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,855
well,

213
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,735
you know, that we're presses
outdated. So let's just do it in

214
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:53,034
Gatsby. And then like that got
outdated and I'm like, we can

215
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,629
move it to Jekyll. As I figure
out what I like doing and what

216
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,224
is

217
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:02,480
valuable to people, then I just
kind of follow that line. Also

218
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,085
saying, yes, I'm getting a
little bit better at saying no

219
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,690
to things

220
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,120
now, but, um, it's just a lot of
fun exploration of trying to

221
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,149
figure out, you know, what, what
you're going to do with all of

222
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,649
the new things that you've just
learned.

223
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,509
Kevin: And a lot of people I
coach, they always like say, oh,

224
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:20,574
I wasted so much time doing
that. And I don't want to call

225
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:21,639
those a

226
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,940
waste because now you know
exactly what you don't want to

227
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,870
do. And it's better to do that
very early on your career versus

228
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,809
wasting your time dropping
something to go chase this and

229
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,669
finding out that, oh, this was a
terrible idea. So now it's a,

230
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,529
you

231
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,939
always end up where you have to
be at, so it always has to

232
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,349
happen

233
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,679
the way it has.

234
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:43,420
Dan: So you are a consultant
with Test Double, right? And,

235
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,995
and so

236
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,825
Test Double is an agency that
does work for other clients,

237
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:49,095
right?

238
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,490
Kevin: Yes. That is correct.

239
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,204
Dan: with them, you're just
doing sort of client where

240
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:53,134
you're doing

241
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:57,514
development and stuff like that.
And then you correct. me if I'm

242
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,735
wrong, but you've founded, uh,
Tap into Tech.

243
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,429
Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Tap into Tech
is, is something that came

244
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,184
before

245
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,745
maybe early 2020, late 2019. It
was something I've always done.

246
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:12,705
That's why I don't really have a
hard date. So with my years as a

247
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,115
boot camp instructor, um, I've
always just had mentees, I'm

248
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,619
going to call it, but just
people in my circles that needed

249
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,104
jobs.

250
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,725
And it kind of just started off
with just emails, back and

251
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,345
forth,

252
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,175
random, um, communities and
slack and just messaging back

253
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,975
and forth

254
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:28,204
text messaging. So it's like,
Hey, I have this interview.

255
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,404
Like,

256
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,404
what should I do? Is this resume
look good? Um, and I've always

257
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,834
just had a fascination with
that. And the idea of tapping

258
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,264
the tech

259
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,094
came in, I was giving a tour at
a local company here in new

260
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,924
Orleans

261
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:43,106
with my current cohort at the,
at the time. And it was about

262
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,288
six,

263
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,649
seven different, um, people in
this cohort. And we went to go

264
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,590
tour this company that was a
software company. And they're

265
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,100
literally telling us like, yeah,
like just finding talent in new

266
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,590
Orleans is tough. Like there's
just not enough good people in

267
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,919
the city. And I'm like sitting,
looking at my class. I'm like,

268
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:04,429
you know, not everyone's a
hundred percent ready, but I bet

269
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,250
if you gave this person a shot,
this person would fly. I'd bet

270
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,279
with this other person with
maybe two months of actual more

271
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,370
production ready work. As I like
to call. They would be someone

272
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,269
who could fly, be coached and do
well at this company. Um, and

273
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,340
that's where it kind of sparked
where I realized that we're

274
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,919
bootcamps are missing it. Right.
They're teaching the technical

275
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,519
skills side of things, but what
does production ready look like

276
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,574
in the real world? Right? Like,
I don't want to bash on anyone,

277
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,538
but

278
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,580
you know, anyone can make a
weather app. If you followed a

279
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,639
turtle, anyone can consume a
weather API and throw it out

280
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,370
there. If they follow the tour,
what to do list those kinds of

281
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,644
apps are all very true. But what
does actual production look like

282
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:44,075
in boot? Bootcamps? I think fail
at teaching this, oh, let me say

283
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:48,485
that some bootcamps fail at
teaching that. So I've realized

284
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:52,085
that I wanted to fill in that
gap. I wanted to fill in what's

285
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,259
your 80% of the way there.
What's that last, very important

286
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,134
20%

287
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:58,654
look like. Um, so I started just
kind of curating, finding out

288
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,174
the

289
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:04,325
needs of certain people and kind
of inviting them to this group

290
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,014
of, Hey, let's do this together.
Let's work on this and let's get

291
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:08,705
you a tech job.

292
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,836
Dan: I think that's really cool.
I imagine you last times were

293
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,291
given very similar advice to
different people, you know,

294
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,746
based

295
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:18,711
on where they were in their
journey, you know? Um, and I

296
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,676
think that's great, like being
able to tie that into basically

297
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,641
a

298
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,162
service you can provide to, you
know, to lots of people.

299
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:28,841
Bekah: Well, you know, in Kevin,
you and I had talked, this was a

300
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,292
while ago, I think about some of
the major problems that we're

301
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,381
seeing with bootcamps or, or
students who are coming out of

302
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,562
boot camps. There's a lot of
promises that bootcamps give and

303
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,562
there's a lot of, um, you know,
people out there saying, oh,

304
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,196
there's so many jobs in tech,
just go to a bootcamp. Right.

305
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,830
And

306
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,981
yeah, like there's a lot of
senior dev jobs out there, but

307
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:52,361
they're the opportunities for
junior developer. There's there

308
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:56,261
are not that many and you really
have to be able to differentiate

309
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:59,892
yourself. So I guess maybe where
I want to start is what do you

310
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:05,351
see as the biggest problem or
challenge that people coming out

311
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:09,341
of bootcamps face, as they're
trying to find that first job

312
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,812
where there's a lot of
competition.

313
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,206
Kevin: Yeah, that's a good
question. I fight this every

314
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,600
day.

315
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:16,911
So, um, I work on eliminating
all of that with people every

316
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:19,191
single

317
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:24,116
day. So. Um, I think the problem
is let's say with, we'll start

318
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:28,317
with atypical, bootcamper kind
of thing. I call it production

319
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,527
ready, right? Like, let's say
it's a three-month course. You

320
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:34,826
walk out with three portfolio
pieces, but at that point it was

321
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:38,256
like our users. If you had a
thousand users on that pro that

322
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,086
portfolio piece, would it be
ready for that? I would wager

323
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:43,886
most of the time it's a no
right. That would wager that. Is

324
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,686
it

325
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,447
something that people could use
and get something valuable out

326
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:53,831
of? And I'll, I'll start with
this one concept. That's one of

327
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,322
my main concepts of what did I
try to teach is I call it,

328
00:14:56,322 --> 00:15:00,611
flipping the script, right?
Imagine the perfect job landed

329
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,162
right in front of you right now,
the hiring managers asking you,

330
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:07,241
would you be ready to take this?
Again, I'd wagers. Most people,

331
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,672
some people would be, most
people would probably lose that

332
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:13,241
opportunity because they weren't
just that production ready. They

333
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,581
made it not conveyed themselves.
Right. Maybe their online

334
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,126
presence didn't feel right. So
it didn't look experienced

335
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,671
enough

336
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:24,792
for this hiring manager to pick
them. Um, and so I, I start with

337
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,902
one just kind of filling in what
the ex that experience looks

338
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:34,062
like. In some ways it's starting
with a passion project. I know

339
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:37,871
that term gets used the way to
like a passion project, but then

340
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,292
really taking that project and
making it something valuable,

341
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:45,282
useful, where someone could say,
dang, a hiring manager saw this

342
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,861
on your, like, back to that
example, hiring manager just saw

343
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:48,881
you, Hey, I have this live
website up right now. You can

344
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:49,901
try

345
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,679
it out. We can walk through it
if you want. And that says,

346
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,456
damn, I

347
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,537
need to hire Bekah. I need to
hire Dan. Right? Like there's.

348
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,686
So, and that I I've merely, I
don't think that obstacle is

349
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:00,835
that

350
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,986
tall. Right? It's doable. It's
challenging, but it's doable

351
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:07,047
enough where someone says, well,
this is well thought out. It's

352
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,976
well-designed it shows that this
person can hook up a domain, can

353
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,791
deploy an app and can really
work with this technology. Let's

354
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,606
let's

355
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,297
say react, right? Like I need to
have this person on my team.

356
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:21,642
Right. Those are the kinds of
things that I try to get people

357
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,402
to aim for. Right? Like I need
you to be able to go in front of

358
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:28,361
someone, say, yes, I need to
have this person on my team. Um,

359
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,986
another one, you know, technical
side to skills is. Communication

360
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:34,961
skills. I feel like that's
something that definitely

361
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,936
doesn't

362
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,177
get touched on. Um, some boot
camps do good at it. Some most,

363
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:41,996
let me say this do not, they
don't even touch on it once they

364
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,571
get your 10 grand, they're just,
you know, here's your

365
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,146
certificate

366
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,216
out. You go, right? Like you did
your 200 commits then, which is

367
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,926
a

368
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:54,537
terrible metric, but some people
do it. Um, and in communication

369
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:59,261
is valuable because for early
career devs, Because you may not

370
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:01,782
have a hundred percent of the
technical skills, but by having

371
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:04,751
great communication skills,
someone that I know I could put

372
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,842
you on my team, my team will
like you, you have enough of the

373
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:11,142
technical skills that I know you
can fill in the gaps as you go.

374
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:13,466
Kind of thing I'd say is just as
important, if not, maybe

375
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,790
slightly

376
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,171
little bit more important than
the technical skills, right?

377
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,551
Like

378
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:22,112
coachability, I've heard this
from thousands of exaggerate,

379
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,746
hundreds of recruiters and
hiring managers. Right. That's

380
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,291
what they

381
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,021
say. They're really looking for.
Right. Don't need perfection. I

382
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:30,476
need to know that someone, I can
take someone and mold this

383
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:31,931
person

384
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:35,682
into someone that I can make an
all-star team member, but it all

385
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,512
starts with a union. Need to
know a little bit enough to code

386
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,342
and

387
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:42,521
problem-solve and be just being
able to communicate with your

388
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,991
team members on how to get
better.

389
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,372
Bekah: Yeah, I like that idea of
coachability. I think I've

390
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:49,676
probably heard that, but not
really thought about it very

391
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,980
much

392
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:53,186
until you were talking about it
just now. And I know for me and

393
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,391
a

394
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:58,066
lot of other. Developers who
came out of self paced

395
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,740
bootcamps, or

396
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:04,582
for developers learning on their
own coachability is a skill that

397
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,612
we don't talk enough about and
that we don't really practice.

398
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:11,092
Right. Because what you're doing
is you're learning independently

399
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,602
and that that's great. Right?
It's great that you can go out

400
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,076
there and find the resources
that you need to accomplish the,

401
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,550
the.

402
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:24,497
Thing. Right. But also you miss
out on a lot of that

403
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:28,547
communication. You miss out on
being able to learn from other

404
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:30,121
people and to ask questions
while someone's telling you

405
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,695
something.

406
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:33,916
So if they're breaking down an
issue for you and talking

407
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,136
through

408
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,146
it, then how do you know how to
ask questions? And I know for

409
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:40,156
me,

410
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:41,821
that was a real big challenge.
And sometimes it still is

411
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,486
because

412
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:48,311
there's. Um, you've developed
habits of staying in this world

413
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:50,396
of, oh, well, my job is to go
out and find the answers to

414
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,450
those

415
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:56,832
things myself, rather than like,
let's start by asking questions

416
00:18:56,832 --> 00:19:01,422
that can get us halfway up this
path rather than having to start

417
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,852
from zero and moving forward.
Does that make sense?

418
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,551
Kevin: Spot on. Right. And it's
exactly why I like communities

419
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:12,571
like Virtual Coffee or created
my own because doing it alone is

420
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,541
rarely the best decision. Right.
And this is personal experience

421
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:20,412
for me. Not to go too far, but
like I grew up in a household,

422
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:22,061
just do it yourself. Right.
Don't pay for that. Learn how to

423
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,710
do it,

424
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,691
save a thousand dollars and do
it yourself. Right. And then,

425
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:27,671
and I

426
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:29,081
always, I still do have this
mentality. Right. Like, it's

427
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,490
very

428
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:32,951
hard for me to ask for help I'm
breaking through with that. But,

429
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,186
um, especially when you work
solo for, I did consulting for

430
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,881
three,

431
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:40,511
four years, right? Like it's,
it's when you're alone, like you

432
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,876
got to learn a heck of a lot.
Right. Me trying to be cheap and

433
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,586
not pay for a $10 a month.
Server has taught me so much

434
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,296
about dev

435
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:48,747
ops. That's

436
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:49,366
Bekah: Okay.

437
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:53,436
Kevin: not enough, but you know,
just ways to save $5 a month in,

438
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:56,487
in managing my own servers. And
now, as, as I look back, I'm

439
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,436
like, that was really dumb. I
could have just saved a lot of

440
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:03,267
time, but, um, but the idea of,
of seeing surrounded by a

441
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,359
positive community and asking
for help. And having that

442
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,451
expertise

443
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:08,801
on hand of, Hey, this is what
the real world's going to look

444
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,151
like.

445
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,481
This is what you should prepare
for, or here's how collaboration

446
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,476
looks with, how do you, you
know, do PRS properly, right?

447
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:17,471
Like I

448
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:21,192
think you guys with the Virtual
Coffee, GitHub repo, right? Like

449
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,882
it's teaching people, oh, I
create this branch. I do this PR

450
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,719
it gets approved. Right. That's
a process that. I think only

451
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,556
half

452
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,987
the bootcamps I've interacted
actually sit down, they'll give

453
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,341
you a, year's a link to how to
do it. But as we all know as

454
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,695
coders,

455
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:39,537
right, it's, it's always, um,
doing it over, just consuming it

456
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:40,782
creation over consumption as I
call it. Right. You gotta do

457
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,027
this

458
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:43,556
stuff, not just read a blog post
and expect to be able to walk

459
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,085
out

460
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:47,967
and say that was worth a
graduation certificate kind of

461
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:48,237
thing.

462
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:52,032
Dan: I was, uh, to go back a
little bit to the, um,

463
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,892
production

464
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:55,856
ready part of It Right. I've
seen this a lot where people

465
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,820
have the

466
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:01,842
portfolio pieces. Right. And
they're just kind of linked on

467
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:04,332
their portfolio, but, um, you
know, maybe a couple of

468
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:07,811
paragraphs or whatever, but when
you, excuse me, when you are

469
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:10,872
helping people take their
portfolio piece to be production

470
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:13,301
ready, do you find that they're
missing like, that there's

471
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:18,642
actually like holes in the
project itself? Or is it, um,

472
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:21,071
more like the stuff around it,
the ops, you know, the, the

473
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,848
hosting stuff like that, that
you find that people. Maybe not,

474
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,625
not

475
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,186
going all the way to get to
production. Ready.

476
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,422
Kevin: is a little bit of both.
And I also add in yeah, that

477
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,887
there's holes, which is fine. I
think people need to get

478
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,352
overlap.

479
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:38,382
It's not going to be a thousand
percent perfect. You know, I, I

480
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,541
think some people fear like, oh,
if I make this open source,

481
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,416
they're going to see the
curtain, like get over it.

482
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,291
Right. Like

483
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:47,082
it's something as a talking
point, right. I love using

484
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:50,412
blemishes as a talking point of,
oh, actually let me point out my

485
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:52,076
blemish for you and tell you
how, if I had enough infinite

486
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,740
time, I

487
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:56,652
would fix it like this, but I
actually don't have enough time

488
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:00,912
because I'm working on my
freelance side. Right. There's

489
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:03,251
definitely some holes. I would
also add that it's just not

490
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:07,781
pushing the envelope enough,
right. Again, it's, I'm taking a

491
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,932
recipes app and I'm adding a
little thing like this, right.

492
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,552
Like, okay, well, how can we add
design into it? Right. Like

493
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:14,172
let's

494
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:17,531
add in tailwind and see how you
like using that. Let's add in

495
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:21,372
some, um, again, that wow factor
that someone lands on as like,

496
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:24,432
okay, this is polished, right.
They actually, and not everyone

497
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,022
has to, you don't have to be a
massive design. I teach people

498
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:27,612
or

499
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,251
I do it myself to just steal
designs, right? Like, I'll go on

500
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:33,582
a different website. Like, Hey,
that font pairing looks pretty

501
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:36,701
nice. I'm gonna use those exact
same font or this color scheme.

502
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:41,142
Like I'm just going to use that.
Um, and I think by removing some

503
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,592
of those analysis paralysis
barriers, right? Like, oh, like

504
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:46,031
design, I don't want you to
design, like, stop thinking

505
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,470
about

506
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:50,201
it. Just go use something that
works so that you can move on

507
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:54,432
kind of thing. Um, I think it's
a huge mindset barrier to hold

508
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:55,721
people back when, when they're
not, they don't feel like

509
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,010
they're

510
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:00,971
things. Perfect. Um, but I say
embrace it and use that as a

511
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,606
talking point of this is why
it's not perfect. You know, you

512
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:04,241
may

513
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:07,092
not notice it, but I'll show you
where I see my problems at.

514
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,971
Dan: Yeah, I like that. Yeah, me
too. I like that kind of

515
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:14,432
thinking. And you know, I've,
I've seen some people have like

516
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,372
blog posts where they explain
stuff like that, you know, about

517
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,622
their projects, about the, when
they're, you know, when they're

518
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,082
on their like learning journeys
and stuff. I always find that

519
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:27,332
really, really valuable. Um, you
know, as, as somebody who has,

520
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,132
you know, hired people or
whatever, you know what I mean?

521
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:37,001
It's, it's like the, that, that
idea of using, uh, don't know,

522
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,621
kind of, like you said, like
using, using a hole in

523
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:39,941
something,

524
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:42,582
but like being aware of it and
explaining why it's there or

525
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,352
whatever, what you would do if
you had the time, what you would

526
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:47,592
do, if you, you know, or what
you're going to do next, that

527
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,051
kind of thing. I think that's
great. That's a great idea.

528
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,132
Bekah: Yeah, it's nice to be
able to break things down into a

529
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:58,692
process. And to also, I mean,
that does a lot to show how you

530
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:02,412
think through things, how you're
able to talk about those things

531
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:03,971
and communicate those things.
And you know, that just goes

532
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:05,530
back to

533
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:09,311
your point. Like that's an
underdeveloped skill in a lot of

534
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:13,061
the developers that are coming
into, into the industry, right?

535
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:13,122
Yeah.

536
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:18,217
Kevin: yeah. And this a thousand
percent applies to technical

537
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:20,886
interviews, right? When, when
being stumbled upon something,

538
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:25,211
right. I went through the
experiment of applying for a

539
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:28,511
bunch of different jobs, because
I wanted to see if can I even do

540
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,461
this right? How can I teach you
what to get a job of? I don't

541
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:32,486
even know. I can't get a job.
Um, and I, and one of the things

542
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:34,511
that

543
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:37,092
I love kind of just showing,
bringing up to people was like

544
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:39,551
during technical questions where
it's something really simple,

545
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:41,861
Like I always tell people just
to laugh it off and be like,

546
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,435
look, I

547
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:45,371
have no idea. Like, oh, that's a
really good question. Um, I

548
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:47,306
don't

549
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:50,666
know the answer now, but let me
kind of just stumble my way

550
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,676
through and kind of just make it
very lighthearted and playful.

551
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:54,526
Like, um, you know, let's
pretend we're we're in this

552
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,376
techno

553
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:58,826
interview and they just ask
something about some ridiculous

554
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:01,227
searching, sorting out of their
guns. And then I was like, look,

555
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,116
I can sit here for 30 minutes
and not give you a good answer.

556
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,556
So

557
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:06,627
let me just talk to you about
how I would go through and do

558
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:07,767
what

559
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:12,027
you said back, like just. Teach
like, go explain your thought

560
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,632
process around it. Because
again, I would say that's also

561
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:15,237
probably

562
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:18,027
just as important, if not more
important than the actual

563
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:23,186
solution itself kind of thing.
And that's kind of the mindset I

564
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,737
always get to just like own
everything you do. Like don't

565
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:28,576
worry about all those little
things like that own it kind of.

566
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:32,392
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. And I
think one of the things that a

567
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:34,341
lot of technical interviews or
interviews in general don't

568
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,290
don't

569
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,386
take into account is that you
have the ability to ask. And

570
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:40,481
most

571
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:42,431
of your workplaces and you
should be asking questions,

572
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,381
right. And

573
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:45,941
so if you ask somebody, Hey,
just solve this thing that

574
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:47,500
you've

575
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,106
probably memorized because
you've been studying for this

576
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,711
technical

577
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:54,761
interview. Like what does that
even show? But to say like, I

578
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,366
think it is valid to say, okay,
well, this is kind of how I

579
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:57,971
would

580
00:25:57,971 --> 00:25:59,531
approach it. This is the
question that I have for you,

581
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:01,091
because I

582
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:05,201
feel like I might get stuck at
this point. So can you tell me

583
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,872
how you would communicate that
to me when I asked you this

584
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:12,136
question, you know, Pushback. I
mean, but also I will say that I

585
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,866
will not take a technical
interview for those reasons,

586
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:18,707
because I don't think that
they're valuable in most

587
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:25,366
circumstances. And I think that
they, um, leave out so many, um,

588
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,426
underrepresented minorities in
tech because of the type of

589
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:32,057
preparation that has to go into
them. And they don't account for

590
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,701
the privilege that you have to
have to be able to spend. All

591
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:38,592
this time. So this is me getting
on my soap box again, and

592
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:41,826
Kevin: Go for it. Come on, back
up, back.

593
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:46,241
Bekah: but I also think, you
know, there's, um, this is going

594
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:49,961
back to a point that you said
earlier about, I can't remember

595
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,196
exactly where it was coming
from, but talking about this

596
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,431
idea of

597
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:56,606
learning on your own and how
that's almost never the best,

598
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,780
um,

599
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:02,832
the best way to approach
learning, how to code for a lot

600
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,909
of people. That's the only way.
Unless you have community

601
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:06,986
though.

602
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,106
And so this is something I keep
going back to, and I keep

603
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:13,936
thinking a lot about how to
encourage this, but have

604
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:18,676
community collaborative with
them in some way, right? Like

605
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:22,817
participate in a study group or
talk to some people and say, I

606
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:25,666
would really like to be able to
build a project together with

607
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:29,582
you. And maybe it is a to-do
app. Right. There's a difference

608
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,912
between building a, to do app by
yourself and building a, to do

609
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,781
app with four people. So I've
kind of gotten in my mind that,

610
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:39,182
that there's this like nice
thing about groups of four. I'm

611
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:41,432
not

612
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,441
exactly sure why, but for me,
the approach is, you know,

613
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:45,450
finding

614
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:49,711
those four people and forming
your own cohort. And then you do

615
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,471
whether it's projects together
or you walk through curriculum

616
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:56,162
together, but in the end, you're
all collaborating and creating

617
00:27:56,162 --> 00:28:00,977
something. That you can show,
like I worked as a team on this

618
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:04,936
passion project and that's more
meaningful than working on

619
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,106
something on your own.

620
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,036
Kevin: Again, it ties to that
whole, again, collaboration

621
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:10,416
being

622
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:11,706
part of production ready. Right.
If you're going to be thrown

623
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:12,966
onto

624
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:17,017
this team, I need some do that.
You can work with this team. Um,

625
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:20,467
and it gives great opportunities
for during interviews, right?

626
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:25,696
Like the, all those, uh, kind of
cheesy scenarios. So tell me a

627
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,951
time when you blank, right? You
don't have to lie anymore.

628
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:30,206
Right?

629
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,406
Tell me about a time when you,
you guys had a dispute in your

630
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:36,287
team, right? Like you could have
those discussions, have some

631
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,826
ammunition ready to answer those
questions. Like, oh, let me tell

632
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,296
you about this group project
that I had, where, you know,

633
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:42,766
work with

634
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,431
this guy named Kevin, he had
this idea of this, what the

635
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,095
to-do list

636
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:50,116
should be like, but we sat down
and we talked it out. We, we use

637
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:53,326
some proper, you know, user
stories and we found out like,

638
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,237
Hey, maybe it's better to do it
this way. Instead of that way.

639
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:01,196
You know, that's, that's all
those experiences add up and

640
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,056
against your point, like,
you've, you've got to do this

641
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:04,196
with other

642
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:07,977
people. Like it's such a tough
journey already. At least we can

643
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:10,616
do it together and share our
losses and wins kind of thing.

644
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,831
And I'd like to ask it again.
I'd love checking in Virtual

645
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:13,046
Coffee,

646
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,836
slack. Like haven't been able to
participate too much, but every

647
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,374
night I open up and just see
like people share. This is what

648
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:18,912
the

649
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:21,311
new stuff I'm going to this
interview. This one didn't go so

650
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,192
well, but Hey, there's next time
everyone comes in times in,

651
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,826
right? Like it's nice knowing
that people have your back. And

652
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:27,460
I

653
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,101
think that's part important
facet of going through the early

654
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,741
career

655
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:33,882
job hunt kind of thing.

656
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:37,602
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. And I
don't even think it's limited to

657
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:41,021
early career too. Right? Like
we've had a lot of senior

658
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:44,142
developers in Virtual Coffee,
move on to new positions in the

659
00:29:44,142 --> 00:29:45,879
last couple of years. And
Virtual Coffee has played a role

660
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,616
in that,

661
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:49,761
you know, even talking about
salary negotiations or, you

662
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:51,906
know,

663
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:55,777
just cheering them on or saying
this was my experience in this

664
00:29:55,777 --> 00:30:00,636
position or this other person
that I, I know did this thing.

665
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,616
You might want to try it too.
And that's allowed them to just

666
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:04,596
kind

667
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,116
of take that information,
especially if they haven't been

668
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:10,596
applying for positions. And in
the last couple of years, if

669
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:14,846
you've been in the industry for
awhile, And you're interviewing

670
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,717
for the first time. And I don't
know, even five years, things

671
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,517
Kevin: Oh, the world's changed
Yeah.

672
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,497
Bekah: So I know that, you know,
one of the we're talking about

673
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:28,737
communication, right. And
communication can be hard for

674
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:32,307
people. So what are some of the
different approaches that you

675
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:36,596
take to kind of coaching people
on how to communicate and to

676
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:40,257
present themselves in a, in an
interview in a way that is, you

677
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:43,017
know, the person that you would
want to have back for a second

678
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:43,406
interview?

679
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:48,727
Kevin: Gotcha. Yeah. Good
question. Um, it's a journey.

680
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,767
myself have gone through it.
I've super shy. I still am

681
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,122
introverted

682
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:58,511
and that's not a problem. It's
just that I was always very shy,

683
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:04,061
always afraid to speak up. Kind
of always passive with the when

684
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:06,852
during like, not even just
interviews in real life. Right.

685
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,436
Does business and in
relationships and everything.

686
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,020
And

687
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,726
that's it. Wasn't fun. Let me
say it that way. Right. Life got

688
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:13,391
a

689
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:17,126
lot more fun. Once you're just
allowed to talk and you be

690
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,057
comfortable with talking kind of
thing, um, with interviews

691
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:24,807
rightfully so. A lot of people
walk into a lot of anxious

692
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:28,346
energy, like, whoa, man, like,
you know, great grimacing at the

693
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,581
idea of, I've got to talk to
this person for 30 minutes and

694
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,816
it's

695
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:34,226
going to be tough. Right. And
immediately that's a losing

696
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,635
game,

697
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:40,362
right? Immediately you walking
into that is. Just ultimate

698
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:43,692
failure. Right. And I always use
this as an example. Right? Like,

699
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:47,321
imagine yourself going to those
dreaded networking events that

700
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:50,981
you go to. Never like, you know,
no one kind of thing. Imagine

701
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:53,231
yourself walking into that same
kind of room, just very anxious.

702
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,166
Like I'm just going to go sit in
this corner and just kind of

703
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,101
hold

704
00:31:57,102 --> 00:32:00,852
my drink by the bar. Right. And
it's super uncomfortable. I've

705
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:05,666
been that person. It's the lamp.
Um, now imagine, you know,

706
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:07,361
stepping out that door and
playing this mental exercise

707
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,786
with

708
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:10,707
me, like, I always walk people
through this. Cause I think

709
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,477
mindset is mindset. Mindset is
module zero in my program,

710
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,247
right?

711
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:15,911
Like you're not going to get
far, unless you get your mindset

712
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,575
in

713
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,977
the right space. You can't go
through this whole experience.

714
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,001
Get one rejection then just like
go put the sheets over your

715
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:23,471
head.

716
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,716
And like, like, no, that's not
how it is going to work in

717
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:25,961
tablet

718
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,641
attack. Right. You've got to
keep chugging along. Um, the

719
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,321
back to

720
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,481
that example right now, imagine
if you walked into this

721
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:34,721
networking event, just knowing,
like you don't give a F about

722
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:38,021
what anyone thinks, anyone cares
what anyone says to you, like

723
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,732
imagine like how lifted you
would feel. Right? Like, just

724
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,382
like

725
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:44,112
whatever I'm just going and have
fun. Like I'm just go there and

726
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,211
meet people. Never go see these
people again, blah, blah, blah.

727
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,401
Let's go have fun. And you just
walk in. So imagine that. How

728
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,561
you

729
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,407
envision yourself, like I'm
there just having fun. Like

730
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,162
that's,

731
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:58,152
that's the point. And I try to
emulate this with people and get

732
00:32:58,152 --> 00:32:59,652
them into the right state. I
call it, um, I'm borrowing from

733
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:01,152
a lot

734
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:03,731
of different psychology or NLP
concepts that I've learned over

735
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,731
my time, but, you know, getting
yourself in the right space.

736
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,797
Bringing your energy in gets
kind of where we will be at some

737
00:33:10,797 --> 00:33:12,147
point, some people don't accept
it as much as others, some

738
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:13,497
people

739
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:15,326
do. And I am, I lean into that,
right? Like brand new energy

740
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,155
just

741
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:19,586
imagined you there to have fun.
And that's the kind of energy

742
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:23,067
that needs to be conveyed during
your interviews. Right? Not

743
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,946
saying being super quirky, be
super unprofessional, just like

744
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,701
dancing on the table. Just
saying, go in there. Just like.

745
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,456
I

746
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:30,671
don't really care what happens
at the end of his interview. I

747
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:31,885
just

748
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,886
want to get to know the company.
Like I just, you know, not being

749
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,987
tied to the result. I just want
to come here and have an

750
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:40,467
interview and have fun. And now
imagine again, flipping the

751
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:43,826
script, right. I'm the
interviewer and I see person a

752
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:46,856
come in kind of anxious energy,
like yeah. Yeah. I'm looking

753
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:50,277
forward. Thanks for having me
versus person B's like, Hey,

754
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,616
thanks for having me. Nice to
meet you. Great office space.

755
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,747
Like let's have some fun, like,
you know, tell me more about the

756
00:33:54,747 --> 00:34:00,122
company. It's kind of one of
those hack ways of getting,

757
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:02,221
improving your chances of the
job. Right. Just being more

758
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:05,342
likable. And again, I'm, don't
try to teach you being some

759
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:08,762
wildly crazy extrovert. I'm just
trying to teach you to be in a

760
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:12,811
better state. Right? You don't
get stumbled. When a tough

761
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:15,782
question comes up, you do take
those pauses. You do take those

762
00:34:15,782 --> 00:34:19,952
breaths. You don't freak out and
then your brain gets, you know,

763
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:23,641
it's happened to me many times
before where I've just one bad

764
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:25,409
question. Just kind of be slowed
down. Nowadays, I'm able to

765
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,177
catch

766
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,796
myself. If it happens, I'm just
catching myself and then bring

767
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,415
my

768
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:34,927
energy back up. And I actually
visualize a dial. Right. I, I

769
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,969
think visualization mindset has
been so important in my life.

770
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,891
Um,

771
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,167
shout out to Nick who taught me
all of this as one of my

772
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,382
coaches.

773
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:45,101
Right. I visually see a dial
like, okay, I'm being a little

774
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:48,402
too energetic. Let me dial it
down and I'll speak a little bit

775
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:52,782
slower. And my dots, my periods
of adopt on it. But if I feel

776
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:55,061
like the interview is getting
into a low I'll, turn it up a

777
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:57,326
little bit and kind of play
along kind of thing. And it's

778
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,591
not an

779
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:01,684
overnight thing. Right. You can
learn these through practice.

780
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,776
Um,

781
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:06,806
which is, I don't know if you
guys see, I always tell people

782
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:08,706
like, if you're not, if you're
in your early stage, um, or not,

783
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,606
or

784
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:13,407
you just haven't interviewed in
a while, or you're bad or not as

785
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:14,877
good as you want to be at
interview. There's literally

786
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:16,347
free

787
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,101
interviews on LinkedIn, right?
You do like one or two changes

788
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,855
on

789
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,836
your LinkedIn recruiters are
just bombing you emails. And all

790
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,816
you

791
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,362
have to do is just reply back
and say, sure, let's talk

792
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:26,907
tomorrow.

793
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:30,717
And boom, you have a free chance
to have that experience that I

794
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:31,991
was talking about at the bar,
right. Where I can walk into

795
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,265
this

796
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:36,896
bar, not give an F about what
person says to me, because it's

797
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:39,731
just a random recruiter. Right.
This person, isn't going to go

798
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:42,702
out there and say, don't hire
Kevin. Cause he didn't take this

799
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,791
thing very seriously, which is
what I did. I was going out on

800
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,972
LinkedIn, just seeing, trying
different tactics out, seeing

801
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:52,391
which got good responses and
just kind of seeing how many

802
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:56,021
interviews could I get to the
next round. Um, and those are

803
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,161
your, those are your reps,
right? That's free batting

804
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,301
practice

805
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,452
right there. Um, and I don't
think people, if you're feeling

806
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,824
like you're getting too nervous
during interviews, Go on

807
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:04,196
LinkedIn

808
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:05,697
and actually respond back to
those spammy recruiters that

809
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,197
say,

810
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,082
Hey, you want to talk? I have
the senior role position, even

811
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:10,967
though

812
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,637
I have zero years of experience
in my LinkedIn, I'm like, sure,

813
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:16,847
let's talk just for fun. And
that's the kind of, that's how

814
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:19,606
you get your reps in, right? It
was, it's a, it's not an

815
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:22,697
overnight process. It's can be a
monthly process and you'll get

816
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:26,867
better incrementally. And by the
time that dream job that I

817
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:30,106
mentioned before does land right
in front of you. You're ready to

818
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:30,317
nail it.

819
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:34,757
Bekah: I like that a lot. And I
like this idea of like getting

820
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,786
reps in. So as you're talking
about this, I was thinking, so I

821
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:40,976
like to. You know, lift heavy
weights and work out. But I

822
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:42,567
really, I like to jump high.

823
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:47,507
Kevin: too. I'm working on mine.
I'm trying to hit a 60 inch box

824
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:48,916
jump by the end of the year.

825
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,757
Bekah: Yes. That's exactly where
I was going with this. Okay. So

826
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:54,306
I'm short. So I always say like,
I have to compensate for that in

827
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,851
some way. And so I jump high and
so I'm like trying to think of,

828
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,396
I

829
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:02,737
think I hit 50 inches.

830
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,197
Kevin: Nice.

831
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:07,257
Bekah: I think maybe my highest
is 56, but

832
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,257
Kevin: Congratulations. Yeah,

833
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:11,111
Bekah: it was, it was, it was
work and it was reps, right?

834
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:12,835
Like

835
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:16,407
you're growing in strength, but
one of the things approaching

836
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:20,876
that box, like, okay, I'm 61 and
three quarters inches. And so

837
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,286
that box is pretty high up on
me. So when you're standing next

838
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:23,696
to

839
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:28,061
it, yeah. Wow. This is really
high. I don't think I'm going to

840
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:31,092
be able to do this. And I had
heard on a podcast somewhere,

841
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,562
somebody was like, just
visualize yourself doing it

842
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:34,032
first, because

843
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,942
if you set your mind up that
you're going to fail, you will

844
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:41,311
fail. And I was not a big
visualize as a person. I'm like,

845
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:42,796
this is kind of garbage, but
fine. I'm going to try it,

846
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,281
right?

847
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:47,501
Yeah. Close my eyes. Cause I
can't do anything with my eyes

848
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:51,882
open, close my eyes. I imagine
myself jumping on the top of all

849
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:53,382
of those boxes. And then I did,
and I was like, okay, maybe

850
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:54,882
there

851
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:59,202
is something to this, but it is
like, when you go in with that

852
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:01,302
failure mindset, you're not
going to be able to perform in

853
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,402
the way

854
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:06,822
that you want to. And so there
was something about imagining

855
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:08,411
what it looks like and what it
feels like. There's gotta be

856
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,000
some

857
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,071
kind of like physiological
reaction that happens when you

858
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:14,141
do

859
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:14,231
that.

860
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,132
Kevin: Yeah. Uh, what is it mind
over matter kind of thing,

861
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,902
right?

862
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:22,291
Like that's a saying for a real
reason, right? Like if you truly

863
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:26,161
don't believe that you're going
to do the best, then you're

864
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:27,571
definitely not going to be
right. But you're not going to

865
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,981
be even

866
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:32,492
at 50%, I'd argue. Right? Like,
or unless you just have all that

867
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,802
reps and experiences, which is,
you don't have to visualize, you

868
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:37,972
have what I call confidence
through competence. Right? You,

869
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:40,382
you have the confidence through
the fact that you've done it so

870
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:42,794
many times. But we, we could
rant on, I always do my

871
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:45,206
correlation

872
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:48,777
between exercise as well with,
with like right, with like how

873
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,471
Java is. I either do it with
like dating life or whatever,

874
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,136
uh,

875
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,981
exercise or business, all this
stuff correlates together.

876
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,676
Right?

877
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:57,582
Like that's why mindset is
module zero. Like this will

878
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,487
apply to not

879
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,356
just your job hunt. This will
apply to your landing on a 58

880
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:03,225
for

881
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:05,861
60, 56, 8 jump. Right. Um, and
on that note, they actually

882
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,456
actually

883
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:11,291
do teach that right. When you're
doing a boxer, like actually

884
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,851
stand on the box, get used to
that feeling of how high you

885
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,411
are,

886
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,541
kind of thing. Don't jump off of
it. Cause that's just going to

887
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:20,322
recipe for damaging over time,
but actually stand up on top of

888
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:23,652
it and feel how high you are off
the ground. So that when you do

889
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,021
do the jump you get, you're not
shocked when you get there and

890
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,751
you can finish, it don't fall
backwards. Like you actually sit

891
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,942
and then stand up kind of thing.
We can, we gotta do this. Bekah.

892
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:35,231
We gotta meet and just do box
jumps over and over and over.

893
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:38,981
Bekah: that's right. That's
right. I keep saying so Magnolia

894
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:43,061
JS this year was online. Last
year was online, but Kayla Sween

895
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:46,541
organize it this year and she
has she's certified in like us

896
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,902
powerlifting. She's got a
certification and I'm like next

897
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:52,181
year when this is in a physical
location. Yeah, I'm going to

898
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,460
come

899
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,231
and we are going to, we're going
to lift heavy things together.

900
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,001
So

901
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:03,041
Kevin, you need to you're in the
general area. You're closer than

902
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:03,461
I am in

903
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,722
Kevin: I'll make it somehow.
Yeah. Yeah. That's true. I am

904
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:06,112
close with.

905
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,472
Bekah: we'll find a way

906
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:10,166
Kevin: If you're going there,
Bekah, I have no excuse. Yeah.

907
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:15,028
Bekah: Okay. So you said that
you were doing coaching. You've

908
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:17,008
kind

909
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:21,659
of like always been doing this
coaching thing. And so at some

910
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,039
point it became more. Something
that you really embraced and

911
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,573
decided to take on and share
with other people. And I feel

912
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:31,107
like

913
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,639
that could be a really scary
decision to make. Was it just

914
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,759
something that just came
naturally? Or did you think that

915
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,978
well, you know, I've, I've been
doing this, I might as well do

916
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:42,808
it

917
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,579
in a more formalized way and
then just.

918
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:51,233
Kevin: yeah. Reflecting back on
it and feeling the emotions.

919
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,493
Right. It's anytime I do
anything new, it's always a

920
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,753
little bit of

921
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:55,373
scary, right? Like I'm not
someone who is very risk

922
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,993
adverse.

923
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:01,943
Let me say it that way. Um, I, I
tend to stop and think about it

924
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,413
for 10 hours before even picking
up a pen and kind of that kind

925
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:04,883
of

926
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:07,534
thing. Um, it's not good, but
I'm on it. But part of me is

927
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:10,184
always

928
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:11,383
been a little entrepreneurial.
Like I said, like I always knew

929
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,582
I

930
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:18,219
was going to do something on my
own. Um, I got to go and just

931
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,419
say, it's probably just because
of the surroundings, the people

932
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:20,619
I

933
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,778
was around, seeing people who
are much more brilliant than me,

934
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:24,937
much

935
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:28,809
smarter, like this is how they
create their own happiness and

936
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:32,079
wealth, right? Like I'll, I'll
say it. I love money. So they

937
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,248
create their own wealth and
their own happiness and their

938
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,417
own

939
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:38,259
freedom and, you know, creating
their own business. Um, so

940
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:41,018
coaching definitely came in
through rice surroundings. My

941
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:45,849
mentors, I am a. Results in
product of a bunch of mentoring

942
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,208
and books and experiences and
conferences and all of these

943
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:52,688
workshops, right? I've, I've
spent a lot on, you know,

944
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:55,898
investing in myself, which has
given me the ability to say, you

945
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:59,259
know what? I've seen all these
other people do it. A lot of my

946
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,018
idols, people I respect in the
community are doing it this way.

947
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:08,079
Um, I'm going to try it myself
and it again, it's it was scary,

948
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,561
but when you really break it
down, it's, it's, it's. The

949
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,043
steps

950
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:16,583
are simple, right? To start your
own website, get your own first

951
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,804
few clients. And all of that,
like, you know, create a

952
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,474
structure, create a program it's
simple. Right? We could write it

953
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:24,594
right now in like one or two
minutes. The execution is always

954
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:28,344
the scary part. Right. Things.
Getting a job can be simple. The

955
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:31,704
steps doing it are not easy
sometimes though. Right. So, uh,

956
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,273
Going through the step of, you
know, deciding I'm going to

957
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:37,824
create my own, you know, I was
already consulting doing my own,

958
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:40,164
like little private, you know,
website consulting. So coaching

959
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:43,389
wasn't too far off. Um, but
there was a little bit of. Uh,

960
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:46,614
yeah,

961
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:49,193
look, let me say it this way. I
still get imposter syndrome to

962
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:52,393
this day, right? Can I go out
there and start my own coaching

963
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:55,333
program? Right? Like, can I
messaged this person and

964
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,733
convinced this person I'm good
enough? Right. Like it still

965
00:42:57,733 --> 00:43:01,514
happens to me. I think I call it
your associate path if you don't

966
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:05,264
get a little bit of it. So I
think you have to have a little

967
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:08,114
bit of it because it's, and
that's the good thing, right? I

968
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:10,003
know I'm going in the right
direction. Let me say it that

969
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:13,614
right. I know in the ceilings
coming, it's something I should

970
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:17,934
be. Um, or I should try to
challenge myself as kind of

971
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:21,384
thing. Um, and that's just the
whole mindset behind it right

972
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:23,334
now. You're reframing imposter
syndrome. I'm getting it. This

973
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,284
is

974
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:27,504
okay. I should be getting this
and now I should continue on

975
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,724
kind

976
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:30,863
of thing. And that's what,
getting your reps and feels

977
00:43:30,863 --> 00:43:32,002
like.

978
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,349
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of
pursuing what scares you,

979
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:37,344
Kevin: Yeah.

980
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:41,028
Bekah: which is hard, especially
if you don't have a good support

981
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:44,535
system or community around it.
Um, so I, I'm kind of taking

982
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:48,042
this

983
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:51,523
and a little bit of a different
direction, but you've got all

984
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:53,833
this experience working with a
lot of different people. You've

985
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:57,793
talked about taking interviews
and trying different things out.

986
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:02,773
So if, if you looked at tech
right now and you saw what the

987
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:07,344
interview process looked like,
and you could totally reset. And

988
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,399
from here on out, everybody
would just follow Kevin's way.

989
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,454
What

990
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,313
does Kevin's way of interviewing
look like?

991
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:16,539
Kevin: On the interviewee side,
like if I'm trying to get a job.

992
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,119
Dan: No from the interviewer,
like if you're.

993
00:44:20,768 --> 00:44:20,978
Kevin: Okay.

994
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,978
Dan: The, the process of, you
know, the tech, the tech

995
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:26,858
interview process is like feels
kind of messed up to a lot of

996
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:29,679
people. I think. So, you know,
you probably have unique

997
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,128
perspective having seen both
your own and, uh, you know, your

998
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:37,199
mentees, um, you know, going
through the process. So what,

999
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:37,958
what can we do to fix it?

1000
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:40,468
Kevin: This is an interesting
question. When think about it

1001
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:41,598
and

1002
00:44:41,798 --> 00:44:44,648
ideas are going to flow to me as
I'm talking, I have some ideas,

1003
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:51,668
so, um, With the idea of remote
being very, very important

1004
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,648
nowadays. I think everyone's got
to kind of learn a little bit

1005
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:57,278
better, be better on camera,
right? Sadly, Zoom's kind of the

1006
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,248
way I don't love it to love or
hate. I love working remote, but

1007
00:45:00,248 --> 00:45:01,688
at the same time, I think I
don't want to fully embrace a

1008
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:03,128
world

1009
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:06,969
where we always have to stare at
a camera. Um, but as an

1010
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,148
interviewer, I want to make sure
that person's comfortable.

1011
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:14,954
Communicating on camera as well.
Right? So to be able to convey

1012
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,399
ideas in this challenging times
of how well can you work

1013
00:45:17,399 --> 00:45:19,844
remotely

1014
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:23,188
kind of thing. Um, I like the
idea of structured interviews.

1015
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:26,503
As

1016
00:45:26,503 --> 00:45:29,744
in, if we had a thousand
applicants, every single

1017
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:31,514
thousand, these applicants would
be asked the exact same

1018
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:35,414
questions. Um, because I think
the idea and shout out to Test

1019
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:39,248
Double, right? They did this
during my interview. Um, one of

1020
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:41,078
the comms that did this to me
was Test Double. They, you get

1021
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:42,908
to

1022
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,274
talk, you know, as much as you
want and you have very

1023
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,639
structured

1024
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:47,018
rubric of what you've, what,
like what we're looking for kind

1025
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:48,397
of

1026
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:52,434
thing. Right? Because otherwise,
if you have. Um, what was it?

1027
00:45:52,494 --> 00:45:54,353
King of the hill. They had two
football fans, right. Talking,

1028
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:57,534
right. Like if they hit it off
talking about football, ideally

1029
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:59,409
like that person isn't might not
be the best fit, but because

1030
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:01,284
they

1031
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:02,498
kicked off so well, like that
person got the check mark kind

1032
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:03,712
of

1033
00:46:03,713 --> 00:46:05,153
thing, and that's very
subjective. So I think we kind

1034
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,593
of

1035
00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:08,048
have to have these metrics, like
very standardized questions

1036
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:09,502
where

1037
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:16,088
everyone gets asked. Um, other
ideas, let's see, um, you know,

1038
00:46:16,088 --> 00:46:18,443
we're seeing this big movement
of almost anonymous applications

1039
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,798
of

1040
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:22,718
like, you don't see the age of
race, the gender of anything

1041
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:24,607
kind

1042
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:26,813
of thing. Um, that is something
I think phase one needs to have.

1043
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:29,018
I

1044
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:33,248
think there's almost this screen
that doesn't show does this

1045
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,248
person look like me? Does this
person have the same background

1046
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:42,728
as me? Um, in order to pass the
test kind of thing. Um, I think

1047
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,128
that's super important as part
of phase one of

1048
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:48,403
Bekah: to pause for one second
there. I know, like I put you on

1049
00:46:48,403 --> 00:46:49,648
the spot with this question, but
I want to push back a little

1050
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,893
bit.

1051
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:53,818
Um, so I like one of the things
that, that I think about. I

1052
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:56,292
don't

1053
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:59,744
have my mind made up about this.
Right? Like I think that it's

1054
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:04,123
very interesting to have this
idea of like blind resume

1055
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:10,034
reviews, but at the same time,
there comes a certain privilege

1056
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:18,068
with what gets put on a resume.
You know, so for people who

1057
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,248
haven't had the same privileges
who have not had the same

1058
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:27,548
advantages of people that are
growing up with, you know,

1059
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:33,338
parents who have connections or
who have money than somebody who

1060
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:38,469
has worked really hard to get
where they are. W maybe may, and

1061
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:39,743
maybe there's a different way to
address this on a resume that

1062
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,017
I'm

1063
00:47:41,018 --> 00:47:44,093
just totally missing, but I
could see their resumes being,

1064
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:47,168
not at

1065
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,593
the top of the pile, just
because they haven't had the

1066
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:50,018
same

1067
00:47:50,018 --> 00:47:51,503
opportunities. And I don't
really, you know, I don't mean

1068
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:52,988
to

1069
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:56,199
put you on the spot here, but I
just wonder if there's ways to

1070
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:02,454
capture that in. To allow you to
move forward and processes that,

1071
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:05,813
that haven't done a really good
job of taking that into

1072
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:06,713
consideration.

1073
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:10,878
Kevin: And here's the response I
could get out with that, right?

1074
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:13,159
It's not just resumes in stage
one, by the way, I'm going to

1075
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,913
make that clear. Right. Um,
there are not even a cover

1076
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:16,667
letter, but

1077
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:19,579
just certain questions that they
can tell can this burden, does

1078
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:22,579
this person have good written
communication as well? One

1079
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:26,583
interview I did last year. I
think school is 15 individual

1080
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,188
questions. It was a great
company, 15 individual

1081
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:29,793
questions,

1082
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,034
like, you know, typing out
almost a paragraph. Each I got

1083
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,204
through

1084
00:48:34,264 --> 00:48:37,114
that interview based on just
those written things. Right?

1085
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,784
Like, cause again, kind of
revisiting back on the idea of,

1086
00:48:39,903 --> 00:48:41,583
of remote work. Like, can you
communicate well through

1087
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,263
written?

1088
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,093
Like, can you convey your idea
of how this code works through

1089
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:46,893
just

1090
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:49,693
slack messages kind of thing.
Um, so on top of the resume, And

1091
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,493
I'm

1092
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:55,134
actually not a fan of resumes.
Let me say it that way. Like I

1093
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:56,449
don't put, I think people put
way too much weight on a resume.

1094
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:57,764
It

1095
00:48:57,764 --> 00:49:00,914
is very true. Recruiters really
do only spend five to 10 seconds

1096
00:49:00,914 --> 00:49:03,583
looking at them. I've asked this
amongst dozens of people and it

1097
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:07,213
is very true. Um, so with
digital, if you're like just

1098
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:09,208
lacking that experience, um, or
not putting it in the right

1099
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,203
spot,

1100
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:12,298
that's eye appealing. Right?
It's a big thing that I always

1101
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:13,392
do all

1102
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:16,483
too. Um, it does suck that
unfortunately you're gonna have

1103
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:21,353
to. Put out, thrown out kind of
thing. Um, ideally people would

1104
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:25,313
use that in tandem with certain
questions that can kind of,

1105
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:26,633
again, going back to the replay,
this person touched on this

1106
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,953
idea,

1107
00:49:27,994 --> 00:49:31,554
this person mentioned his or her
experience in this world. Right.

1108
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:34,253
And that kind of ticks them off
to the next phase kind of thing.

1109
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:39,083
Um, it's a very tough question.
Cause I I've asked, I've been

1110
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:42,893
thinking about this a lot before
and it works for some

1111
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:46,358
organizations where they do have
the resources. Let's just say a

1112
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,268
hundred applicants, if not
thousands of applicants and can

1113
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:50,703
kind of do it, unfortunately
kind of world, we live in where

1114
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:52,108
it's

1115
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:55,628
super busy. Right. We have to
have these certain it's the same

1116
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:59,108
way I feel about standardized
tests, right? Like people, you

1117
00:49:59,108 --> 00:50:02,949
have to take the sat or act kind
of thing, but what, is there a

1118
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:04,584
better way to do it that
doesn't, that can scale. Sadly.

1119
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,219
I don't

1120
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:08,918
think there's too many good
solutions out there that would

1121
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,588
scale, but that's kind of the
world we live in. I'm not

1122
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,343
embracing it. I'm not saying I,
I kind of say screw that and

1123
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,098
don't

1124
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:18,338
get your job through the
application process anyway. But,

1125
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,449
um, giving, like you have to get
the application process, uh,

1126
00:50:23,304 --> 00:50:24,998
Yeah, well, ideally it's not
just your resume. It's your

1127
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:26,692
answering

1128
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:29,873
some certain questions. Then you
move on to some sort of 20

1129
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:32,454
minutes. Let's get to know you
kind of co phone call kind of

1130
00:50:32,454 --> 00:50:35,634
thing. And again, depending on
the rule, like, is communication

1131
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:38,873
vital, like in an agency where
you're consulting with your

1132
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:40,928
clients? Well, can you pass
these markers or is it okay that

1133
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:42,983
you're

1134
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:45,534
just working with your team of
eight people developers and

1135
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:47,454
you're good enough to work with
just these eight kind of thing.

1136
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:52,728
Those are kind of things that I
would kind of look for. Really

1137
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:55,639
drawn out nuts. Pretty vague
answer. I'm giving so far.

1138
00:50:56,063 --> 00:50:57,653
Bekah: Well, he has a a hard I'm
like, Hey, redo all the

1139
00:50:57,653 --> 00:50:59,243
interview

1140
00:50:59,244 --> 00:51:02,034
process right here. Right now in
five minutes. Go.

1141
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:05,108
Kevin: I will say I will share
one that has worked pretty well

1142
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:08,199
with me. Um, again, I'm just
experimenting. Let's see what

1143
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,068
works. If I, I throw in a video
application, so I would actually

1144
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,348
record a. I'm using a tool
called Loom, just record a two

1145
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:16,628
minute

1146
00:51:16,628 --> 00:51:19,659
video and I see you nod your
head. Like I love Loom. I use it

1147
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,539
all the time. They just lower
down the free tier though. So

1148
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:28,059
I've got to go bump it up, but,
um, I actually would record a

1149
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:31,628
Loom video and let it link
whatever. And I would send it to

1150
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,659
people on the application. Like,
Hey, by the way, like, if you

1151
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:35,933
want to see my video
application, I record a one or

1152
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:37,207
two minute

1153
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:42,534
video explaining why like that,
that little extra effort. Got me

1154
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:45,684
so many more results, like so
many more like, Hey, loved your

1155
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:46,809
video. Like let's talk kind of
thing. Let's set up an

1156
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:47,934
interview.

1157
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,563
Um, and this was back when I
didn't have as much experience.

1158
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:55,344
Right. So I would just use Loom
link it to like

1159
00:51:55,494 --> 00:51:57,603
thekevintruong.com slash,
company name, have that redirect

1160
00:51:57,603 --> 00:51:59,712
to the

1161
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:03,923
Loom video. And while you're
standing out one on the 99th

1162
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:07,733
percentile, like, no one's doing
that. So you really sticking out

1163
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,563
kind of thing. And I'm not
saying that's part of my ideal

1164
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:11,393
world

1165
00:52:11,603 --> 00:52:12,698
because you gotta respect your
time. So that's the videos take

1166
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:13,793
a

1167
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:14,244
long time.

1168
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:18,684
Bekah: I just, there was, um,
there was a thread on Twitter,

1169
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:23,724
uh, and I'll link it in the show
notes, but the Dustin McCaffrey

1170
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:27,264
was talking about working on
Upwork and that's what he was

1171
00:52:27,264 --> 00:52:31,074
doing. He was sending Looms to
people and he had little

1172
00:52:31,074 --> 00:52:32,933
experience, but he set his price
to a hundred dollars an hour,

1173
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,792
but

1174
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:39,503
it was enough that I think he
said the first job, he made $85

1175
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:43,798
an hour, but he was pretty new
and that's, uh, A pretty good

1176
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:47,398
hourly wage. And it all came
because there was this

1177
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:50,039
personalized, I think it was
personalized, but this loom

1178
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:51,778
message and it was something
that differentiated him and

1179
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:53,517
built

1180
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,108
instant credibility with the
people who were viewing it,

1181
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:56,668
which

1182
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:58,378
is, you know, I think like
taking risks and chances like

1183
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:00,088
that. And

1184
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:01,753
kind of what you're talking
about can be the thing that

1185
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:03,418
separates

1186
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:04,409
you from everyone. Yeah.

1187
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:07,639
Kevin: That's really fantastic.
Thanks for sharing that. Because

1188
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,183
again, it kind of proves it's
not just, it works for me. It

1189
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:10,727
works

1190
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:13,789
for Upwork, which you're going
at globally, competing against

1191
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:17,659
people. So to get a gig through
that is fantastic.

1192
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:20,033
Dan: Well, we're kind of getting
close to the end, I think, of

1193
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,728
our

1194
00:53:21,757 --> 00:53:23,662
time. Um, so I'd love to the, I
mean, the thing that stuck out

1195
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:25,567
to

1196
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:28,657
me most is the visualization
step. You know, that you were

1197
00:53:28,657 --> 00:53:32,127
talking about that idea. You
have any other sort of general,

1198
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:35,597
large

1199
00:53:35,597 --> 00:53:37,502
idea chunks of advice for
people? Um, starting out the,

1200
00:53:37,502 --> 00:53:39,407
you know,

1201
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:42,018
starting out the interview, I
guess in the interview process,

1202
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:43,007
you know, in any way.

1203
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:50,878
Kevin: Yeah. Um, on the idea of
a visualization and in mindset,

1204
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:54,120
that stuff is just, again,
module zero for me. It's the

1205
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,313
stuff

1206
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:57,603
that's going to differentiate
you more than most people,

1207
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:58,893
right?

1208
00:53:58,893 --> 00:54:01,713
Like you can't just get hit once
knocked down and he called it

1209
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:04,952
quits kind of thing. Um, another
trick of that I've learned

1210
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:07,353
through someone else during if
you're feeling this anxiety

1211
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:11,583
during, um, during interviews or
before an interview, right?

1212
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:13,187
Imagine being hugged by your
most favorite person in the

1213
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:14,762
world,

1214
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:18,652
right. That Wharf that just kind
of comes over you again, it gets

1215
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:21,413
really Louie kind of like this
weird world that people like

1216
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:26,688
that. So BS, once you try it,
right, it's the whole. Um, you

1217
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:28,788
know, power pose or like just
standing out of your arms over

1218
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:32,117
your head and giant grinning
smile. Right. You can't help but

1219
00:54:32,117 --> 00:54:34,232
feel great. Right. So before I
would go into interviews, I

1220
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,347
would

1221
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:39,288
go in hype myself, up in the
bathroom, doing these little

1222
00:54:39,288 --> 00:54:40,922
traits before this podcast, I
was going to getting sure I

1223
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:42,556
wasn't

1224
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:47,927
like a hot mess, which I'm sure
I am, but, um, let's see. Other,

1225
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:55,577
other tricks or general advice.
The big concept I love to teach

1226
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:58,847
is that job getting a job
interview or getting your tech

1227
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:03,527
job can be a lot of fun. There's
a wrong way to do it, which is

1228
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:06,677
what I see. Maybe 67% of people
doing it. They play it as a

1229
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:10,128
numbers game, which is like, I
have to apply to 20 jobs by the

1230
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:12,182
end of the week. I'm like,
that's so silly, right? Like how

1231
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:14,236
about

1232
00:55:14,237 --> 00:55:17,657
you applies to just three jobs
and give it your best effort on

1233
00:55:17,657 --> 00:55:18,662
each of those three, because
you're going to get a lot

1234
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:19,667
further

1235
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:23,568
than just doing. Blanketed
application process, which I see

1236
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:26,268
a lot of people do. They don't,
you know, they use the same

1237
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:29,268
resume. They use the same cover
letter. They kind of just copy

1238
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:30,587
and paste things, which is fine.
You've got to do that

1239
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:31,906
eventually,

1240
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:34,967
but I always tell people if
given one week and you had the

1241
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:37,366
option

1242
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,672
between spending five hours
applying to 10 jobs or five

1243
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:39,977
hours

1244
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:45,947
applying to two jobs, I'd always
pick the two jobs. And that may

1245
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:47,162
not sound like a lot. It does.
It is a lot of time for some

1246
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:48,377
people.

1247
00:55:49,157 --> 00:55:51,858
You know, apply for the job,
find networks around to find

1248
00:55:51,858 --> 00:55:54,318
connections, go on LinkedIn
message people say, Hey, I just

1249
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,708
applied for this job. Like, let
me know like what your thoughts

1250
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,228
are kind of thing. And just
having those fun conversations.

1251
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,102
And that's what I mean by
getting the job interview can be

1252
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,616
fun.

1253
00:56:03,677 --> 00:56:05,507
Right? I've done it before. I've
enjoyed the process. I've

1254
00:56:05,507 --> 00:56:07,337
enjoyed

1255
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:12,228
meeting random people. I've
enjoyed just walking out, not

1256
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:14,958
caring if I got the job or not.
And that's the great mentality

1257
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,283
when you're not tied to the idea
of. Man, this is my last hope.

1258
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:19,608
If

1259
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:20,658
I don't get this job, I don't
know what I'm going to do.

1260
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:21,708
Right.

1261
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,588
Like remove all of that. Just
say, you know what it wasn't

1262
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:27,527
meant to be. Let's move on to
the next adventure adventure

1263
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:30,557
experience. Right. Because I'm
sure you'll too can, can, can

1264
00:56:30,978 --> 00:56:32,597
attest to this is that all these
little experiences have built

1265
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,216
you

1266
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:38,268
up to who you are too. And those
were necessary, right? There was

1267
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:41,478
a lot of graded experiences, a
lot of not so great ones, but

1268
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:44,387
they made you who you are today
and embracing that it's kind of

1269
00:56:44,387 --> 00:56:49,458
very stoic stoicism kind of like
approach to it. You've got to go

1270
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,947
through the, through those
challenges in order to come out

1271
00:56:52,728 --> 00:56:56,148
and by framing it as a fun
challenge, framing it as, oh,

1272
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:58,487
well, let's see what happens.
Right. You can make it a lot of

1273
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:03,137
fun. It doesn't have to be a
dreadful process. You can really

1274
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:05,012
get a lot out of it and, and
see, not yourself just grow in

1275
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:06,887
your

1276
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:10,217
tech career, but also just
personal development wise. Um,

1277
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:14,507
you'd be a lot happier, not
getting eight rejection letters,

1278
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:18,197
only getting two, but then like,
Hey, how can I learn and improve

1279
00:57:18,197 --> 00:57:21,438
on those two verses got another
one hit delete and just kind of

1280
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,307
move on, right. Stop, reflect on
it. What can we do improve that

1281
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:29,208
process? Um, so I think that's
probably my next biggest point,

1282
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:33,432
right. The way you're applying
for jobs can be really fun and

1283
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:38,023
enjoyable so you can choose the
painful way, or you can choose a

1284
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:40,572
way that you're going to grow
guaranteed. I guarantee if you

1285
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:43,123
follow certain steps, you will
become a better person on the

1286
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:45,882
end. You may not get a job, but
you will be ready for the next

1287
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:46,693
one. I guarantee it.

1288
00:57:47,702 --> 00:57:50,583
Bekah: I love that. I love that
idea of it's personal growth.

1289
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:52,967
Right. That's excellent. So
thank you so much, Kevin, for

1290
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:55,322
sharing

1291
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:57,873
all of this with us, there's so
many great things that, that

1292
00:57:57,902 --> 00:58:01,413
practical tips and advice and
things that people can go

1293
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:04,713
through. So, um, we really
appreciate you sharing this with

1294
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:05,583
us here today.

1295
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:08,242
Kevin: And I thank y'all too.
Thank you so much for having me

1296
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:09,472
really appreciate it. I had a
good time.

1297
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,038
Dan: Thanks, Kevin.

1298
00:58:11,563 --> 00:58:12,012
Bekah: Bye.

1299
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:13,163
Kevin: right. Bye-bye.

1300
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,983
Bekah: Thank you for listening
