00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,490
Dan: Episode three. Yeah. Uh,
sorry. Nick was a distracted me

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:51,380
on slack and side. Uh, Uh, come
on. That's not how I live my

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,990
life, I live my life, one
distraction at a time. Anyway,

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
um, today we have a great
episode. We talked with Helen

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,870
Griffin, who is a full-stack
developer and a founder. And, um,

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,719
yeah, we talked about her journey
through tech and, um, talked a

17
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,150
lot about her experience as a
founder of her two companies. Um,

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,150
Uh, State of Developers and
Jovial. And so those two

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,590
companies concentrate a lot on,
um, developer, personal health of

20
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,700
developers and that things like
burnout and stuff like that. Um,

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,420
so it was really interesting.

22
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,079
Bekah: Yeah, I love talking to
Helen. She's a lot of fun and I

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,650
love the idea that she's a
multi-passionate person. She's

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,829
got all of these things that
she's doing. She's excited to

25
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,079
talk about them and to share what
she's doing. And there's so many

26
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,984
great moments. This episode,
there was one moment. I can't

27
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,215
remember which one it was, but I
was like taking a sip of coffee

28
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,034
and Helen said something. I
choked, literally choked on my

29
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,215
coffee because I was laughing.
And then it took me a solid

30
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:04,295
couple of minutes to get past
that. But, uh, she was a lot of

31
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,015
fun to have.

32
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,849
Dan: Yeah, no, I had to actually
block your video screen from like

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,180
looking at it so that we didn't
just have a total meltdown in the

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,479
middle of the episode, but, uh,
no, it was fine. We laughed a lot

35
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,050
and, um, Helen was great. Uh, so
yeah, it was a, it was a good

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,330
episode and, uh, I think you're
going to enjoy it.

37
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,562
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

38
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,443
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

39
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:31,492
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

40
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:42,661
you enjoy this episode. Today's
random question is what is one

41
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,691
thing you would like to learn
more about, but have no reason

42
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:53,640
to? So my name is Bekah I am a
technical community builder from

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,760
a small town in Ohio. And one
thing I would like to learn more

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,480
about, I don't know, it's either,
um, like trees or birds. They're

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,037
both like very fascinating. What
is the eye roll there Dan?

46
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,381
Dan: You stole mine! That's
exactly what I was going to say.

47
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,251
Bekah: I get to go first. So now
you need to think of something

48
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:22,945
else. there's there's a website
that has, like, people can submit

49
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:27,955
sounds of birds and where they
are hearing those sounds. So

50
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,955
there's recording of that and I'm
like, there there's, there's a

51
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:35,545
really cool project here, have
not, not figured it out yet. So.

52
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:43,276
Dan: Um, oh, well, hi, I'm Dan. I
do web development in Cleveland,

53
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,885
Ohio, and yeah, man, I was going
to do, I like knowing about

54
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:54,795
things that I see, you know, it's
like, There's like, it's just

55
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,475
like really cool to be able to
like, look at things and know

56
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:59,836
what they are. Right. It's, it's
a strange thing that to say out

57
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:03,526
loud, I guess. But, um, you know,
since Bekah stole the, that one

58
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:06,675
from me, I I'll go like, you
know, architecture or something

59
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:09,346
like that, you know, being able
to like wander around a city and,

60
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:15,116
you know, be like, oh, you know,
Thomas Jefferson was drinking

61
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:20,971
something, I don't know,
something like that. Yeah. uh,

62
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,680
that's going to be that's my
second place answer,

63
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:27,920
Helen: Okay. Okay. Um, all right.
That leaves me. What's up. Y'all

64
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm Helen. Um, I am a full stack
developer. I'm from Midwest. Um,

65
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:41,810
howdy. I think to answer that
question, I think I would like to

66
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,930
learn about some form of martial
art. I have no reason.

67
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,130
Dan: a good one

68
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,211
Bekah: Really good one.

69
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:53,370
Helen: But I would still like to
learn. Some form of martial know.

70
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,790
It would be Jiu Ji... Jiu Jitsu I
can never pronounce it. So that's

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,391
probably something I won't learn
since I can't pronounce it. So I

72
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:07,651
just stay with karate since I
could pronounce that. Um, don't

73
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:13,290
know want to learn it because I'm
not flexible. I know. That's it

74
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,391
while I work, I don't even stand
it. So I breath hard going

75
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,701
upstairs. So we see how that
works out.

76
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,600
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
feel

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,021
Helen: Yeah.

78
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,971
Bekah: been my first answer now
that you said that I'm like,

79
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:30,261
yeah, Brazilian, Jiu Jitsu.

80
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:33,136
Helen: I just want to, I guess,
growing up, I used to watch

81
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:37,365
movies, 80 movies, so they always
have some kind of karate scene. I

82
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,646
don't care, wherever the fight
scene, it always turned into a

83
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:43,516
karate scene I'm like, how are
you from Chicago? Are you start

84
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:47,415
karate? I don't... make it make
sense.

85
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:51,495
Bekah: Okay, so this is great. My
brother, my older brothers, I

86
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:54,286
have two brothers, an older one,
a younger one. When in that, that

87
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:59,625
nineties era of karate fighting
scenes, used to love them and

88
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,636
like, especially Chuck Norris
movies. And so

89
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,250
Helen: Yeah.

90
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:06,706
Bekah: them on the VCR and then
like play them in like slow and

91
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:11,776
mimic the action so he could
learn I sit there and watch him

92
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:12,766
the thing.

93
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:13,511
Helen: Yes.

94
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,271
Bekah: 100% feel you on

95
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:20,161
Helen: my goodness. Yes, I, yeah.
I, all of the movies, there was

96
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,170
some karate. What's dude that use
to be in Dirty Dancing,

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,151
blonde-haried guy. He passed
little while back.

98
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:25,701
Bekah: Patrick Swayze.

99
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:30,391
Helen: He had a Roadhouse that
movie, a lot of karate, how y'all

100
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:34,230
from the south and y'all doing
karate? Saying not to be. I'm not

101
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,255
trying to be. Any ism, but I'm
just saying everybody know how to

102
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:42,435
break out into karate. It's just
like a musical Everybody know how

103
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,725
to break out into a song.

104
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:55,245
Bekah: Oh, my gosh. is so
amazing. I'm so glad that this

105
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:59,055
was the random intro question,
but I very much appreciate this.

106
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:04,516
Thanks Helen, for being here with
us today. Um,

107
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,505
Helen: I don't got nothing else
to do so. appreciate it.

108
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,930
Bekah: All right, get into your
story. We like to get the story

109
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:20,630
everyone that comes the podcast.
So what has led you where you are

110
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,201
today?

111
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:27,446
Helen: Okay. Um, it started off
on is snowy winter night in

112
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:32,516
April. What I was, I thought, I
don't know. I don't know when.

113
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,971
Bekah: We're getting the birth
stories this season. This is

114
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,461
great special episode.

115
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:46,055
Helen: no, no. You know, my pop
pop raised me up to the sky she

116
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:52,175
said she has borns and no, no,
no, no. For real, I guess, I

117
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,776
guess to make it, to answer your
question, I started off my career

118
00:07:55,805 --> 00:08:00,000
as a front end developer. Um, or
a web developer at the time, I

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,521
didn't even know the difference
between front end and back end

120
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:06,690
back at the time. So I started as
a web developer and got my first

121
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,331
corporate gig, um, um, at
American greetings. Um, so that

122
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:17,821
was, that was my first corporate
gig. Um, and then sells front end

123
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:22,500
developer for quite some times.
So a good 10 years. And then, um,

124
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:28,500
I took, I decided to. Start a
startup. So I, for the past seven

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,000
years I've been doing a startup,
uh, or several startups or just,

126
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:38,760
but, uh, I guess most of that
time, what people don't tell you,

127
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:42,811
like when you launch a startup,
uh, you startup before. I never

128
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:47,280
worked in startup before. What
that is is it's equivalent to a.

129
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:54,706
Um, it's just an MBA program that
you don't get at the end of it.

130
00:08:54,706 --> 00:09:02,640
You don't get no certification,
no degree. Um, and you spend your

131
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,081
own money similar to like an MBA
program. You spend your own

132
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:16,980
money, uh, and the tuition always
goes up. So, yeah. so that's,

133
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,620
that's pretty much was my, the
story. I was a front end

134
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,225
developer. Um, now I say I'm a
full stack developer just based

135
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:28,905
on my experience, you know, just
have to learn as a, founder, you

136
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,355
have to make things work No.
matter what it's all up to you.

137
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,535
So you don't have another
department or another colleague

138
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:39,885
go and say, Hey, make this word,
do your fancy. woo woo You know,

139
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:43,301
you had to go learn it. So I
kinda like that. Um, a little bit

140
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:47,071
of backend stuff like that, and
that does gain some business

141
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:52,350
acumen well. um, I think the
last, last seven years has been

142
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,551
less development, the more
business development and just

143
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,951
learning the business world and
that's his own ecosystem. So

144
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,255
yeah. So now that I'm kind of.
And I don't want to say stepping

145
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:10,336
away from it, but, um, I kinda
like, uh, decide to go at a

146
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:15,135
slower pace while my startup, um,
and try to return back to the,

147
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:20,416
um, development and land and to
see the world, the, the world of

148
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:26,775
frameworks and the role of Jesus,
all the frameworks, all the

149
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,855
tools, all the expectations. Like
I'm going to be the job

150
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:33,676
descriptions. I'm like, oh Lord
Jesus. Well, who do you think you

151
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:41,100
have? You know, Um, I'm like,
okay, I am, I guess I'm back

152
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,331
into, I feel like I'm kinda like
at the beginning stages, you

153
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:48,421
know, there's some things I
realize where my gaps are. And so

154
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,780
I'm trying to fix that up and
stuff like that. So that's what

155
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm doing lately.

156
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,660
Bekah: Yeah, it's wild because
you know, you have that

157
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,760
experience of front end or full
stack even, and then this pivot.

158
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,431
You're focused on this other
thing you come back, you know,

159
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:09,591
and there's just so much tech
moves so quickly. I just want to

160
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:13,880
take a second talk about, like,
why did you jump into the startup

161
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,380
life to begin with? Like, what
about that was interesting to

162
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,681
you?

163
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,605
Helen: Uh, it wasn't the start of
that. Interesting to me, what was

164
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:28,125
interesting was I got tired of
getting laid off that that would

165
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:33,855
make anybody pivot. I think I
ended up, I was. The I was with

166
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:38,625
um, the organization for like six
years get laid off and then it

167
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,855
took another year before I get
another job got that job. And

168
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:47,355
then, um, and that company, oh my
God, that was like, what's that

169
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:51,346
show Housewives Housewives. or
whatever that.

170
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,990
Bekah: oh. Or the real Housewives

171
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,730
Helen: Housewives. I swear, that
was like the real Housewives of

172
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,201
executives or something like
that, that like we was in a

173
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,801
remote team and the amount of
mess that was going on with that

174
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:08,791
organization. Like when you find
out executives was punching some

175
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:14,431
other executive and that's the
great vibe is like, Oh, yeah. I

176
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,260
knew I was like, layoffs was
coming. I just don't know when

177
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,721
I'm just going to collect my
check from working with my

178
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:27,091
startup and just, yeah, I knew I,
yeah, so. I knew it was coming. I

179
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,721
just was like, well, I got laid
off before, so we see what

180
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:35,311
happens. Maybe they might change.
Maybe they, you know, whatever.

181
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:40,291
But, um, so yeah, I just, I think
I got tired of the layoffs and I

182
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,431
was like, and I was around, I got
exposed to other startup

183
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,071
founders. Somehow I went to our
event and it was nothing but

184
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:50,270
startup founders. I don't know
how I went to this vet. it was it

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,365
was supposed to be for like
developer. And tech people, and I

186
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,186
just assumed everybody was
developer. And that's when I got

187
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:03,525
exposed to startups and I started
to go onto other meetups and

188
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:07,186
stuff like that. And again, this
bows and at the time the scenario

189
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,836
was, Andy had some accelerators
that open up their workspace for

190
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,105
people to come and work. And I
just, once I found those people,

191
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:19,005
I just kind of like was like
white on rice. I just stuck on

192
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:22,591
them. I wouldn't. Just trying to
consume as much knowledge as

193
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:28,740
possible. So, yeah. Oh, here's a
funny story. This, this is how I

194
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,380
was so clueless about business.
Um, I was trying, once I found

195
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,980
out about this affiliate program,
I tried to apply for it. And he

196
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,500
was like, and he had no business
applying. Cause I didn't know

197
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,961
nothing about business. I didn't
have no problem. I was trying to

198
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,811
solve for nothing. I didn't know
nothing, but I still, I was

199
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:48,331
trying to apply for it. And a
guy, he was so kind, he just sent

200
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:51,150
me to the side. They tried to
explain stuff to me and he was

201
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,841
like, product are you building?
And that, and I was so lost when

202
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:58,591
he kept saying product. I was
like, no, I'm a web developer.

203
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,270
Like what you make fun. was like,
what you talking about? I'm not

204
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,971
trying to open up a small
business trying to because to me,

205
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:13,980
I thought products, which is what
you see at the retail stores. had

206
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,541
to be some kind of hardware or
some type of fabric, you know, it

207
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,696
wasn't. You know, had to be
somebody you get off a shelf or

208
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:26,475
off my hanger. That was a
product. didn't realize that, um,

209
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:31,576
a website was a product. I didn't
realize I was a product. just

210
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,905
like, no, I'm a web developer. So
that was funny. So, yeah. Yeah.

211
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:41,105
Dan: Well, that, that whole like
language barrier is, is true.

212
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,135
think of it a lot with
development stuff, you know? Uh,

213
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,466
but it's true. Any, any, any,
like you enter any realm that you

214
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:51,105
haven't been in before and
Language different, you know?

215
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,240
Helen: Oh, yeah.

216
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,025
Dan: an interesting, like, I
dunno, aspect to think about for

217
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,025
like, events like that, you know,
is like, where do you set that?

218
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,775
Where do you set the bar? You
know? Um, and like, what's there

219
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,405
in a world for so long. You talk,
you kind forget that people don't

220
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,166
like already know you speak,
know?

221
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:10,206
Helen: Yeah.

222
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:13,005
Dan: think that's easy. Like a
lot of people walking into a new,

223
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,946
realm, you know, experience that
a lot.

224
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,905
Helen: It is a face. A funny
thing I realized just came to

225
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:24,275
realization. Like reading in some
docs kept, it was like, you know

226
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,385
how you know, word, you know,
what a word means? And he kind

227
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,561
of. might want to say 70%
understand where there, where the

228
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,230
president's talking about, but
you'd like, there's still a

229
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,140
slight un-clarity in You're
trying to figure out I kept

230
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,591
getting pissed off. Every time I
kept reading all these dots,

231
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,461
Bekah: Yeah.

232
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,706
Helen: abstract something. I was
like, what the heck? And then I

233
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:52,035
realized what they're trying to
say is we simplify it. So you

234
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,975
don't have to write all this
boatload of code. All you got to

235
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:59,086
do is just write this one line of
code. was just, I was somebody

236
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:04,365
create tool where you could just
do a short command and you could

237
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:09,135
search and copy and retweets,
every word let's say abstract,

238
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:14,865
something in these dots. And they
say simple. be so much easier.

239
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,865
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's a
huge thing. Like we had talked

240
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:21,115
about that at some point. I think
there's an issue still up on

241
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:27,836
Virtual Coffees. I'm sorry, repo
where they're like a Chrome

242
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:31,946
extension, right? Like if you
it's specifically for. Web

243
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:36,235
development docs, you hover over
that thing there's a definition

244
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:40,255
for it, right? Like, because
there's so many things like

245
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:43,316
exactly what you're saying. Nope.
People don't remember them once

246
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,586
they're past a certain stage,
many people don't. And so there's

247
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:49,885
no definitions and you just kind
of have to fill in that education

248
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,515
for yourself. And it doesn't
matter if you're self-taught or

249
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,456
bootcamp or have a degree
because. And they gloss over

250
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:01,716
these things and there's so much
to learn so quickly that you're

251
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:06,125
not going to remember all of that
And so being able to have that

252
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:12,336
quick reference, there's like
somebody sent me, um, oh, it's a

253
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:16,336
tech blog and is so, so good. I
can't remember what it is right

254
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:21,796
now, but does that you hover over
something and gives other links.

255
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:24,736
It might be done in obsidian. So
it might be done through obsidian

256
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:29,685
publish. so it takes you to the
next thing, if you want to go. so

257
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,836
there's like examples, there's
definitions. Like this is what

258
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:36,885
documentation should have
available because not every.

259
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,965
Again, follow that linear
documentation structure. It

260
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:44,236
should be like a, choose your own
adventure documentation to help

261
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,536
you figure out what you need in
that moment.

262
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,931
Helen: Yeah, exactly.

263
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,641
Dan: uh, a product we're working
on right now. Um, there it is

264
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,931
that product right on, uh, a web
app that we're working on right

265
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,500
now. Um, we're trying to deal
with that same thing with not

266
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,050
inside the code or not
developers, but for people who

267
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,961
are using it, right. It's like
the first time you use it, or

268
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,830
first few times he use it, it's
all new and probably kind of

269
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,590
confusing, but it's meant to be a
tool that like you use a lot.

270
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:18,300
Right? And so once you get used
to. Uh, we don't want to like up

271
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,840
the thing with like tons of help
stuff, you know, and trying out

272
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,760
what level of like, you know, or
like, do we really do it? Just,

273
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,040
do we just have a button? Like
you're saying this like, show,

274
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,580
like explain everything to me,
you And then like a button that

275
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,861
says, okay, I'm good. I got this
now. You know,

276
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,881
Bekah: Yeah, it's there's a tab
or

277
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,721
Dan: pretty like set that level.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

278
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,101
Bekah: So give me all of the
links here

279
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,520
Helen: Yeah. yeah. I think that
people, we, we, we, we need to be

280
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,760
like, I understand the idea of
you just trying to simplify

281
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,441
things. You just trying to give a
basic UI so people can just get

282
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:58,310
in there and get work, but you
still haven't barrier. Before I

283
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,096
begin to work. Get used to this
environment. It's just like,

284
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:06,486
Yeah. I'm used to cook in my
kitchen, but you throw me in your

285
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:10,326
kitchen. I'm not going to start
cooking right away. I still got

286
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,445
to go figure out where you put
your pet pots and pans where the

287
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,695
salt and pepper makes sure you
have seasoning, you know, just

288
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:20,556
check out stuff, you know, find
where they're at, you know? Um,

289
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:25,266
and it isn't, I'm not going to be
able to just get up and just the

290
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:29,105
web up time and gonna be quick.
So I think we have to remember

291
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:33,921
that. Beyond the, what? The web
app or wherever at we building.

292
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:37,371
There's also another app we got
to focus before they even get to

293
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,641
get to there. It's called
onboarding. That's a whole, it's

294
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,230
all on the environment.

295
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,461
Dan: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
Onboarding is like, yeah, we talk

296
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,671
about that a lot. Um, we talked
about that a lot with Virtual

297
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,310
Coffee too is like the community,
right? Cause we got a lot of

298
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,990
stuff going on the same, same
situation, you know? Um, I don't

299
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,590
know. I could talk again for a
long time about this. There's

300
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:04,431
lot, a lot of, you know, a lot of
pieces to that puzzle and it's

301
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,980
all kind of interesting and
important. Um,

302
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,560
Helen: Yeah. think it's it's. I
think we should treat it just

303
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,510
like how some founders, they had
to put it in their schedule to go

304
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,090
back and their own, Um, apps and
web apps and products as if they

305
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,316
was a new. So they can see this
experience again, because you so

306
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,346
much time will go by. Cause
you're doing so much other stuff

307
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:33,215
that you forget and you don't
know what has broken what got

308
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:37,415
lost in translation. as
developers, we should do that to

309
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:42,605
be like, okay, let's pretend I'm,
I'm a user. This is my first time

310
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:46,836
in this environment. Or let's
pretend I'm a developer. I just

311
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:50,780
graduated. This was my first
time. And I'm. You know, just to

312
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,871
get an understanding, you know,
is equivalent to like how

313
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:59,270
executives to go in and do some
manual tasks, just to understand

314
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,631
what their teams go through once
in a while kind of thing. So.

315
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:08,135
Dan: Yeah, That is like good
advice for not just like the

316
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,625
owners, you know, but everybody
that's doing it. It's so easy to

317
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,566
get caught when you're like
caught in the weeds, you know,

318
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,465
like when you're living and
breathing a project for a long

319
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:20,915
time, you know, you lose sight
of. Like beginning. I don't even

320
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:24,036
know what the login or not the
login, but like the new user

321
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:26,586
screen looks like on this app
that I work on every day, you

322
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,786
know, because I haven't looked at
it for

323
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,621
Helen: Yeah.

324
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:33,036
Dan: a long, long time. Um, and
it's it's yeah, that's, of very

325
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:33,546
good advice.

326
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,560
Bekah: Well, like going back to
what you said about onboarding to

327
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,320
it's part of that, you know,
because I think that it doesn't

328
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,010
matter what stage you're at when
you join a new company. I just

329
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,211
joined company a month ago and
I've felt very comfortable to

330
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:50,300
give feedback like, Hey, this is,
this is what I thought when I

331
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,425
read this. And so maybe we can
add clearer documentation here,

332
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:56,875
right.

333
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:57,286
Helen: Yeah.

334
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:00,296
Bekah: everybody that's coming
new into a company, almost

335
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:04,885
everybody is going to have that
new experience and be able to

336
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:08,905
more clearly point out those
things make sure that, you know,

337
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:12,385
you, you have the most up-to-date
information, but sometimes like

338
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,486
you have to invite people to do
that. Right.

339
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:14,996
Helen: Yeah.

340
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,306
Bekah: if they feel like, oh,
you're just supposed to rush

341
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,070
through this thing not. Please
feel free to give us your

342
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,270
feedback on it, then you're
you're losing out on all of the

343
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,270
value that a new employee brings
to a position.

344
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:32,381
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. Especially,
they feel like you don't want to

345
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,560
hear it, then you definitely
screwed, you know?

346
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,750
Bekah: Like, oh, that takes too
much time. Like, we don't want to

347
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,441
have to do that.

348
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,000
Helen: Yeah.

349
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:45,942
Bekah: Okay, so Lee, I want to
talk a little bit about, so first

350
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:48,343
of all, I've been super impressed
with all of the stuff that you're

351
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:52,182
doing and you're always, I feel
like you're always on a drive to

352
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,093
learn and that's, what's so great
because I think that's the

353
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:59,532
mindset that everybody really
should have app. Asking questions

354
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:02,923
and talking about these things.
And so like, what you think that

355
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,853
you've learned from your past
that you're bringing with you to,

356
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,792
I feel like this is kind of like
the new stage of hell and you're

357
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,593
like moving into this new thing

358
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,347
Helen: Yeah.

359
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,732
Bekah: time other places. Do you
have thoughts on that?

360
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:19,557
Helen: Um, yeah, I get thoughts
on that. Um, let me think about

361
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:25,377
it. Uh, no, I do have thoughts.
Uh, as I say, one thing I learned

362
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:32,127
my whole experience is that, um,
life is hard. But a lot of times

363
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:36,958
you end up choosing your
struggles that? you're in so many

364
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:41,038
things are happening to you,
which is true. But then sometimes

365
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,928
it's like, you could have, you
have, um, you have a point where

366
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:49,557
you can make a choice, be like,
okay, no more, you know, and just

367
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:54,343
figure out some way to get out of
it or, um, Oh, even less than the

368
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,292
pain, if you can't get out of it,
because there there's some

369
00:23:56,292 --> 00:24:00,403
problems that are just huge. Um,
also mostly know, most

370
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:05,053
importantly, my past experience,
I learned that to learn how to

371
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:12,403
invest in you so many times had
to, um, to, especially by being a

372
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:17,803
startup founder, I had believe in
myself try and do something. Even

373
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,393
was not qualified, when I was
complete ignorant about

374
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:25,722
something. Um, and then most
important, I didn't have the

375
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:30,403
resources or the capital, you
know, or the network to educate

376
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:33,762
me on something. I had to go
learn it figure out what I didn't

377
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:37,873
know. And then go find out where
I can learn or get what I need to

378
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:44,173
know. Um, I think the first time
I had to drop $1,500 on to invest

379
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:50,292
in myself was like, okay, If we
go and do this, I know you just

380
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:55,903
got laid off. We go and do this.
We can do this. This is going to

381
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:59,593
give you closer to being a
startup founder. This is going to

382
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:03,573
have you close it to this person.
So this, you know, some people be

383
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,992
like, why would you do that?
That's not guaranteed.

384
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:06,313
Bekah: Yeah.

385
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,663
Helen: guaranteeing, which is
true. There's No, guarantee

386
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:12,083
whether you're going to, there's
going to be success after your

387
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,022
tasks. You've complete it. And
there's no, guarantee that you

388
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:19,403
even got to complete the task,
which is funny too, but you still

389
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:26,573
had to, I still have to learn to
invest in myself. now when now,

390
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:31,678
it's much easier to make
decisions. You know, cause I done

391
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:37,288
that. I made so many decisions,
both small and big. So it's like,

392
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:42,688
okay, what's my values while I'm
trying to attain. Now, this align

393
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:47,067
to, what I trying to do? Is this
a compromise or is this a trade

394
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:53,667
off is or sacrifice? know, so
it's much easier make these mini

395
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,938
choices that we make every day
kind of thing people might

396
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,617
prolong for months on.

397
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:00,788
Bekah: Yeah.

398
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:04,587
Helen: Yeah, and didn't make me
make y'all depressed.

399
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:06,982
Dan: no,

400
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,087
Helen: I got quiet real quick.
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,873
Dan: I was, I was trying to
process what you said. I think

402
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:15,593
that's, I think that was all
great. Um, I think one of those,

403
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:21,252
know, you talked, um, at the
beginning about how. You know,

404
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:24,462
doing the startup process or
whatever, like an MBA, you know,

405
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:27,492
this cost money and all this
stuff. And I think re like

406
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:31,663
framing it like that as a, as an
investment in yourself is, is

407
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:34,002
great. You know, it was a really
healthy way to look at it. And

408
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:36,583
it's true too. Right. And that's
just like this, this like

409
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,792
decision framework that you just
described, even if you don't like

410
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:43,272
call it a framework in your head.
Right. But like, just like muscle

411
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,913
memory almost, you know, you
practice it. And so you get good

412
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:49,887
at it. And being able to. Do that
where you, where you're looking

413
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:55,288
at a decision and, um, know how
to it apart and like figure out

414
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:57,238
what you're looking at. Right.
Just exactly, like you said, like

415
00:26:57,238 --> 00:27:00,538
a, is this sacrifice? Is this,
you know, sort of compromise,

416
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,157
like, I don't know, it's such a
valuable tool, um, or skill. Um,

417
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:10,337
and that's really cool and it's
my silence finished documents I

418
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,397
was to process that. Cause, um,
it was, uh, I don't know, it was

419
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,167
quiet and it was really well put,
I thought,

420
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,103
Bekah: Yeah.

421
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,163
Helen: Thanks.

422
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:20,907
Bekah: Like I remember when I was
coming into tech a couple of

423
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,988
years ago, we didn't have much
money. I've got four kids. And

424
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:30,327
somebody said, Hey, like, meet
you at Starbucks a half an hour

425
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:33,327
away. And like, for me, it was
that same thing. Like I had to go

426
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:37,678
through my head and think about
like, there's there's money.

427
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,587
There's a cost to drive there.
There's I had a Starbucks card.

428
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:42,478
So I was like, I can use my
Starbucks card. I don't have to

429
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:46,347
worry about that. But like, even
that little bit of gas money

430
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:51,522
there. Required me to think about
like, am I investing in? And, and

431
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:55,482
ultimately, like I was investing
in myself and retrospectively, I

432
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:56,623
can see that, like, this

433
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:57,188
Helen: Yeah.

434
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,313
Bekah: being able to meet
somebody because that led me to

435
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:04,242
the support system that got me
through learning how to code, but

436
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:04,798
Helen: Yeah.

437
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:06,492
Bekah: hard in that moment

438
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:06,768
Helen: Yeah.

439
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,182
Bekah: to think like, okay, you
know, there's money that I can

440
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:13,542
spend here is that money worth
it? And like right. Nothing is

441
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:18,607
guaranteed there. But, you know,
think about what the long-term

442
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:23,617
investment is and, and where that
can take you. It's hard.

443
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:26,998
Helen: Yeah. I Al I always share
this with people. I was like, the

444
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,758
struggle is, well, I'm not going
to even try to downplay that

445
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:34,258
soccer. The struggles will, but
even when you, when there's no

446
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:37,978
guarantees and there's a high
probability that you will lose,

447
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,928
quote, unquote, lose whatever,
try to have a backup Like if you

448
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:46,498
can obtain the thing that you're
get, what else can help you

449
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:49,167
support you to get you closer to
the thing you're trying to get?

450
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:54,327
Right. So, Um, so a lot of times
meeting up with these people,

451
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:59,008
like, cause you have to eat
there. Time is money. have to be

452
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,238
very cautious on your time You
know, you got to make sure you're

453
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:08,968
leveraging your skills and your
time appropriately, but you also

454
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:12,928
want to make sure that you get
something out of it where you

455
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:17,847
can, um, that were be beneficial,
not to be sounds or selfish, but

456
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:24,347
also, but still get the support.
Right. So, so a lot of times when

457
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:30,198
I meet people and w I learned to
not accept a meeting or do a

458
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:35,597
meeting where there no agenda,
was no goal. I had to that out. I

459
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:38,208
wasn't with, for the longest
time, I was wait for them to

460
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,208
figure out the agenda, but like,
no, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no,

461
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:43,667
no. figure out what you need. A
lot of times people have not even

462
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,337
take the moment to figure out
what they need and what they

463
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:52,407
want. Um, unfortunately people
will wait until they hit a Crow

464
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:58,347
crossroad. generally when some
type of life transition or crap

465
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:03,117
happened to you, which was sucks.
it's better to use your make,

466
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,357
take a Saturday and a month. And
you use those times to have those

467
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:10,647
life choice, moments, get some
coffee or tea and brunch, you

468
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,228
know, and just figure out and,
and journal and just write some

469
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,258
stuff down or even using no pat
on your phone. If you don't want

470
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:21,117
to write. Oh, a voice and just
trust are asking those small

471
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:25,407
questions like questions, you
know, like having a little Oprah

472
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:30,117
was that, so Sunday we'll have
your own soul Sunday and figured

473
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:32,968
this stuff out if you don't
figure that out, trust me,

474
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,678
somebody's going to figure it out
for you. So.

475
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,347
Bekah: I love that because it is,
you know, if you're, if you're

476
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:43,887
not doing that consistently or
not taking that time out, then,

477
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,768
then it just like keeps coming.
Right. It

478
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,458
Helen: Yeah.

479
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:50,637
Bekah: it never stops because
there will continually be asks of

480
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:54,208
you or things that you need to
figure out for yourself. So if

481
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,357
you know, like this is what I'm
going to figure it out, then it

482
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:01,228
feels less overwhelming the other
three weeks or, you know, other

483
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,317
six days of the week, however you
decide to plan it. So

484
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:04,528
Helen: Yeah.

485
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:09,772
Bekah: that. I know I'm going to
make decisions on this day and

486
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,972
then you can do that without
having to worry. Hopefully.

487
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,083
Helen: Have you ever, I'm not
sure if it's me, but I have

488
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,682
noticed for my, in my own
personal life, that lessons that

489
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:25,633
you thought you had. We'll
revisit your revisit you to try

490
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:31,002
you out. It's like if it's like,
w like, walk up today and chose

491
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:34,813
violence was going to let know
what thing you thought you, you

492
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:41,442
learned. Let's try it again, you
know? So it just come in a

493
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,282
different form.

494
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:45,317
Bekah: it's like, oh yeah. I said
that I had mastered this thing.

495
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:50,627
And then it's like, you, uh, no,
no, I didn't. I didn't master

496
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:51,077
anything.

497
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:51,857
Helen: Yeah.

498
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,583
Dan: Uh, man. Yep. No, that's,
that's interesting though,

499
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,982
because that sort of thing is
like, you know, you can process

500
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:07,482
something after and identify
where made a mistake or what you

501
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:10,212
could do different, but you
probably made those mistakes or

502
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:14,563
did things that maybe weren't
good the moment because the.

503
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,653
Well, how you think when you're
stressed is different than how

504
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:18,883
you think when you're relaxed,
right? How you

505
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:19,208
Helen: Yeah.

506
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,702
Dan: you're upset is different
than how you think when you're

507
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:22,482
happy. Right.

508
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:23,298
Helen: Yeah.

509
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:27,522
Dan: think that can go along,
like, uh, back to your or your

510
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:32,413
idea of having a plan like that.
And, um, if you have something

511
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:36,732
like that to fall back on a goal
or a whatever, or, you know,

512
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:40,393
these lessons that you've
learned, but, um, when things are

513
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:45,208
bad, you know, how. Thinking.
Okay. Does this help my further,

514
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,758
my goal, you know, instead of
just reacting, know, just

515
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:52,228
reacting to, as, as it comes, you
know, like it's kind of all ties

516
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,758
in together is really cool.

517
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,333
Helen: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

518
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:56,397
Dan: really good way to be.

519
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,423
Bekah: Yeah. So this ties back
into like the things that you've

520
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,643
been doing. Cause you're doing a
lot of like really great things

521
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:05,333
to help people. And you've got
this, um, state of developers and

522
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:10,432
you've got Right. And so, do you
want to introduce what those

523
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,982
things are to our listeners? And
then we'll kind of talk about

524
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:14,752
like how you're supporting people
through this.

525
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:20,508
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. for
bringing it up. Um, so, uh, state

526
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:26,417
of developers is a, um, industry
survey that I launch right before

527
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:31,397
Christmas, where I'm trying to
survey developers, um, on burnout

528
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:37,792
and their experience burnout,
anxiety, and depression. Um, So

529
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,292
it's, I'm asking it's premium
Lutz, a holistic view on it

530
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:46,163
because I realized that, you
know, when you're at work, you

531
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:50,242
bring your whole self to work.
Um, so whatever, all the crap you

532
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:54,133
had to deal with at home that
comes to work with you, AI it

533
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:58,282
carpools with you. Um, and
whatever happens at work carpools

534
00:33:58,313 --> 00:33:58,583
with you.

535
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,232
Bekah: take the carpool lane then

536
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:06,863
Helen: And you could try, you
could try. I think the PoPo gonna

537
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:16,163
be like, ah, uh, so yeah, I, I,
cause I noticed that, um, there

538
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:20,782
was something I struggled with a
lot and I noticed that it wasn't

539
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:25,793
a very high priority in business
world. You know? Um, this is

540
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:32,188
always falls under the. The
wellness, whatever will, we time

541
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:36,538
doing, doing, dowel months. We
can focus on that, you know, but

542
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:41,637
we have to focus on these OKR as
our objectives or KPIs or key

543
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:47,907
performance indicators, whatever.
Um, and I, and I, I always won't

544
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:52,722
allow myself to focus too much on
it because. Like I wanted to

545
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:58,032
create a product or app to help
me with this, but because I knew

546
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,943
it wasn't high priority, busy in
a business world, I was like,

547
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:03,222
that's another way for me to be
broke. And Helen, you already

548
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:08,472
have bad ideas. I never allow
myself, but I started noticing

549
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:15,733
that I was like, if I'm burnout
and I had some, some dark

550
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:20,188
moments. I know someone else has
some dark moments. I know if

551
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:25,737
somebody else is struggling with
coding and like, and trying to

552
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:31,918
balance life, life, me, my
current, um, life situation, I'm

553
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:38,097
trying to, uh, come up from
shutting down a startup, trying

554
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:42,088
to reenter the market, you know,
trying to learn some new skills

555
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:45,117
on top of that. I got an elderly
paradigm helping cold characters.

556
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:50,527
You know, um, all of that is a
lot of stress. I'm not going to

557
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:53,648
be talking about trying to do
chores. John, trying to do the

558
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:58,538
job, honey that's in itself is a
whole day's work and that, so I

559
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:04,777
have less several full-time jobs
throughout throughout the day. So

560
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,268
was like, if I'm struggling, you
had to be somebody else

561
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:13,088
struggling. And, and this is too
important to keep pushing as a

562
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,543
low priority. You know, this guy,
the impact, the bottom line

563
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:22,213
somehow, you know, and I start, I
start, Um, asking developers and

564
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,213
tech founders for any of those.
Dan was one of them. So he

565
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:28,393
gracefully didn't want with me
and just ask him a series of

566
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:32,532
questions. And then, and the, the
mother stuff people was telling

567
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:36,463
me, I was like, oh shit, this is
something okay. We need to get

568
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,463
math numbers for people to
realize, no, this is something

569
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:44,577
serious. Okay. You think. This is
not important. Like there's one

570
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:49,077
insight. I don't want to quite
share yet that across the board,

571
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:53,217
depending on the developer and
the amount of privilege they

572
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:57,268
have, I was like in managers knew
they was making they decisions

573
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,068
like this. were freaked

574
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:00,498
Bekah: Yeah.

575
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:08,052
Helen: Right. And I saw, I did
like last I. Or damn some energy

576
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:11,862
engineer managers. And I asked
them, I didn't out, nobody. I

577
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:17,592
just say, have you lost because
of this reason, age one, I'm

578
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:24,702
saying, no, no, no, no, no. I'm
like really Cause I, I changed

579
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,742
the way I questioned that. I
said, Hey, have you lost talent

580
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:31,242
because of this reason. Um, and
if not, and if not, tell me your

581
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:36,012
secret and people would just
start us blaming their way. Being

582
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:39,193
mindful and having their own
wellness programs and stuff like

583
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:42,012
that. And then there's some that
some men are just like, well, I'm

584
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:47,202
not sure, but this is how my
people are struggling. Or this is

585
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,902
how I'm trying to prevent my
people from struggling. And they

586
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:56,282
even know that it's the workload,
but like one per one managers,

587
00:37:56,322 --> 00:38:00,373
like, like he said, if I didn't
have the authority to push back,

588
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:06,568
I would even quit. That's his
whole. That's this whole guy, the

589
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:11,998
jail free card, his bike is the
push mat kind of thing. So, Yeah.

590
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:15,088
So, so that's what state of the
developer is. It's just, it's a

591
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:21,088
holistic survey. I'm trying to, I
have to, um, have them been

592
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:25,347
promoting it this month because
I'm trying to shorten it. I've

593
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:28,228
been, that's the number one
feedback I get from the

594
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:29,157
developers in the last.

595
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:30,507
Bekah: Yeah.

596
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:34,543
Helen: right now, I'm just trying
to, I'm trying to get con um,

597
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,112
condense it, you know, Mert some
of the questions and stuff like

598
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:42,583
that and make it simpler. Uh, so,
but I'm going to relaunch it, um,

599
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:47,623
um, March and try to get more
people to, um, fill it. Um, and

600
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:52,452
I, hopefully I can be with a,
share the resorts results in, um,

601
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:55,452
this summer, because the goal
was, I just didn't want to just.

602
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,353
Do a survey and we say, Yeah.
everybody's up because we are

603
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:05,862
tired and we broke and we tired.
We mentally broke. We just, so,

604
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:08,742
you know, that's why you got
these crappy products, you know,

605
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:13,032
but I wanted to also provide,
like, some of the questions is

606
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:16,362
asking people how they cope, how
did they deal with, how did they

607
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:22,137
help diddly manage it? You know,
kind of thing. So. Um, compile a

608
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:25,827
list of resources so people can
try the south. Cause this one,

609
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:26,938
the thing about burnout,

610
00:39:27,182 --> 00:39:27,342
Bekah: Yup.

611
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:31,498
Helen: many factors contribute to
it and, and it's just like

612
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:36,958
productivity, um, is it's it's
not like one, it's not a one

613
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:42,507
solution is really up to the
person what's in the context of

614
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:47,922
their life. Are there variables
they have to deal with? So. So

615
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,563
that's where instead of
developers. Sorry, ask that now.

616
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:51,282
So go ahead.

617
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:54,733
Dan: no, not at all. I think it's
great. I think it's, I think it's

618
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,603
very cool. And I, I think maybe
walk into this, but the Jovial

619
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:04,407
is, it is sort of. About framing
it, not for like the individual.

620
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,617
Right. But for the company who
has developers as employees.

621
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:07,978
Right.

622
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:08,773
Helen: Yeah.

623
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:14,188
Dan: how to this is, this is like
the. This is one of the parts

624
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:17,728
that's like re very interesting
to me, right. Is, is like that

625
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:21,597
turning Cause cause company, most
companies don't like hire

626
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:24,358
developers and say, I'm going to
burn these people out. Right. You

627
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:28,617
know? so they don't like, uh,
that it's probably, don't realize

628
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:32,668
it, you know, or don't mean to.
so, uh, I was just wondering, you

629
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,588
know, what, like what are ways
after it, you know, after

630
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:42,543
information all of developers is,
uh, if you. Are thinking more as

631
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,552
a manager or something like that.
Like what are, what are like some

632
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:47,612
ways to support your developers
and, and like watch for stuff

633
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,103
like this and prevent it from
happening, things like

634
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:55,077
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. So, So. just,
just for disclaimer. Shelby has

635
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,668
gone through like his own, um,
evolution kind of thing. Um,

636
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:04,648
because the, solution that I was
trying to propose as to solving

637
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:07,858
this problem, didn't pan out,
right? That's one thing about

638
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:12,507
startup world. So I wasn't sold
on, I'm not married to that

639
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:15,958
solution. married to trying to
figure out how hell then don't

640
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:21,898
be. This time next year, That's
what I'm sold on too. So, um,

641
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:26,998
right now Jovial is the whole
goal is definitely is more, um,

642
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:32,818
helping teams, um, to manage the
burnout. Um, and it's, it's not

643
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:37,438
just also just identifying
signals, but I'm thinking of more

644
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:44,518
of Craney a developer tool where,
um, it allows both parties the,

645
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:51,012
before. Right about the issue.
And that's really meaning being

646
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:55,123
transparent about different
things about your own goals.

647
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:58,483
Because a lot of times people
won't say something because you

648
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:01,543
know, that might go against
company policy, or they might,

649
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:05,503
that might that developer, the
manager might not want to tell

650
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,262
the developer does the developer
just want to call and he, the

651
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:11,503
manager might need him to step up
or her to step up and take a

652
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:14,472
leadership role is it's just
like, like how Can we help each

653
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:19,168
other along. Our goals and help
help each other instead of

654
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:25,108
sabotage each other's success
kind of thing. So, um, right now

655
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:29,188
Jovial is looking like, um, while
I'm trying to, I guess this is my

656
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:35,038
first time me just sharing it and
trying to, um, see if giving, um,

657
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:42,327
developers like an NPS tool, kind
of like an NPS score, like on on

658
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,637
like how, like, when.

659
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,978
Bekah: you pause for a second?
What is NPS? I'm sorry, I don't

660
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:51,427
Helen: So I, so NPS is like a net
promoter score. You usually, get

661
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,248
them as a customer, like, let's
say you bought, like, I bought

662
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:56,858
KFC the other day and I on my
receipt. You go to the website,

663
00:42:56,918 --> 00:43:01,347
they was like, how likely are you
to. How buyers buy this chicken

664
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:04,858
sandwich is again, how do I get
for employees? They normally get

665
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:08,577
NPS score that say, how lucky are
you to invite your developer

666
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:13,887
buddies to platform job here.
trying to gauge how much and how

667
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:19,197
much you don't kind of thing with
whoever you're working with. So

668
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:22,858
mostly it's like, it's like, why
don't we have an MPS score on

669
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:29,998
just really gauge how much. This
task or how much this woke is,

670
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:30,262
Bekah: Yeah.

671
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,628
Helen: impacting you and also
impacting the company. Because

672
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:35,818
one of the things I've learned
through the survey is that a lot

673
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:40,378
of developers don't know if
they're making an impact. I was

674
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,987
like, how do you measure your
progress? How do you measure your

675
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,987
impact daily? Even know if they,
they make, have an impact, they

676
00:43:45,987 --> 00:43:49,077
only have, like most of the
developers don't even have

677
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:54,967
metrics. They to judge. Or
they're worth, not even

678
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:55,463
Bekah: Yeah.

679
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:59,257
Helen: goals or metrics for
themselves, from the company.

680
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:04,208
Right. it's just more of like
right now, I'm just, I'm

681
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:08,318
researching it and I'm trying to
figure out how can help

682
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:15,188
developers to really, um,
measure, uh, what they done and

683
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:19,918
measure. Um, Like the
conversation, like, did they get

684
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:23,697
the feedback or the support that
they need? Um, cause one thing

685
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:28,318
when I did, I did like a
self-assessment, last week on my

686
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,047
own personal experience with
burnout. And once I realized

687
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:35,487
that. my main problem was I
wouldn't speak up about my own

688
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:39,838
needs and concerns. Like I would
suffer through like the whole

689
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,288
month of February. was me
suffering through trying to

690
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:48,722
relearn something. And learn a
new technology, whatever try to.

691
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:53,853
I got past a technical interview,
but I didn't tell my family, I

692
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:59,103
even had the interview because I
didn't want them to feel anxious

693
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:01,802
about it because we were kind of
going through some stuff

694
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:06,663
financially. And I didn't want
that burden of pressure. Just in

695
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:09,422
case I don't get the interview
and which happened, I didn't get

696
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:14,353
the third interview. Right. So I
kept this to myself. So. But I

697
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:18,043
have an elegant parent and she's
waking up early. So she started

698
00:45:18,103 --> 00:45:21,702
kind of like interfere little bit
on my time when I was using to

699
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:25,302
study. that made me wake up three
hours earlier. So that's. like,

700
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:28,242
I'm up five in the morning, you
know, trying to do this stuff,

701
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:33,733
but could have like really saved
myself some of this agony, if I

702
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:37,422
just shared this information
where my family says, Hey, I got

703
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:42,193
this really hard thing I'm trying
to do. why little. And that is, I

704
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:45,972
didn't want share because I
didn't want to disappoint. And

705
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:49,543
also it was just hard because I'm
still learning, trying to figure

706
00:45:49,543 --> 00:45:54,483
out the language. use with my
family to describe what the hell

707
00:45:54,512 --> 00:46:04,262
I do for a living. Like, I, I
can't figure it out. Every word

708
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:08,972
it's just like, you know, the
Charlie brown, um, TV show, the

709
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:11,762
parents. I was like, mama. Why,
why, why watch? That's how

710
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:18,362
family. Why, why, why, why? So,
yeah, so that's where I'm at. I'm

711
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:22,572
looking at. Like really like
trying to figure out a way where

712
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:27,132
people can be transparent and
just open in their communication,

713
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:31,483
you know? So I thought the best
way is just really just the

714
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:35,023
score. It score it for yourself.
And if you willing, you can share

715
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:40,963
next person, but at least help
you break down and identify and

716
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:44,922
pinpoint some issues. So you can
bring it up to the right place.

717
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:50,498
So, I'm not sure if I confuse you
or not. I'm still learning.

718
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:56,353
Bekah: We're also like, for so
important because those

719
00:46:56,353 --> 00:47:00,972
conversations are super hard to
initiate and to talk about. And

720
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,722
last week, and one of my Virtual
Coffee breakout rooms, we talked

721
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:09,222
about, um, like what have you
taken from a past experience?

722
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:13,213
That was good, but you know, your
new work experience. And for me,

723
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:19,487
that was like, A really important
topic because I I've been very

724
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:24,077
transparent about I'm going
through. And I've talked about

725
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:29,208
the PTSD that I've my life and
Tasha, like the last four months.

726
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:32,458
Well, it's like clockwork, like
every two weeks, here's something

727
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,757
new to trigger you. Like not
stopping now. I'm like, I don't

728
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:41,788
know, right before this call, I
got a call about my mom had heart

729
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:47,652
problems and a procedure and
stuff and it was like, You know,

730
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:52,032
like what do you do in those
situations? And for me, because

731
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:57,313
of my past experience, I'm like
able go to boss now and say like,

732
00:47:57,313 --> 00:48:01,512
Hey, listen, this is what's going
on in my life. I'm to try but I'm

733
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,163
canceling my meetings for today

734
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:03,672
Helen: Yeah.

735
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:10,797
Bekah: that's going to be okay.
But like, I don't know that know

736
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:14,157
for sure that there out there
that would not feel confident

737
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,018
doing that thing. Right.

738
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:16,657
Helen: Yeah.

739
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:21,898
Bekah: and so if you, if you have
something that that open

740
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,617
conversation, like I am all for
that, because the more that we

741
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:30,387
can like we can, we can be
transparent with each. Well,

742
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:34,677
exactly. I love so much what you
said about like, you bring all of

743
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:39,117
your experience to table and
that's been my. Talk for the last

744
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:42,177
year I've been talking about the
person centered approach to tech.

745
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,507
It's like, we're not, we're not
developers, we're human beings.

746
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:49,077
And have we have
responsibilities, we have these

747
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:53,367
things outside of tech and that
comes, that comes with us. it, if

748
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,978
people don't acknowledge that,
then you're setting us up for

749
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:01,632
failure. And so I just really
love that idea that. Working on

750
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:08,322
helping to support the issues of
the whole people, the whole

751
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,302
person that comes to your team.

752
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,737
Helen: Yeah, Yeah, exactly is.
And it helps the managers too.

753
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:18,547
Like I'm not a manager, but,
well, I am because as a startup

754
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,217
founder, I had learn how to
manage three people and the man

755
00:49:21,217 --> 00:49:26,172
is the developer. And the men,
that's the founder Hela and add

756
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,583
the man has done invest in Helen
because she was pissed off

757
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:31,123
because she wasn't getting her
money back. So that was a whole

758
00:49:31,123 --> 00:49:36,552
nother management style I had to
learn. Um, but I think at the end

759
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:39,943
of the day, we're just trying to
reduce the amount of risk we're

760
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:46,092
trying to make the worst case
scenario, the less worse, you

761
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:49,572
know, if it happens, it's like,
it's just like, I guess that's

762
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:53,248
why I'm looking at. Cause I think
one thing about burnout. Um, and

763
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:56,608
the issue is about tackling it
and trying to get support around

764
00:49:56,637 --> 00:50:00,418
tagging them. It is because
people was, is like, awesome.

765
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:05,577
Nice to have the tack tackle it.
NOLA is nice. Just like it's,

766
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:10,648
it's, like it's worst case
scenario. It is the Murphy's law.

767
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:11,132
Bekah: Yeah.

768
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:15,027
Helen: You know what I'm saying?
So, but for me personally, I

769
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:19,318
even, I had to get, buy in to
tackle it because I always pushed

770
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:22,617
it to the side because it, to me,
there was always something more

771
00:50:22,737 --> 00:50:28,827
poor and more grants bigger I had
to go fight and save kind of

772
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,677
thing. But at the same time it
was making life worse. Right. So

773
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:39,838
it's like, if you want life to be
a little bit easier, go tackle

774
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,797
some of those demons. I'm telling
you be a ghost Buster, figured it

775
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:43,887
out.

776
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:52,565
Bekah: It's valuable, super
valuable advice. Cause I think

777
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:56,826
that, you know, we always want to
do is do things in detriment of

778
00:50:56,826 --> 00:51:02,795
ourselves. Like, everybody else
going forward. And we, we don't

779
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:07,300
take care of like what we need.
And it's a thing. Somebody told

780
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,541
me somebody DME, and they were
like, you're the one that said

781
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:13,811
you should put the oxygen mask on
first. So why don't you do it?

782
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:19,300
I'm like, I I should do the
things that I say

783
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,641
Helen: Yeah, no practice. What
you preach is so hard to do.

784
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:27,291
Yeah. It's just like, cause at
the end of the day, we trying to

785
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:33,740
manage things, you know? Um, and
we dealing with re reaction. So

786
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,420
when you don't say nothing. And
you do something, people going to

787
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,471
react. Like I will, the reason I
was waking up early, because I

788
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:47,740
just found like, this is the
quiet as my house is it is once,

789
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:53,800
once one person up everybody's
up, you know? So my mom saw that

790
00:51:54,130 --> 00:52:01,050
and she was like, okay, I'm gonna
wake up with, you know, I need, I

791
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,831
love you, but no,

792
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:05,081
Bekah: Yes. I feel, I feel that
hardcore, my

793
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:05,565
Helen: Yeah.

794
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,360
Bekah: you wake me up at five?
No,

795
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:16,016
Helen: you know, so it's, so as a
manager is like, if you're trying

796
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:21,686
to support your team, trying to
China, manage stakeholders and

797
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:26,096
stuff like that, you, your worst
enemy, your nemesis is that

798
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:33,266
unknown variable. Right? So why
don't you. The so easy and

799
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:37,436
comfortable for people to be
open, you know? Yes. He might

800
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:41,005
hear something. He might not lie,
but even if let's say, let's say

801
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:44,485
you hear a developer, he's have M
they're ambitious and they want

802
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,826
to have they own startups. And
you know, there are way to

803
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:50,246
thinking one foot out the door.
Don't think that way. Okay. What

804
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:53,126
can you align? What kind of
projects can you align with them?

805
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:57,056
You know, to help them with their
go, but also help the company

806
00:52:57,056 --> 00:53:02,306
reach their goals. You know,
granted you got competitive NDAs,

807
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:04,916
all that stuff. I get that. Yeah.
Don't, developer's going to be an

808
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:10,706
ad in that Sesame street. Don't
be, don't be mean bad and naughty

809
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:15,925
go against your company, you
know, you know, you know, just

810
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:19,945
try to align goals, like, like
I'm ambitious too, but I'm also

811
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:25,016
looking for a job, but I said,
okay, Don't apply for any job

812
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:31,226
that, that kind of like into your
competition world. know, flat for

813
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:37,240
jobs you will want company to be
your. So your last dead there,

814
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,871
you're, we're selling branding
our new relationship, right. Kind

815
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:44,081
of thing, where you want to
invest in those relationships at

816
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:47,501
that company. So you don't want
to screw over people or burn

817
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:51,190
bridges. You trying to have
strong ties. You're trying to

818
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:55,481
make sure that people hit goals
because at the end of the day,

819
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:58,751
get chance to hit yo goals. So
looking at it like that. So a lot

820
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:02,110
of times I really encourage
managers and both the talent to

821
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:09,701
look at in that way. At it more
mutual benefiting because every

822
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:12,791
relationship have is lifecycle.
Just like every product have is

823
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:18,221
life cycle, development have his
life cycle. So of us like it's

824
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:25,481
not there, just being more, um,
uh, um, be, just be more, um, uh,

825
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,481
intense, uh, thoughtful,
thoughtful,

826
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,471
Dan: I love that. I like, I
really like the framing of, you

827
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,070
know, aligning goals, um, for,
for this sort of thing. So it's

828
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,846
not like it gives you a good, uh,
Tool to conversation, you know,

829
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,905
starter, you know what I mean? So
if you go into your manager or

830
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:47,065
whatever, and you want to talk
about this, you don't just have

831
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:51,985
to say I'm tired or whatever, you
know, I have too much work or

832
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:55,436
whatever, like saying let's have
a conversation where we like work

833
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:59,576
together and align our goals
together. I think that it's, it's

834
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,525
just, like you said, mutually
beneficial. I think that's, I

835
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:02,365
think that's great advice.

836
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,001
Helen: Yeah. Cause I talked to my
manager last week and it was

837
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:09,650
like, yeah, I had one person. Um,
last one because they were so

838
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,201
tired, they was like, but they
also had another start-up and

839
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:16,581
they didn't tell nobody about it.
And also my, how can I help you?

840
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,380
You know? that's all on that
person a little bit. You're

841
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,751
right. So, you know,

842
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,800
Bekah: Well, I think like back to
what you were saying about

843
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,081
acknowledging people where
they're at, like there are

844
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:33,740
companies that make you afraid to
be doing your own projects or

845
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,161
like want to claim your own
projects, right? Like, no I've

846
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:39,981
been doing this thing on my own
time. Like this does not belong

847
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:43,940
to you. And so having that
transparency and that clarity is

848
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,280
super important making sure that
everybody succeeds, not just, you

849
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,400
know, the company or the person,
like everybody succeeds when

850
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,760
you're trans.

851
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:57,351
Helen: Yeah, you got to remember,
companies are just like people. I

852
00:55:57,351 --> 00:56:00,440
mean, you got mean people, you
got nice people, you got good

853
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:06,260
people. You got, you know how
Holly that I, people you get all

854
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,420
sorts of kinds of people and you
got that with companies. So if

855
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,820
you decide to go with a company,
you know, they're very strict

856
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:18,110
about that. You're making the
decision be like, okay, I gotta

857
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:23,365
be in the closet. Um, I go and I
can't wait my flag and be proud

858
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:26,065
about this, you know, kind of
thing. You, you make those

859
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:29,755
choices, right. you could find
companies where, and you can do

860
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:34,615
your own, um, D uh, diligent
research and see, do they have

861
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,606
entrepreneurial people? Is there
anybody that work here and also

862
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:42,356
have their own side project or
they own start up and they are,

863
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:45,626
they open about it? Do they have
in their bio? I'm a founder of

864
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:52,286
this and. Or do they just say, I
work at enterprise company, you

865
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:56,126
know what I'm saying? They had
this incognito kind of phrases.

866
00:56:56,755 --> 00:57:00,896
So well, my views are not my own.
I seen so many of those in the

867
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:05,876
engineering manager, Twitter,
Twitter, bio. I'm like, wow. You

868
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:09,295
know, there's some companies like
that, you know, you know, so you

869
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:13,226
know, your own personality, you
know, what kind of, um, you know,

870
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:19,541
whether you're. You know, whether
a company profile is going to

871
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,981
have you, um, filling out some
kind of facade or just living

872
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:28,601
your own life, living your own
truth. So some companies I know

873
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:31,721
I'll have to put on a facade. If
I say I have to, right. My views

874
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:37,360
are my own. I know I'm screwed,
you know?

875
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,550
Bekah: I feel that 100%. And I
just want to say, thank you so

882
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,445
fear. do not bore these

883
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,311
Bekah: I don't know. I don't feel
like you could ever bore anyone.

00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:03,786
Dan: no,

885
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,650

Dan: I had talked to you in the
past. I was not worried about
