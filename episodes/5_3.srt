00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:51,380
on slack and side. Uh, Uh, come
on. That's not how I live my

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,990
life, I live my life, one
distraction at a time. Anyway,

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
um, today we have a great
episode. We talked with Helen

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,485
Griffin, who is a full-stack
developer and a founder. And,

21
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,870
um,

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,324
yeah, we talked about her
journey through tech and, um,

23
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:09,718
talked a

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,434
lot about her experience as a
founder of her two companies.

25
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,149
Um,

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,150
Uh, State of Developers and
Jovial. And so those two

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,370
companies concentrate a lot on,
um, developer, personal health

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,590
of

29
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,700
developers and that things like
burnout and stuff like that. Um,

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,420
so it was really interesting.

31
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,079
Bekah: Yeah, I love talking to
Helen. She's a lot of fun and I

32
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,650
love the idea that she's a
multi-passionate person. She's

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,829
got all of these things that
she's doing. She's excited to

34
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,769
talk about them and to share
what she's doing. And there's so

35
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,079
many

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,984
great moments. This episode,
there was one moment. I can't

37
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,215
remember which one it was, but I
was like taking a sip of coffee

38
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,034
and Helen said something. I
choked, literally choked on my

39
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,215
coffee because I was laughing.
And then it took me a solid

40
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:04,295
couple of minutes to get past
that. But, uh, she was a lot of

41
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,015
fun to have.

42
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,199
Dan: Yeah, no, I had to actually
block your video screen from

43
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,849
like

44
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,529
looking at it so that we didn't
just have a total meltdown in

45
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,179
the

46
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,829
middle of the episode, but, uh,
no, it was fine. We laughed a

47
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,478
lot

48
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,050
and, um, Helen was great. Uh, so
yeah, it was a, it was a good

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,330
episode and, uh, I think you're
going to enjoy it.

50
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,562
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

51
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,443
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

52
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:29,467
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We

53
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,491
hope

54
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:42,661
you enjoy this episode. Today's
random question is what is one

55
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,691
thing you would like to learn
more about, but have no reason

56
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:53,640
to? So my name is Bekah I am a
technical community builder from

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,760
a small town in Ohio. And one
thing I would like to learn more

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,150
about, I don't know, it's
either, um, like trees or birds.

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,480
They're

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,037
both like very fascinating. What
is the eye roll there Dan?

61
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,381
Dan: You stole mine! That's
exactly what I was going to say.

62
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,251
Bekah: I get to go first. So now
you need to think of something

63
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:20,098
else. there's there's a website
that has, like, people can

64
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,945
submit

65
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:27,955
sounds of birds and where they
are hearing those sounds. So

66
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:29,455
there's recording of that and
I'm like, there there's, there's

67
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,955
a

68
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:35,545
really cool project here, have
not, not figured it out yet. So.

69
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,755
Dan: Um, oh, well, hi, I'm Dan.
I do web development in

70
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,275
Cleveland,

71
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,885
Ohio, and yeah, man, I was going
to do, I like knowing about

72
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,840
things that I see, you know,
it's like, There's like, it's

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,795
just

74
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,475
like really cool to be able to
like, look at things and know

75
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:59,836
what they are. Right. It's, it's
a strange thing that to say out

76
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:01,681
loud, I guess. But, um, you
know, since Bekah stole the,

77
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,526
that one

78
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:06,675
from me, I I'll go like, you
know, architecture or something

79
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,010
like that, you know, being able
to like wander around a city

80
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,345
and,

81
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:15,116
you know, be like, oh, you know,
Thomas Jefferson was drinking

82
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:20,971
something, I don't know,
something like that. Yeah. uh,

83
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,680
that's going to be that's my
second place answer,

84
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:25,505
Helen: Okay. Okay. Um, all
right. That leaves me. What's

85
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,919
up. Y'all

86
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm Helen. Um, I am a full stack
developer. I'm from Midwest. Um,

87
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:38,420
howdy. I think to answer that
question, I think I would like

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,809
to

89
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,930
learn about some form of martial
art. I have no reason.

90
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,130
Dan: a good one

91
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,211
Bekah: Really good one.

92
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,970
Helen: But I would still like to
learn. Some form of martial

93
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,369
know.

94
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,080
It would be Jiu Ji... Jiu Jitsu
I can never pronounce it. So

95
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,790
that's

96
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,391
probably something I won't learn
since I can't pronounce it. So I

97
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:07,651
just stay with karate since I
could pronounce that. Um, don't

98
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:10,470
know want to learn it because
I'm not flexible. I know. That's

99
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,289
it

100
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,391
while I work, I don't even stand
it. So I breath hard going

101
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,701
upstairs. So we see how that
works out.

102
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,600
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
feel

103
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,021
Helen: Yeah.

104
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,971
Bekah: been my first answer now
that you said that I'm like,

105
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:30,261
yeah, Brazilian, Jiu Jitsu.

106
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:33,136
Helen: I just want to, I guess,
growing up, I used to watch

107
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,490
movies, 80 movies, so they
always have some kind of karate

108
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,365
scene. I

109
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,646
don't care, wherever the fight
scene, it always turned into a

110
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:43,516
karate scene I'm like, how are
you from Chicago? Are you start

111
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:47,415
karate? I don't... make it make
sense.

112
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:51,495
Bekah: Okay, so this is great.
My brother, my older brothers, I

113
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,890
have two brothers, an older one,
a younger one. When in that,

114
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,285
that

115
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:59,625
nineties era of karate fighting
scenes, used to love them and

116
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,636
like, especially Chuck Norris
movies. And so

117
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,250
Helen: Yeah.

118
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:06,706
Bekah: them on the VCR and then
like play them in like slow and

119
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:11,776
mimic the action so he could
learn I sit there and watch him

120
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:12,766
the thing.

121
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:13,511
Helen: Yes.

122
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,271
Bekah: 100% feel you on

123
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,091
Helen: my goodness. Yes, I,
yeah. I, all of the movies,

124
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,161
there was

125
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,170
some karate. What's dude that
use to be in Dirty Dancing,

126
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,151
blonde-haried guy. He passed
little while back.

127
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:25,701
Bekah: Patrick Swayze.

128
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,046
Helen: He had a Roadhouse that
movie, a lot of karate, how

129
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:30,391

to break out into a song.

137
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:55,245
Bekah: Oh, my gosh. is so
amazing. I'm so glad that this

138
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:59,055
was the random intro question,
but I very much appreciate this.

139
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:04,516
Thanks Helen, for being here
with us today. Um,

140
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,505
Helen: I don't got nothing else
to do so. appreciate it.

141
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,930
Bekah: All right, get into your
story. We like to get the story

142
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,975
everyone that comes the podcast.
So what has led you where you

143
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:20,629
are

144
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,201
today?

145
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:27,446
Helen: Okay. Um, it started off
on is snowy winter night in

146
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:32,516
April. What I was, I thought, I
don't know. I don't know when.

147
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,971
Bekah: We're getting the birth
stories this season. This is

148
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,461
great special episode.

149
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:46,055
Helen: no, no. You know, my pop
pop raised me up to the sky she

150
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:52,175
said she has borns and no, no,
no, no. For real, I guess, I

151
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:54,035
guess to make it, to answer your
question, I started off my

152
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,775
career

153
00:07:55,805 --> 00:08:00,000
as a front end developer. Um, or
a web developer at the time, I

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,521
didn't even know the difference
between front end and back end

155
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,605
back at the time. So I started
as a web developer and got my

156
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,689
first

157
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,331
corporate gig, um, um, at
American greetings. Um, so that

158
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:15,076
was, that was my first corporate
gig. Um, and then sells front

159
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,821
end

160
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,160
developer for quite some times.
So a good 10 years. And then,

161
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,499
um,

162
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,515
I took, I decided to. Start a
startup. So I, for the past

163
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:28,499
seven

164
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,000
years I've been doing a startup,
uh, or several startups or just,

165
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:36,165
but, uh, I guess most of that
time, what people don't tell

166
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,759
you,

167
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:42,811
like when you launch a startup,
uh, you startup before. I never

168
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:47,280
worked in startup before. What
that is is it's equivalent to a.

169
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:51,586
Um, it's just an MBA program
that you don't get at the end of

170
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:54,706
it.

171
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:58,673
You don't get no certification,
no degree. Um, and you spend

172
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:02,640
your

173
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,081
own money similar to like an MBA
program. You spend your own

174
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:12,030
money, uh, and the tuition
always goes up. So, yeah. so

175
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,979
that's,

176
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,620
that's pretty much was my, the
story. I was a front end

177
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,225
developer. Um, now I say I'm a
full stack developer just based

178
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:28,905
on my experience, you know, just
have to learn as a, founder, you

179
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,355
have to make things work No.
matter what it's all up to you.

180
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,535
So you don't have another
department or another colleague

181
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:39,885
go and say, Hey, make this word,
do your fancy. woo woo You know,

182
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,593
you had to go learn it. So I
kinda like that. Um, a little

183
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,301
bit

184
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:47,071
of backend stuff like that, and
that does gain some business

185
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:52,350
acumen well. um, I think the
last, last seven years has been

186
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,551
less development, the more
business development and just

187
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,951
learning the business world and
that's his own ecosystem. So

188
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,255
yeah. So now that I'm kind of.
And I don't want to say stepping

189
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:10,336
away from it, but, um, I kinda
like, uh, decide to go at a

190
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:12,735
slower pace while my startup,
um, and try to return back to

191
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,134
the,

192
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:20,416
um, development and land and to
see the world, the, the world of

193
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,595
frameworks and the role of
Jesus, all the frameworks, all

194
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,774
the

195
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,855
tools, all the expectations.
Like I'm going to be the job

196
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:32,265
descriptions. I'm like, oh Lord
Jesus. Well, who do you think

197
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,675
you

198
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:41,100
have? You know, Um, I'm like,
okay, I am, I guess I'm back

199
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,331
into, I feel like I'm kinda like
at the beginning stages, you

200
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,876
know, there's some things I
realize where my gaps are. And

201
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:48,421
so

202
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,780
I'm trying to fix that up and
stuff like that. So that's what

203
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm doing lately.

204
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,660
Bekah: Yeah, it's wild because
you know, you have that

205
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,760
experience of front end or full
stack even, and then this pivot.

206
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,431
You're focused on this other
thing you come back, you know,

207
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:09,591
and there's just so much tech
moves so quickly. I just want to

208
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,840
take a second talk about, like,
why did you jump into the

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,879
startup

210
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,380
life to begin with? Like, what
about that was interesting to

211
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,681
you?

212
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,090
Helen: Uh, it wasn't the start
of that. Interesting to me, what

213
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,604
was

214
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:28,125
interesting was I got tired of
getting laid off that that would

215
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:33,855
make anybody pivot. I think I
ended up, I was. The I was with

216
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,315
um, the organization for like
six years get laid off and then

217
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,625
it

218
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,855
took another year before I get
another job got that job. And

219
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,105
then, um, and that company, oh
my God, that was like, what's

220
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,355
that

221
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:51,346
show Housewives Housewives. or
whatever that.

222
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,990
Bekah: oh. Or the real
Housewives

223
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,730
Helen: Housewives. I swear, that
was like the real Housewives of

224
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,201
executives or something like
that, that like we was in a

225
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,801
remote team and the amount of
mess that was going on with that

226
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:08,791
organization. Like when you find
out executives was punching some

227
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:14,431
other executive and that's the
great vibe is like, Oh, yeah. I

228
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,260
knew I was like, layoffs was
coming. I just don't know when

229
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,721
I'm just going to collect my
check from working with my

230
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,406
startup and just, yeah, I knew
I, yeah, so. I knew it was

231
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:27,091
coming. I

232
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,721
just was like, well, I got laid
off before, so we see what

233
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:33,016
happens. Maybe they might
change. Maybe they, you know,

234
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:35,311
whatever.

235
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,801
But, um, so yeah, I just, I
think I got tired of the layoffs

236
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,291
and I

237
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,431
was like, and I was around, I
got exposed to other startup

238
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,071
founders. Somehow I went to our
event and it was nothing but

239
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,670
startup founders. I don't know
how I went to this vet. it was

240
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,269
it

241
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,817
was supposed to be for like
developer. And tech people, and

242
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,364
I

243
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,186
just assumed everybody was
developer. And that's when I got

244
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:00,855
exposed to startups and I
started to go onto other meetups

245
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,524
and

246
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,355
stuff like that. And again, this
bows and at the time the

247
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:07,185
scenario

248
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,836
was, Andy had some accelerators
that open up their workspace for

249
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,105
people to come and work. And I
just, once I found those people,

250
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:19,005
I just kind of like was like
white on rice. I just stuck on

251
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:22,591
them. I wouldn't. Just trying to
consume as much knowledge as

252
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:28,740
possible. So, yeah. Oh, here's a
funny story. This, this is how I

253
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,380
was so clueless about business.
Um, I was trying, once I found

254
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,180
out about this affiliate
program, I tried to apply for

255
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,980
it. And he

256
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,500
was like, and he had no business
applying. Cause I didn't know

257
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,961
nothing about business. I didn't
have no problem. I was trying to

258
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,811
solve for nothing. I didn't know
nothing, but I still, I was

259
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:47,071
trying to apply for it. And a
guy, he was so kind, he just

260
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:48,331
sent

261
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:51,150
me to the side. They tried to
explain stuff to me and he was

262
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,841
like, product are you building?
And that, and I was so lost when

263
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:58,591
he kept saying product. I was
like, no, I'm a web developer.

264
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:01,800
Like what you make fun. was
like, what you talking about?

265
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,269
I'm not

266
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,120
trying to open up a small
business trying to because to

267
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,970
me,

268
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,475
I thought products, which is
what you see at the retail

269
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,979
stores. had

270
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,260
to be some kind of hardware or
some type of fabric, you know,

271
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,540
it

272
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,696
wasn't. You know, had to be
somebody you get off a shelf or

273
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,585
off my hanger. That was a
product. didn't realize that,

274
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,474
um,

275
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:29,055
a website was a product. I
didn't realize I was a product.

276
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:31,575
just

277
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,240
like, no, I'm a web developer.
So that was funny. So, yeah.

278
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,904
Yeah.

279
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:41,105
Dan: Well, that, that whole like
language barrier is, is true.

280
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,135
think of it a lot with
development stuff, you know? Uh,

281
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,920
but it's true. Any, any, any,
like you enter any realm that

282
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,465
you

283
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:51,105
haven't been in before and
Language different, you know?

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,240
Helen: Oh, yeah.

285
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,025
Dan: an interesting, like, I
dunno, aspect to think about for

286
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,525
like, events like that, you
know, is like, where do you set

287
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,025
that?

288
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,775
Where do you set the bar? You
know? Um, and like, what's there

289
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,590
in a world for so long. You
talk, you kind forget that

290
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,405
people don't

291
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,166
like already know you speak,
know?

292
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:10,206
Helen: Yeah.

293
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,805
Dan: think that's easy. Like a
lot of people walking into a

294
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,005
new,

295
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,946
realm, you know, experience that
a lot.

296
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,905
Helen: It is a face. A funny
thing I realized just came to

297
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,595
realization. Like reading in
some docs kept, it was like, you

298
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:24,274
know

299
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,385
how you know, word, you know,
what a word means? And he kind

300
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,473
of. might want to say 70%
understand where there, where

301
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:31,561
the

302
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,230
president's talking about, but
you'd like, there's still a

303
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,140
slight un-clarity in You're
trying to figure out I kept

304
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,591
getting pissed off. Every time I
kept reading all these dots,

305
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,461
Bekah: Yeah.

306
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,706
Helen: abstract something. I was
like, what the heck? And then I

307
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:52,035
realized what they're trying to
say is we simplify it. So you

308
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,975
don't have to write all this
boatload of code. All you got to

309
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,030
do is just write this one line
of code. was just, I was

310
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,085
somebody

311
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:04,365
create tool where you could just
do a short command and you could

312
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:09,135
search and copy and retweets,
every word let's say abstract,

313
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,000
something in these dots. And
they say simple. be so much

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,865
easier.

315
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,865
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's a
huge thing. Like we had talked

316
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:19,990
about that at some point. I
think there's an issue still up

317
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,115
on

318
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:27,836
Virtual Coffees. I'm sorry, repo
where they're like a Chrome

319
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:31,946
extension, right? Like if you
it's specifically for. Web

320
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:36,235
development docs, you hover over
that thing there's a definition

321
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:40,255
for it, right? Like, because
there's so many things like

322
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,785
exactly what you're saying.
Nope. People don't remember them

323
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,315
once

324
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,951
they're past a certain stage,
many people don't. And so

325
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,586
there's

326
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,235
no definitions and you just kind
of have to fill in that

327
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,884
education

328
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,515
for yourself. And it doesn't
matter if you're self-taught or

329
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,456
bootcamp or have a degree
because. And they gloss over

330
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:01,716
these things and there's so much
to learn so quickly that you're

331
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,920
not going to remember all of
that And so being able to have

332
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,124
that

333
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:12,336
quick reference, there's like
somebody sent me, um, oh, it's a

334
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:16,336
tech blog and is so, so good. I
can't remember what it is right

335
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,066
now, but does that you hover
over something and gives other

336
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,796
links.

337
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,281
It might be done in obsidian. So
it might be done through

338
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,736
obsidian

339
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,210
publish. so it takes you to the
next thing, if you want to go.

340
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,684
so

341
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,836
there's like examples, there's
definitions. Like this is what

342
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:36,885
documentation should have
available because not every.

343
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,965
Again, follow that linear
documentation structure. It

344
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,600
should be like a, choose your
own adventure documentation to

345
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,235
help

346
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:47,536
you figure out what you need in
that moment.

347
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,931
Helen: Yeah, exactly.

348
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,641
Dan: uh, a product we're working
on right now. Um, there it is

349
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,931
that product right on, uh, a web
app that we're working on right

350
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,500
now. Um, we're trying to deal
with that same thing with not

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,050
inside the code or not
developers, but for people who

352
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,961
are using it, right. It's like
the first time you use it, or

353
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,830
first few times he use it, it's
all new and probably kind of

354
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,590
confusing, but it's meant to be
a tool that like you use a lot.

355
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:18,300
Right? And so once you get used
to. Uh, we don't want to like up

356
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,840
the thing with like tons of help
stuff, you know, and trying out

357
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,760
what level of like, you know, or
like, do we really do it? Just,

358
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,040
do we just have a button? Like
you're saying this like, show,

359
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,580
like explain everything to me,
you And then like a button that

360
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,861
says, okay, I'm good. I got this
now. You know,

361
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,881
Bekah: Yeah, it's there's a tab
or

362
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,721
Dan: pretty like set that level.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

363
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,101
Bekah: So give me all of the
links here

364
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,425
Helen: Yeah. yeah. I think that
people, we, we, we, we need to

365
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,520
be

366
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,760
like, I understand the idea of
you just trying to simplify

367
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,100
things. You just trying to give
a basic UI so people can just

368
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,440
get

369
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:58,310
in there and get work, but you
still haven't barrier. Before I

370
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,096
begin to work. Get used to this
environment. It's just like,

371
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:04,850
Yeah. I'm used to cook in my
kitchen, but you throw me in

372
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,485
your

373
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:10,326
kitchen. I'm not going to start
cooking right away. I still got

374
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,445
to go figure out where you put
your pet pots and pans where the

375
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,695
salt and pepper makes sure you
have seasoning, you know, just

376
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:20,556
check out stuff, you know, find
where they're at, you know? Um,

377
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,955
and it isn't, I'm not going to
be able to just get up and just

378
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,265
the

379
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:29,105
web up time and gonna be quick.
So I think we have to remember

380
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:33,921
that. Beyond the, what? The web
app or wherever at we building.

381
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:37,371
There's also another app we got
to focus before they even get to

382
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,641
get to there. It's called
onboarding. That's a whole, it's

383
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,230
all on the environment.

384
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,900
Dan: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
Onboarding is like, yeah, we

385
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,460
talk

386
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,671
about that a lot. Um, we talked
about that a lot with Virtual

387
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:50,990
Coffee too is like the
community, right? Cause we got a

388
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,309
lot of

389
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,990
stuff going on the same, same
situation, you know? Um, I don't

390
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,590
know. I could talk again for a
long time about this. There's

391
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,541
lot, a lot of, you know, a lot
of pieces to that puzzle and

392
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,431
it's

393
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,980
all kind of interesting and
important. Um,

394
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,560
Helen: Yeah. think it's it's. I
think we should treat it just

395
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,035
like how some founders, they had
to put it in their schedule to

396
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,510
go

397
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,090
back and their own, Um, apps and
web apps and products as if they

398
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,316
was a new. So they can see this
experience again, because you so

399
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,346
much time will go by. Cause
you're doing so much other stuff

400
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:33,215
that you forget and you don't
know what has broken what got

401
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:37,415
lost in translation. as
developers, we should do that to

402
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:40,015
be like, okay, let's pretend
I'm, I'm a user. This is my

403
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:42,605
first time

404
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:46,836
in this environment. Or let's
pretend I'm a developer. I just

405
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:50,780
graduated. This was my first
time. And I'm. You know, just to

406
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,871
get an understanding, you know,
is equivalent to like how

407
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:59,270
executives to go in and do some
manual tasks, just to understand

408
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,631
what their teams go through once
in a while kind of thing. So.

409
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:08,135
Dan: Yeah, That is like good
advice for not just like the

410
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,625
owners, you know, but everybody
that's doing it. It's so easy to

411
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,566
get caught when you're like
caught in the weeds, you know,

412
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,465
like when you're living and
breathing a project for a long

413
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:20,915
time, you know, you lose sight
of. Like beginning. I don't even

414
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:24,036
know what the login or not the
login, but like the new user

415
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:26,586
screen looks like on this app
that I work on every day, you

416
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,786
know, because I haven't looked
at it for

417
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,621
Helen: Yeah.

418
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:33,036
Dan: a long, long time. Um, and
it's it's yeah, that's, of very

419
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:33,546
good advice.

420
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:35,345
Bekah: Well, like going back to
what you said about onboarding

421
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,559
to

422
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,320
it's part of that, you know,
because I think that it doesn't

423
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,010
matter what stage you're at when
you join a new company. I just

424
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,211
joined company a month ago and
I've felt very comfortable to

425
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:48,755
give feedback like, Hey, this
is, this is what I thought when

426
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:50,299
I

427
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,425
read this. And so maybe we can
add clearer documentation here,

428
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:56,875
right.

429
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:57,286
Helen: Yeah.

430
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:00,296
Bekah: everybody that's coming
new into a company, almost

431
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:04,885
everybody is going to have that
new experience and be able to

432
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:08,905
more clearly point out those
things make sure that, you know,

433
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,645
you, you have the most
up-to-date information, but

434
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,385
sometimes like

435
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,486
you have to invite people to do
that. Right.

436
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:14,996
Helen: Yeah.

437
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,306
Bekah: if they feel like, oh,
you're just supposed to rush

438
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,070
through this thing not. Please
feel free to give us your

439
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,270
feedback on it, then you're
you're losing out on all of the

440
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,270
value that a new employee brings
to a position.

441
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:32,381
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. Especially,
they feel like you don't want to

442
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,560
hear it, then you definitely
screwed, you know?

443
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,865
Bekah: Like, oh, that takes too
much time. Like, we don't want

444
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:38,750
to

445
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,441
have to do that.

446
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,000
Helen: Yeah.

447
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,987
Bekah: Okay, so Lee, I want to
talk a little bit about, so

448
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,942
first

449
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,142
of all, I've been super
impressed with all of the stuff

450
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,342
that you're

451
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:52,182
doing and you're always, I feel
like you're always on a drive to

452
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,093
learn and that's, what's so
great because I think that's the

453
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:57,312
mindset that everybody really
should have app. Asking

454
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:59,531
questions

455
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:02,923
and talking about these things.
And so like, what you think that

456
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,888
you've learned from your past
that you're bringing with you

457
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,853
to,

458
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,792
I feel like this is kind of like
the new stage of hell and you're

459
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,593
like moving into this new thing

460
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,347
Helen: Yeah.

461
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,732
Bekah: time other places. Do you
have thoughts on that?

462
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:19,557
Helen: Um, yeah, I get thoughts
on that. Um, let me think about

463
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:22,467
it. Uh, no, I do have thoughts.
Uh, as I say, one thing I

464
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,377
learned

465
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:32,127
my whole experience is that, um,
life is hard. But a lot of times

466
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,542
you end up choosing your
struggles that? you're in so

467
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,957
many

468
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,297
things are happening to you,
which is true. But then

469
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:41,037
sometimes

470
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,928
it's like, you could have, you
have, um, you have a point where

471
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,742
you can make a choice, be like,
okay, no more, you know, and

472
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,556
just

473
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:51,950
figure out some way to get out
of it or, um, Oh, even less than

474
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,343
the

475
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,292
pain, if you can't get out of
it, because there there's some

476
00:23:56,292 --> 00:24:00,403
problems that are just huge. Um,
also mostly know, most

477
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:05,053
importantly, my past experience,
I learned that to learn how to

478
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:08,728
invest in you so many times had
to, um, to, especially by being

479
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:12,403
a

480
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:15,103
startup founder, I had believe
in myself try and do something.

481
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:17,803
Even

482
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,393
was not qualified, when I was
complete ignorant about

483
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:25,722
something. Um, and then most
important, I didn't have the

484
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:30,403
resources or the capital, you
know, or the network to educate

485
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:32,082
me on something. I had to go
learn it figure out what I

486
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:33,761
didn't

487
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:35,817
know. And then go find out where
I can learn or get what I need

488
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,872
to

489
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:41,023
know. Um, I think the first time
I had to drop $1,500 on to

490
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:44,173
invest

491
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:50,292
in myself was like, okay, If we
go and do this, I know you just

492
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:55,903
got laid off. We go and do this.
We can do this. This is going to

493
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:57,748
give you closer to being a
startup founder. This is going

494
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,593
to

495
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:01,583
have you close it to this
person. So this, you know, some

496
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,573
people be

497
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,992
like, why would you do that?
That's not guaranteed.

498
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:06,313
Bekah: Yeah.

499
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,663
Helen: guaranteeing, which is
true. There's No, guarantee

500
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:12,083
whether you're going to, there's
going to be success after your

501
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,022
tasks. You've complete it. And
there's no, guarantee that you

502
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:17,212
even got to complete the task,
which is funny too, but you

503
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,402
still

504
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:26,573
had to, I still have to learn to
invest in myself. now when now,

505
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,125
it's much easier to make
decisions. You know, cause I

506
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,677
done

507
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:34,483
that. I made so many decisions,
both small and big. So it's

508
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:37,288
like,

509
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,002
okay, what's my values while I'm
trying to attain. Now, this

510
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:42,687
align

511
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:47,067
to, what I trying to do? Is this
a compromise or is this a trade

512
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:53,667
off is or sacrifice? know, so
it's much easier make these mini

513
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,938
choices that we make every day
kind of thing people might

514
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,617
prolong for months on.

515
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:00,788
Bekah: Yeah.

516
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:04,587
Helen: Yeah, and didn't make me
make y'all depressed.

517
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:06,982
Dan: no,

518
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,087
Helen: I got quiet real quick.
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,873
Dan: I was, I was trying to
process what you said. I think

520
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:15,593
that's, I think that was all
great. Um, I think one of those,

521
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:21,252
know, you talked, um, at the
beginning about how. You know,

522
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:24,462
doing the startup process or
whatever, like an MBA, you know,

523
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:27,492
this cost money and all this
stuff. And I think re like

524
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:31,663
framing it like that as a, as an
investment in yourself is, is

525
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:34,002
great. You know, it was a really
healthy way to look at it. And

526
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:36,583
it's true too. Right. And that's
just like this, this like

527
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,187
decision framework that you just
described, even if you don't

528
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,791
like

529
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,592
call it a framework in your
head. Right. But like, just like

530
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:43,271
muscle

531
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,913
memory almost, you know, you
practice it. And so you get good

532
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,900
at it. And being able to. Do
that where you, where you're

533
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,887
looking

534
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:55,288
at a decision and, um, know how
to it apart and like figure out

535
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:56,263
what you're looking at. Right.
Just exactly, like you said,

536
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,238
like

537
00:26:57,238 --> 00:27:00,538
a, is this sacrifice? Is this,
you know, sort of compromise,

538
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,157
like, I don't know, it's such a
valuable tool, um, or skill. Um,

539
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:10,337
and that's really cool and it's
my silence finished documents I

540
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,397
was to process that. Cause, um,
it was, uh, I don't know, it was

541
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,167
quiet and it was really well
put, I thought,

542
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,103
Bekah: Yeah.

543
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,163
Helen: Thanks.

544
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:20,907
Bekah: Like I remember when I
was coming into tech a couple of

545
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,988
years ago, we didn't have much
money. I've got four kids. And

546
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:30,327
somebody said, Hey, like, meet
you at Starbucks a half an hour

547
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:31,827
away. And like, for me, it was
that same thing. Like I had to

548
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,327
go

549
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:37,678
through my head and think about
like, there's there's money.

550
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,587
There's a cost to drive there.
There's I had a Starbucks card.

551
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:42,478
So I was like, I can use my
Starbucks card. I don't have to

552
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:46,347
worry about that. But like, even
that little bit of gas money

553
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:48,934
there. Required me to think
about like, am I investing in?

554
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,521
And, and

555
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:55,482
ultimately, like I was investing
in myself and retrospectively, I

556
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:56,623
can see that, like, this

557
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:57,188
Helen: Yeah.

558
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,313
Bekah: being able to meet
somebody because that led me to

559
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,382
the support system that got me
through learning how to code,

560
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:04,242
but

561
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:04,798
Helen: Yeah.

562
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:06,492
Bekah: hard in that moment

563
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:06,768
Helen: Yeah.

564
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,182
Bekah: to think like, okay, you
know, there's money that I can

565
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:13,542
spend here is that money worth
it? And like right. Nothing is

566
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:18,607
guaranteed there. But, you know,
think about what the long-term

567
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:23,617
investment is and, and where
that can take you. It's hard.

568
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:25,422
Helen: Yeah. I Al I always share
this with people. I was like,

569
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:26,997
the

570
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,758
struggle is, well, I'm not going
to even try to downplay that

571
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:34,258
soccer. The struggles will, but
even when you, when there's no

572
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:37,978
guarantees and there's a high
probability that you will lose,

573
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,928
quote, unquote, lose whatever,
try to have a backup Like if you

574
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:46,498
can obtain the thing that you're
get, what else can help you

575
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:49,167
support you to get you closer to
the thing you're trying to get?

576
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:54,327
Right. So, Um, so a lot of times
meeting up with these people,

577
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:59,008
like, cause you have to eat
there. Time is money. have to be

578
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,123
very cautious on your time You
know, you got to make sure

579
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:03,238
you're

580
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:08,968
leveraging your skills and your
time appropriately, but you also

581
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:12,928
want to make sure that you get
something out of it where you

582
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:15,387
can, um, that were be
beneficial, not to be sounds or

583
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,846
selfish, but

584
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:21,112
also, but still get the support.
Right. So, so a lot of times

585
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:24,347
when

586
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:30,198
I meet people and w I learned to
not accept a meeting or do a

587
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:32,897
meeting where there no agenda,
was no goal. I had to that out.

588
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,596
I

589
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:38,208
wasn't with, for the longest
time, I was wait for them to

590
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,208
figure out the agenda, but like,
no, no, no, no, baby, no, no,

591
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,208
no,

592
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:41,942
no. figure out what you need. A
lot of times people have not

593
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:43,666
even

594
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,337
take the moment to figure out
what they need and what they

595
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:52,407
want. Um, unfortunately people
will wait until they hit a Crow

596
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:58,347
crossroad. generally when some
type of life transition or crap

597
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:00,732
happened to you, which was
sucks. it's better to use your

598
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,117
make,

599
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:04,737
take a Saturday and a month. And
you use those times to have

600
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,357
those

601
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:10,647
life choice, moments, get some
coffee or tea and brunch, you

602
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,228
know, and just figure out and,
and journal and just write some

603
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,258
stuff down or even using no pat
on your phone. If you don't want

604
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:21,117
to write. Oh, a voice and just
trust are asking those small

605
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:25,407
questions like questions, you
know, like having a little Oprah

606
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:30,117
was that, so Sunday we'll have
your own soul Sunday and figured

607
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:32,968
this stuff out if you don't
figure that out, trust me,

608
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,678
somebody's going to figure it
out for you. So.

609
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,012
Bekah: I love that because it
is, you know, if you're, if

610
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:40,346
you're

611
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:43,887
not doing that consistently or
not taking that time out, then,

612
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,768
then it just like keeps coming.
Right. It

613
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,458
Helen: Yeah.

614
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:49,092
Bekah: it never stops because
there will continually be asks

615
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,636
of

616
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:54,208
you or things that you need to
figure out for yourself. So if

617
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,357
you know, like this is what I'm
going to figure it out, then it

618
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,292
feels less overwhelming the
other three weeks or, you know,

619
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,227
other

620
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,317
six days of the week, however
you decide to plan it. So

621
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:04,528
Helen: Yeah.

622
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:09,772
Bekah: that. I know I'm going to
make decisions on this day and

623
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,972
then you can do that without
having to worry. Hopefully.

624
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,083
Helen: Have you ever, I'm not
sure if it's me, but I have

625
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,682
noticed for my, in my own
personal life, that lessons that

626
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:25,633
you thought you had. We'll
revisit your revisit you to try

627
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:31,002
you out. It's like if it's like,
w like, walk up today and chose

628
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:34,813
violence was going to let know
what thing you thought you, you

629
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:41,442
learned. Let's try it again, you
know? So it just come in a

630
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,282
different form.

631
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:43,907
Bekah: it's like, oh yeah. I
said that I had mastered this

632
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:45,316
thing.

633
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:50,627
And then it's like, you, uh, no,
no, I didn't. I didn't master

634
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:51,077
anything.

635
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:51,857
Helen: Yeah.

636
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,583
Dan: Uh, man. Yep. No, that's,
that's interesting though,

637
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,982
because that sort of thing is
like, you know, you can process

638
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:07,482
something after and identify
where made a mistake or what you

639
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:10,212
could do different, but you
probably made those mistakes or

640
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:14,563
did things that maybe weren't
good the moment because the.

641
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,653
Well, how you think when you're
stressed is different than how

642
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:18,883
you think when you're relaxed,
right? How you

643
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:19,208
Helen: Yeah.

644
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,702
Dan: you're upset is different
than how you think when you're

645
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:22,482
happy. Right.

646
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:23,298
Helen: Yeah.

647
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:27,522
Dan: think that can go along,
like, uh, back to your or your

648
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:32,413
idea of having a plan like that.
And, um, if you have something

649
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:36,732
like that to fall back on a goal
or a whatever, or, you know,

650
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,577
these lessons that you've
learned, but, um, when things

651
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:40,392
are

652
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:45,208
bad, you know, how. Thinking.
Okay. Does this help my further,

653
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,758
my goal, you know, instead of
just reacting, know, just

654
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,993
reacting to, as, as it comes,
you know, like it's kind of all

655
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,228
ties

656
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,758
in together is really cool.

657
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,333
Helen: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

658
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:56,397
Dan: really good way to be.

659
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,423
Bekah: Yeah. So this ties back
into like the things that you've

660
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,643
been doing. Cause you're doing a
lot of like really great things

661
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:03,488
to help people. And you've got
this, um, state of developers

662
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,333
and

663
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:10,432
you've got Right. And so, do you
want to introduce what those

664
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,982
things are to our listeners? And
then we'll kind of talk about

665
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:14,752
like how you're supporting
people through this.

666
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,807
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. for
bringing it up. Um, so, uh,

667
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:20,507
state

668
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:23,462
of developers is a, um, industry
survey that I launch right

669
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:26,416
before

670
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,907
Christmas, where I'm trying to
survey developers, um, on

671
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,397
burnout

672
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:37,792
and their experience burnout,
anxiety, and depression. Um, So

673
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,292
it's, I'm asking it's premium
Lutz, a holistic view on it

674
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:46,163
because I realized that, you
know, when you're at work, you

675
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:48,202
bring your whole self to work.
Um, so whatever, all the crap

676
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:50,241
you

677
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:54,133
had to deal with at home that
comes to work with you, AI it

678
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:56,212
carpools with you. Um, and
whatever happens at work

679
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:58,281
carpools

680
00:33:58,313 --> 00:33:58,583
with you.

681
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,232
Bekah: take the carpool lane
then

682
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,208
Helen: And you could try, you
could try. I think the PoPo

683
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,863
gonna

684
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:16,163
be like, ah, uh, so yeah, I, I,
cause I noticed that, um, there

685
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:20,782
was something I struggled with a
lot and I noticed that it wasn't

686
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:25,793
a very high priority in business
world. You know? Um, this is

687
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:32,188
always falls under the. The
wellness, whatever will, we time

688
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:36,538
doing, doing, dowel months. We
can focus on that, you know, but

689
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:41,637
we have to focus on these OKR as
our objectives or KPIs or key

690
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:44,772
performance indicators,
whatever. Um, and I, and I, I

691
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:47,907
always won't

692
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:52,722
allow myself to focus too much
on it because. Like I wanted to

693
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:58,032
create a product or app to help
me with this, but because I knew

694
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,943
it wasn't high priority, busy in
a business world, I was like,

695
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:03,222
that's another way for me to be
broke. And Helen, you already

696
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:08,472
have bad ideas. I never allow
myself, but I started noticing

697
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:15,733
that I was like, if I'm burnout
and I had some, some dark

698
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:20,188
moments. I know someone else has
some dark moments. I know if

699
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:25,737
somebody else is struggling with
coding and like, and trying to

700
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:31,918
balance life, life, me, my
current, um, life situation, I'm

701
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:38,097
trying to, uh, come up from
shutting down a startup, trying

702
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:42,088
to reenter the market, you know,
trying to learn some new skills

703
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:43,707
on top of that. I got an elderly
paradigm helping cold

704
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,117
characters.

705
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:50,527
You know, um, all of that is a
lot of stress. I'm not going to

706
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:53,648
be talking about trying to do
chores. John, trying to do the

707
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:58,538
job, honey that's in itself is a
whole day's work and that, so I

708
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:01,657
have less several full-time jobs
throughout throughout the day.

709
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:04,776
So

710
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,268
was like, if I'm struggling, you
had to be somebody else

711
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:13,088
struggling. And, and this is too
important to keep pushing as a

712
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,543
low priority. You know, this
guy, the impact, the bottom line

713
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:19,378
somehow, you know, and I start,
I start, Um, asking developers

714
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:22,213
and

715
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,213
tech founders for any of those.
Dan was one of them. So he

716
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:28,393
gracefully didn't want with me
and just ask him a series of

717
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:30,462
questions. And then, and the,
the mother stuff people was

718
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:32,531
telling

719
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:36,463
me, I was like, oh shit, this is
something okay. We need to get

720
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,463
math numbers for people to
realize, no, this is something

721
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,020
serious. Okay. You think. This
is not important. Like there's

722
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,577
one

723
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:49,077
insight. I don't want to quite
share yet that across the board,

724
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:53,217
depending on the developer and
the amount of privilege they

725
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,242
have, I was like in managers
knew they was making they

726
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,267
decisions

727
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,068
like this. were freaked

728
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:00,498
Bekah: Yeah.

729
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:08,052
Helen: Right. And I saw, I did
like last I. Or damn some energy

730
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:11,862
engineer managers. And I asked
them, I didn't out, nobody. I

731
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:17,592
just say, have you lost because
of this reason, age one, I'm

732
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:24,702
saying, no, no, no, no, no. I'm
like really Cause I, I changed

733
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,742
the way I questioned that. I
said, Hey, have you lost talent

734
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:31,242
because of this reason. Um, and
if not, and if not, tell me your

735
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:33,627
secret and people would just
start us blaming their way.

736
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,012
Being

737
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:39,193
mindful and having their own
wellness programs and stuff like

738
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,602
that. And then there's some that
some men are just like, well,

739
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:42,011
I'm

740
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,607
not sure, but this is how my
people are struggling. Or this

741
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,202
is

742
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,902
how I'm trying to prevent my
people from struggling. And they

743
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:53,092
even know that it's the
workload, but like one per one

744
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:56,282
managers,

745
00:37:56,322 --> 00:38:00,373
like, like he said, if I didn't
have the authority to push back,

746
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:03,485
I would even quit. That's his
whole. That's this whole guy,

747
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:06,568
the

748
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:09,283
jail free card, his bike is the
push mat kind of thing. So,

749
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:11,998
Yeah.

750
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:15,088
So, so that's what state of the
developer is. It's just, it's a

751
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:21,088
holistic survey. I'm trying to,
I have to, um, have them been

752
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:25,347
promoting it this month because
I'm trying to shorten it. I've

753
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:28,228
been, that's the number one
feedback I get from the

754
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:29,157
developers in the last.

755
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:30,507
Bekah: Yeah.

756
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,787
Helen: right now, I'm just
trying to, I'm trying to get con

757
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,542
um,

758
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,112
condense it, you know, Mert some
of the questions and stuff like

759
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:40,347
that and make it simpler. Uh,
so, but I'm going to relaunch

760
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:42,582
it, um,

761
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:47,623
um, March and try to get more
people to, um, fill it. Um, and

762
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:50,037
I, hopefully I can be with a,
share the resorts results in,

763
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,451
um,

764
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:55,452
this summer, because the goal
was, I just didn't want to just.

765
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,353
Do a survey and we say, Yeah.
everybody's up because we are

766
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:05,862
tired and we broke and we tired.
We mentally broke. We just, so,

767
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:08,742
you know, that's why you got
these crappy products, you know,

768
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:13,032
but I wanted to also provide,
like, some of the questions is

769
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:16,362
asking people how they cope, how
did they deal with, how did they

770
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:22,137
help diddly manage it? You know,
kind of thing. So. Um, compile a

771
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:25,827
list of resources so people can
try the south. Cause this one,

772
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:26,938
the thing about burnout,

773
00:39:27,182 --> 00:39:27,342
Bekah: Yup.

774
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:31,498
Helen: many factors contribute
to it and, and it's just like

775
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:36,958
productivity, um, is it's it's
not like one, it's not a one

776
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:42,507
solution is really up to the
person what's in the context of

777
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:47,922
their life. Are there variables
they have to deal with? So. So

778
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,563
that's where instead of
developers. Sorry, ask that now.

779
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:51,282
So go ahead.

780
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:53,217
Dan: no, not at all. I think
it's great. I think it's, I

781
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:54,732
think it's

782
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,603
very cool. And I, I think maybe
walk into this, but the Jovial

783
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:04,407
is, it is sort of. About framing
it, not for like the individual.

784
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,617
Right. But for the company who
has developers as employees.

785
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:07,978
Right.

786
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:08,773
Helen: Yeah.

787
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:11,593
Dan: how to this is, this is
like the. This is one of the

788
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:14,188
parts

789
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:17,728
that's like re very interesting
to me, right. Is, is like that

790
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:21,597
turning Cause cause company,
most companies don't like hire

791
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:22,977
developers and say, I'm going to
burn these people out. Right.

792
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:24,357
You

793
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:26,487
know? so they don't like, uh,
that it's probably, don't

794
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:28,616
realize

795
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,642
it, you know, or don't mean to.
so, uh, I was just wondering,

796
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,667
you

797
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,588
know, what, like what are ways
after it, you know, after

798
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:39,435
information all of developers
is, uh, if you. Are thinking

799
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:42,543
more as

800
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,547
a manager or something like
that. Like what are, what are

801
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:44,551
like some

802
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:47,612
ways to support your developers
and, and like watch for stuff

803
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,103
like this and prevent it from
happening, things like

804
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:55,077
Helen: Yeah. Yeah. So, So. just,
just for disclaimer. Shelby has

805
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,668
gone through like his own, um,
evolution kind of thing. Um,

806
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:04,648
because the, solution that I was
trying to propose as to solving

807
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:07,858
this problem, didn't pan out,
right? That's one thing about

808
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:12,507
startup world. So I wasn't sold
on, I'm not married to that

809
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:15,958
solution. married to trying to
figure out how hell then don't

810
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:21,898
be. This time next year, That's
what I'm sold on too. So, um,

811
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:26,998
right now Jovial is the whole
goal is definitely is more, um,

812
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:32,818
helping teams, um, to manage the
burnout. Um, and it's, it's not

813
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:35,128
just also just identifying
signals, but I'm thinking of

814
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:37,438
more

815
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:40,978
of Craney a developer tool
where, um, it allows both

816
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:44,518
parties the,

817
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:51,012
before. Right about the issue.
And that's really meaning being

818
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:55,123
transparent about different
things about your own goals.

819
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:58,483
Because a lot of times people
won't say something because you

820
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:01,543
know, that might go against
company policy, or they might,

821
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:05,503
that might that developer, the
manager might not want to tell

822
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,262
the developer does the developer
just want to call and he, the

823
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:11,503
manager might need him to step
up or her to step up and take a

824
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:14,472
leadership role is it's just
like, like how Can we help each

825
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:19,168
other along. Our goals and help
help each other instead of

826
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:25,108
sabotage each other's success
kind of thing. So, um, right now

827
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:27,162
Jovial is looking like, um,
while I'm trying to, I guess

828
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:29,187
this is my

829
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:32,113
first time me just sharing it
and trying to, um, see if

830
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:35,038
giving, um,

831
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:38,697
developers like an NPS tool,
kind of like an NPS score, like

832
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:42,326
on on

833
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,637
like how, like, when.

834
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,978
Bekah: you pause for a second?
What is NPS? I'm sorry, I don't

835
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:49,282
Helen: So I, so NPS is like a
net promoter score. You usually,

836
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:51,427
get

837
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,248
them as a customer, like, let's
say you bought, like, I bought

838
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:56,858
KFC the other day and I on my
receipt. You go to the website,

839
00:42:56,918 --> 00:42:59,132
they was like, how likely are
you to. How buyers buy this

840
00:42:59,132 --> 00:43:01,346
chicken

841
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:04,858
sandwich is again, how do I get
for employees? They normally get

842
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:08,577
NPS score that say, how lucky
are you to invite your developer

843
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:13,887
buddies to platform job here.
trying to gauge how much and how

844
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:16,542
much you don't kind of thing
with whoever you're working

845
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:19,197
with. So

846
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:22,858
mostly it's like, it's like, why
don't we have an MPS score on

847
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:29,998
just really gauge how much. This
task or how much this woke is,

848
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:30,262
Bekah: Yeah.

849
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,628
Helen: impacting you and also
impacting the company. Because

850
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:35,818
one of the things I've learned
through the survey is that a lot

851
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:40,378
of developers don't know if
they're making an impact. I was

852
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:41,682
like, how do you measure your
progress? How do you measure

853
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:42,986
your

854
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,987
impact daily? Even know if they,
they make, have an impact, they

855
00:43:45,987 --> 00:43:49,077
only have, like most of the
developers don't even have

856
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:54,967
metrics. They to judge. Or
they're worth, not even

857
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:55,463
Bekah: Yeah.

858
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:59,257
Helen: goals or metrics for
themselves, from the company.

859
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:04,208
Right. it's just more of like
right now, I'm just, I'm

860
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:08,318
researching it and I'm trying to
figure out how can help

861
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:15,188
developers to really, um,
measure, uh, what they done and

862
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:19,918
measure. Um, Like the
conversation, like, did they get

863
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:23,697
the feedback or the support that
they need? Um, cause one thing

864
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:28,318
when I did, I did like a
self-assessment, last week on my

865
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,047
own personal experience with
burnout. And once I realized

866
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:35,487
that. my main problem was I
wouldn't speak up about my own

867
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:39,838
needs and concerns. Like I would
suffer through like the whole

868
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,288
month of February. was me
suffering through trying to

869
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:48,722
relearn something. And learn a
new technology, whatever try to.

870
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,543
I got past a technical
interview, but I didn't tell my

871
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:53,853
family, I

872
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:59,103
even had the interview because I
didn't want them to feel anxious

873
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:01,802
about it because we were kind of
going through some stuff

874
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:06,663
financially. And I didn't want
that burden of pressure. Just in

875
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:09,422
case I don't get the interview
and which happened, I didn't get

876
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:14,353
the third interview. Right. So I
kept this to myself. So. But I

877
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:18,043
have an elegant parent and she's
waking up early. So she started

878
00:45:18,103 --> 00:45:19,902
kind of like interfere little
bit on my time when I was using

879
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:21,701
to

880
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:23,502
study. that made me wake up
three hours earlier. So that's.

881
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,302
like,

882
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:28,242
I'm up five in the morning, you
know, trying to do this stuff,

883
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:33,733
but could have like really saved
myself some of this agony, if I

884
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:37,422
just shared this information
where my family says, Hey, I got

885
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:39,807
this really hard thing I'm
trying to do. why little. And

886
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:42,192
that is, I

887
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:45,972
didn't want share because I
didn't want to disappoint. And

888
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:47,763
also it was just hard because
I'm still learning, trying to

889
00:45:47,763 --> 00:45:49,543
figure

890
00:45:49,543 --> 00:45:54,483
out the language. use with my
family to describe what the hell

891
00:45:54,512 --> 00:46:04,262
I do for a living. Like, I, I
can't figure it out. Every word

892
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:08,972
it's just like, you know, the
Charlie brown, um, TV show, the

893
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:11,762
parents. I was like, mama. Why,
why, why watch? That's how

894
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,332
family. Why, why, why, why? So,
yeah, so that's where I'm at.

895
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:18,362
I'm

896
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:22,572
looking at. Like really like
trying to figure out a way where

897
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,852
people can be transparent and
just open in their

898
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,132
communication,

899
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:31,483
you know? So I thought the best
way is just really just the

900
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,253
score. It score it for yourself.
And if you willing, you can

901
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:35,023
share

902
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:40,963
next person, but at least help
you break down and identify and

903
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:44,922
pinpoint some issues. So you can
bring it up to the right place.

904
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:50,498
So, I'm not sure if I confuse
you or not. I'm still learning.

905
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:56,353
Bekah: We're also like, for so
important because those

906
00:46:56,353 --> 00:47:00,972
conversations are super hard to
initiate and to talk about. And

907
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,722
last week, and one of my Virtual
Coffee breakout rooms, we talked

908
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:09,222
about, um, like what have you
taken from a past experience?

909
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:11,217
That was good, but you know,
your new work experience. And

910
00:47:11,217 --> 00:47:13,212
for me,

911
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:16,350
that was like, A really
important topic because I I've

912
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,487
been very

913
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:24,077
transparent about I'm going
through. And I've talked about

914
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:26,642
the PTSD that I've my life and
Tasha, like the last four

915
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,207
months.

916
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:31,242
Well, it's like clockwork, like
every two weeks, here's

917
00:47:31,242 --> 00:47:32,457
something

918
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,757
new to trigger you. Like not
stopping now. I'm like, I don't

919
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:39,272
know, right before this call, I
got a call about my mom had

920
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:41,787
heart

921
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:47,652
problems and a procedure and
stuff and it was like, You know,

922
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:52,032
like what do you do in those
situations? And for me, because

923
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:54,672
of my past experience, I'm like
able go to boss now and say

924
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,312
like,

925
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:59,412
Hey, listen, this is what's
going on in my life. I'm to try

926
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:01,511
but I'm

927
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,163
canceling my meetings for today

928
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:03,672
Helen: Yeah.

929
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:10,797
Bekah: that's going to be okay.
But like, I don't know that know

930
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:14,157
for sure that there out there
that would not feel confident

931
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,018
doing that thing. Right.

932
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:16,657
Helen: Yeah.

933
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:21,898
Bekah: and so if you, if you
have something that that open

934
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,617
conversation, like I am all for
that, because the more that we

935
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:30,387
can like we can, we can be
transparent with each. Well,

936
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:32,547
exactly. I love so much what you
said about like, you bring all

937
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:34,676
of

938
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,897
your experience to table and
that's been my. Talk for the

939
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,117
last

940
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,647
year I've been talking about the
person centered approach to

941
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:42,177
tech.

942
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,507
It's like, we're not, we're not
developers, we're human beings.

943
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:49,077
And have we have
responsibilities, we have these

944
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:51,222
things outside of tech and that
comes, that comes with us. it,

945
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:53,367
if

946
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,978
people don't acknowledge that,
then you're setting us up for

947
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:01,632
failure. And so I just really
love that idea that. Working on

948
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:08,322
helping to support the issues of
the whole people, the whole

949
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,302
person that comes to your team.

950
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:14,737
Helen: Yeah, Yeah, exactly is.
And it helps the managers too.

951
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:18,547
Like I'm not a manager, but,
well, I am because as a startup

952
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,217
founder, I had learn how to
manage three people and the man

953
00:49:21,217 --> 00:49:26,172
is the developer. And the men,
that's the founder Hela and add

954
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,583
the man has done invest in Helen
because she was pissed off

955
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:31,123
because she wasn't getting her
money back. So that was a whole

956
00:49:31,123 --> 00:49:33,837
nother management style I had to
learn. Um, but I think at the

957
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,551
end

958
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:39,943
of the day, we're just trying to
reduce the amount of risk we're

959
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:46,092
trying to make the worst case
scenario, the less worse, you

960
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:49,572
know, if it happens, it's like,
it's just like, I guess that's

961
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,410
why I'm looking at. Cause I
think one thing about burnout.

962
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,248
Um, and

963
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:56,608
the issue is about tackling it
and trying to get support around

964
00:49:56,637 --> 00:50:00,418
tagging them. It is because
people was, is like, awesome.

965
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:05,577
Nice to have the tack tackle it.
NOLA is nice. Just like it's,

966
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:08,323
it's, like it's worst case
scenario. It is the Murphy's

967
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:10,648
law.

968
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:11,132
Bekah: Yeah.

969
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:15,027
Helen: You know what I'm saying?
So, but for me personally, I

970
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:17,203
even, I had to get, buy in to
tackle it because I always

971
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:19,318
pushed

972
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:20,967
it to the side because it, to
me, there was always something

973
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,616
more

974
00:50:22,737 --> 00:50:28,827
poor and more grants bigger I
had to go fight and save kind of

975
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,677
thing. But at the same time it
was making life worse. Right. So

976
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:37,527
it's like, if you want life to
be a little bit easier, go

977
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:39,837
tackle

978
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:41,817
some of those demons. I'm
telling you be a ghost Buster,

979
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,796
figured it

980
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:43,887
out.

981
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:52,565
Bekah: It's valuable, super
valuable advice. Cause I think

982
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:54,695
that, you know, we always want
to do is do things in detriment

983
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,825
of

984
00:50:56,826 --> 00:51:02,795
ourselves. Like, everybody else
going forward. And we, we don't

985
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:07,300
take care of like what we need.
And it's a thing. Somebody told

986
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,541
me somebody DME, and they were
like, you're the one that said

987
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:12,176
you should put the oxygen mask
on first. So why don't you do

988
00:51:12,176 --> 00:51:13,811
it?

989
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:19,300
I'm like, I I should do the
things that I say

990
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,641
Helen: Yeah, no practice. What
you preach is so hard to do.

991
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:27,291
Yeah. It's just like, cause at
the end of the day, we trying to

992
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:33,740
manage things, you know? Um, and
we dealing with re reaction. So

993
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,580
when you don't say nothing. And
you do something, people going

994
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,420
to

995
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,471
react. Like I will, the reason I
was waking up early, because I

996
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:47,740
just found like, this is the
quiet as my house is it is once,

997
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:53,800
once one person up everybody's
up, you know? So my mom saw that

998
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:57,590
and she was like, okay, I'm
gonna wake up with, you know, I

999
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,050
need, I

1000
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,831
love you, but no,

1001
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:05,081
Bekah: Yes. I feel, I feel that
hardcore, my

1002
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:05,565
Helen: Yeah.

1003
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,360
Bekah: you wake me up at five?
No,

1004
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:13,915
Helen: you know, so it's, so as
a manager is like, if you're

1005
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:16,015
trying

1006
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:21,686
to support your team, trying to
China, manage stakeholders and

1007
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:26,096
stuff like that, you, your worst
enemy, your nemesis is that

1008
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:33,266
unknown variable. Right? So why
don't you. The so easy and

1009
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:37,436
comfortable for people to be
open, you know? Yes. He might

1010
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,220
hear something. He might not
lie, but even if let's say,

1011
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,004
let's say

1012
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:42,745
you hear a developer, he's have
M they're ambitious and they

1013
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:44,485
want

1014
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,826
to have they own startups. And
you know, there are way to

1015
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:50,246
thinking one foot out the door.
Don't think that way. Okay. What

1016
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:51,686
can you align? What kind of
projects can you align with

1017
00:52:51,686 --> 00:52:53,126
them?

1018
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:55,675
You know, to help them with
their go, but also help the

1019
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:57,055
company

1020
00:52:57,056 --> 00:52:59,681
reach their goals. You know,
granted you got competitive

1021
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:02,306
NDAs,

1022
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:03,611
all that stuff. I get that.
Yeah. Don't, developer's going

1023
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:04,916
to be an

1024
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:07,825
ad in that Sesame street. Don't
be, don't be mean bad and

1025
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:10,705
naughty

1026
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:15,925
go against your company, you
know, you know, you know, just

1027
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:19,945
try to align goals, like, like
I'm ambitious too, but I'm also

1028
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:25,016
looking for a job, but I said,
okay, Don't apply for any job

1029
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:28,135
that, that kind of like into
your competition world. know,

1030
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:31,225
flat for

1031
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:37,240
jobs you will want company to be
your. So your last dead there,

1032
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,055
you're, we're selling branding
our new relationship, right.

1033
00:53:39,055 --> 00:53:40,870
Kind

1034
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:44,081
of thing, where you want to
invest in those relationships at

1035
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:47,501
that company. So you don't want
to screw over people or burn

1036
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:51,190
bridges. You trying to have
strong ties. You're trying to

1037
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:55,481
make sure that people hit goals
because at the end of the day,

1038
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:57,206
get chance to hit yo goals. So
looking at it like that. So a

1039
00:53:57,206 --> 00:53:58,751
lot

1040
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:02,110
of times I really encourage
managers and both the talent to

1041
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:09,701
look at in that way. At it more
mutual benefiting because every

1042
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:12,791
relationship have is lifecycle.
Just like every product have is

1043
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:18,221
life cycle, development have his
life cycle. So of us like it's

1044
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,851
not there, just being more, um,
uh, um, be, just be more, um,

1045
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:25,481
uh,

1046
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,481
intense, uh, thoughtful,
thoughtful,

1047
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,471
Dan: I love that. I like, I
really like the framing of, you

1048
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,070
know, aligning goals, um, for,
for this sort of thing. So it's

1049
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,458
not like it gives you a good,
uh, Tool to conversation, you

1050
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,846
know,

1051
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,510
starter, you know what I mean?
So if you go into your manager

1052
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:44,905
or

1053
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:47,065
whatever, and you want to talk
about this, you don't just have

1054
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:49,525
to say I'm tired or whatever,
you know, I have too much work

1055
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,985
or

1056
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,710
whatever, like saying let's have
a conversation where we like

1057
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,435
work

1058
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:57,506
together and align our goals
together. I think that it's,

1059
00:54:57,506 --> 00:54:59,576
it's

1060
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,525
just, like you said, mutually
beneficial. I think that's, I

1061
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:02,365
think that's great advice.

1062
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,001
Helen: Yeah. Cause I talked to
my manager last week and it was

1063
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,325
like, yeah, I had one person.
Um, last one because they were

1064
00:55:07,325 --> 00:55:09,649
so

1065
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,201
tired, they was like, but they
also had another start-up and

1066
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:14,391
they didn't tell nobody about
it. And also my, how can I help

1067
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:16,581
you?

1068
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,380
You know? that's all on that
person a little bit. You're

1069
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,751
right. So, you know,

1070
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,800
Bekah: Well, I think like back
to what you were saying about

1071
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,081
acknowledging people where
they're at, like there are

1072
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:33,740
companies that make you afraid
to be doing your own projects or

1073
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,161
like want to claim your own
projects, right? Like, no I've

1074
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:39,981
been doing this thing on my own
time. Like this does not belong

1075
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:43,940
to you. And so having that
transparency and that clarity is

1076
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,610
super important making sure that
everybody succeeds, not just,

1077
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,280
you

1078
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,400
know, the company or the person,
like everybody succeeds when

1079
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,760
you're trans.

1080
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:55,536
Helen: Yeah, you got to
remember, companies are just

1081
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,351
like people. I

1082
00:55:57,351 --> 00:56:00,440
mean, you got mean people, you
got nice people, you got good

1083
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:06,260
people. You got, you know how
Holly that I, people you get all

1084
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,420
sorts of kinds of people and you
got that with companies. So if

1085
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,820
you decide to go with a company,
you know, they're very strict

1086
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:18,110
about that. You're making the
decision be like, okay, I gotta

1087
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:23,365
be in the closet. Um, I go and I
can't wait my flag and be proud

1088
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:26,065
about this, you know, kind of
thing. You, you make those

1089
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:29,755
choices, right. you could find
companies where, and you can do

1090
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:34,615
your own, um, D uh, diligent
research and see, do they have

1091
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,606
entrepreneurial people? Is there
anybody that work here and also

1092
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:42,356
have their own side project or
they own start up and they are,

1093
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:45,626
they open about it? Do they have
in their bio? I'm a founder of

1094
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:52,286
this and. Or do they just say, I
work at enterprise company, you

1095
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:56,126
know what I'm saying? They had
this incognito kind of phrases.

1096
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,825
So well, my views are not my
own. I seen so many of those in

1097
00:56:58,825 --> 00:57:00,895
the

1098
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:05,876
engineering manager, Twitter,
Twitter, bio. I'm like, wow. You

1099
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:07,585
know, there's some companies
like that, you know, you know,

1100
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:09,294
so you

1101
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:11,260
know, your own personality, you
know, what kind of, um, you

1102
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,225
know,

1103
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:16,383
whether you're. You know,
whether a company profile is

1104
00:57:16,383 --> 00:57:19,540
going to

1105
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,981
have you, um, filling out some
kind of facade or just living

1106
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:28,601
your own life, living your own
truth. So some companies I know

1107
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:31,721
I'll have to put on a facade. If
I say I have to, right. My views

1108
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:37,360
are my own. I know I'm screwed,
you know?

1109
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,550
Bekah: I feel that 100%. And I
just want to say, thank you so
