00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:09,103
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode three of

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:14,548
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,449
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,298
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:24,478
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:27,359
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,509
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:35,347
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we're
talking with Ayu Adiati. Ayu's

9
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:39,087
originally from Indonesia and now
based in the Netherlands. She's a

10
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,896
self-taught front end developer
and prolific technical blogger.

11
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:46,286
And she's on her way to break
into tech after being a stay at

12
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:50,097
home mom for her daughter for the
past four years. We talked with

13
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,877
Ayu about the impact of
community, being a blogger while

14
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:56,786
she's learning web development
and her recent experiences with

15
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:57,237
burnout.

16
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,591
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

17
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:03,292
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

18
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:07,581
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. Today's

19
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,932
random question is: "If you could
teleport to anywhere for 15

20
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:24,186
minutes, where would you go?" We
hope you enjoy this episode. Hey,

21
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:28,055
I'm Bekah. I am a front end
developer from a small town in

22
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:39,896
Ohio and I could teleport to
anywhere for 15 minutes. I don't,

23
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:44,156
I like, I can't decide if I want
like a nice, beautiful location

24
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:49,085
or if I want like really good
food. I, well, I don't know. I

25
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,695
don't have a really good specific
place, but I would go somewhere

26
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,896
that has a beautiful location
that has good food and drink. So

27
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:58,475
my answer.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Dan: I, uh, man, that just made
me start thinking like, okay,

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,490
well now I need to know the
rules. Can you take things with

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,480
you when you teleport back?

31
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,966
Bekah: You can do whatever you
want.

32
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,350
Dan: Okay.

33
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:10,825
Bekah: It's your

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,360
Dan: Um, I mean, it just changed
my whole. Alright. Hi. Um, hi,

35
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,281
I'm Dan. I am from Lakewood,
Ohio. Do front end development if

36
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:23,341
I could. So I was going to say
something. Uh, somewhere, maybe

37
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:27,360
like the top of Mount Everest or
somewhere where it's generally

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
like, not great to be, or the
it's really hard to get to, you

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,991
know, but it would be cool to
just like be there for 15

40
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,191
minutes, kind of see everything,
whatever. And by the time 15

41
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,411
minutes are up, um, you know,
oxygen deprivation is probably

42
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,431
setting in I'm pretty cold, so
I'm ready to go home. Um, but you

43
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,996
said food, which made me think,
okay, well, You know, can you

44
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:53,316
take things with you and in, so
maybe my answer is more like, you

45
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:53,975
know, Fort Knox

46
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,411
Bekah: bank.

47
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:59,126
Dan: and also have a bank, right.
Uh, somewhere else, you know,

48
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,105
other secret, and now I'm
thinking, oh, maybe there's like,

49
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:05,366
uh, like that secret room in the
library of Congress that was in,

50
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,665
um, you know, one of the national
treasure books, you know, or may

51
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:12,985
national treasure movies, um,
somewhere to like find a bunch of

52
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:17,181
secrets or something, you know,
anyway, um, I'm going to stick

53
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,912
with my original answer
officially as Mount Everest and,

54
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,562
um, we'll we can move on from
there.

55
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:29,356
Ayu: Hi, I'm Ayu and I'm front
end developer from, uh, Indonesia

56
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:34,546
or originally, but, uh, base in
Netherlands now. And if I can

57
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:40,391
teleport myself or 15 minutes, I
would split it into two. I would

58
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:45,401
visit the, my sister in Australia
and my brother in New Zealand.

59
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,792
That would be nice because we
haven't seen each other for

60
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,981
almost three years now.

61
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,681
Dan: Oh, wow.

62
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:52,967
Bekah: Wow.

63
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,842
Dan: Yeah, well, that's, that's a
good answer. I live too close to

64
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:56,711
all of my family, so

65
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,606
Bekah: My brother lives down the
street a little bit, literally

66
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:05,206
have run to my parents' house and
to my other brother's house. So

67
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:06,352
Ayu: That's

68
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,127
Bekah: not that

69
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,391
Dan: no, it's, it's nice. I w we
do it on purpose, but you know,

70
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,151
it's fine. I could take 15
minutes and probably get away

71
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,461
from them.

72
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,161
Bekah: Yeah, I like the take up
splitting that's. That was good.

73
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,889
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. There's

74
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,749
Bekah: Welcome. We are very happy
to have you here with us and for

75
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:27,809
everyone who is listening, just
want to say a special thank you

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,399
to Ayu because she's doing this
super late. Um, so we can make

77
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,608
sure that the time zones, um,
mashed up and we could get her on

78
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,918
here. So we are very, very happy
that this works.

79
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,468
Ayu: Thank you for having me.

80
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,428
Bekah: Um, we always like to
start with everyone's origin

81
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:48,329
story, kind of how they got to
this point where they're learning

82
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,459
tech or in tech. So if you could
just give us your background.

83
00:04:53,978 --> 00:05:01,853
Ayu: Well, I. Have a hobby as a
photography and it was starting

84
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:07,947
from my photography hobby. And I
did the freelancer for stock

85
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:12,987
photography. And then I have my
daughter and then when she starts

86
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:18,206
like one and half year, and it
becomes like really fun because

87
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:23,802
she start to, you know, uh, be
aware of the camera. Yeah, it's

88
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,771
it's from there. And then I
thought it would be nice if I

89
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,672
have like a blog or something,
like to have this personal

90
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:35,112
documentation. So I was like,
browsing anything about WordPress

91
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:41,802
or any blogging things, but then
I bumped into frequent camp and

92
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:48,911
then I just tried it. And from
there, I just like it. Yeah.

93
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:54,281
There's no going back from there.
It's like, I want to know more

94
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,601
and more and more. That's how I
finally got into coding.

95
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,387
Bekah: that. It's always so great
to hear how people discover it,

96
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,557
like through other things that
they've enjoyed doing. And then

97
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:11,007
it just kind of becomes something
that you want to do more and more

98
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,966
of. Um, so you said, you
mentioned free code camp. Is

99
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,627
that, um, how long did you stay
in free code camp or are you

100
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,687
still doing free code camp or,
you know, what are the resources

101
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,076
that you found really helpful?

102
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:28,411
Ayu: I actually not, I mean, like
for something that I learned for

103
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:32,971
the first time, I'm more an audio
visual person. So I like video

104
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:37,291
more. And so a friend of mine,
she was like, why don't you try

105
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:43,766
Udemy? So I start with Udemy and.
I like it. I mean, like when,

106
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,427
when I see, you know, like I see,
and then I, I code along with it

107
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:53,591
then, uh, it's just. Um, but they
still use free code camp to get

108
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,891
the certifications. Like you
don't have to finish all the

109
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:00,341
modules. Right. And you can just
jump into like, make all the

110
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,331
projects that, uh, that are
needed and, uh, finish, uh, uh,

111
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:10,161
certification. I did the first
certification, um, uh, web

112
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:18,206
responsive this design, I think.
Yeah, it was it. And yeah. I use,

113
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:24,387
uh, more physio, uh, from YouTube
or something like that. But after

114
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:29,547
I understand something, then I
can use the other resources, like

115
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:34,826
a blog articles or something like
that. Yeah. But for the first

116
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:35,817
time it's always video.

117
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,596
Bekah: I think that's great. And
it's always interesting to hear

118
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,117
the different approaches that
people take, because I know for

119
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:47,557
me, I can't watch the videos at
first. I'm the opposite. So I

120
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:52,257
need to read through it and then
I can watch the video, like what

121
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:56,007
is happening here. So it's, and
that's just another reason why

122
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:59,547
content creation in all forms can
be so great because everybody

123
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,937
learns differently and those
different approaches, um, one

124
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,716
works for me and one works for
you and something. Different

125
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:10,166
works for somebody else. And so
it's great to be able to have

126
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:10,706
that out there.

127
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:11,961
Ayu: Yeah. True.

128
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:17,817
Bekah: So Ayu, I think that I may
have known you longer than

129
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,617
anybody else at Virtual Coffee,

130
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:20,817
Ayu: Yeah, I think so, too.

131
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,627
Bekah: because I think I, I, I
met you shortly after I started

132
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:28,867
learning to code. I think we were
both doing, we were both in the

133
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:33,067
group, moms can code and that's
how we met. And we were both

134
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:38,707
learning to code with kids at
home. And as we all know, that

135
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:44,143
can be a challenge. Um, So, so
what, what was it like for, what

136
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:48,222
has it been like for you? Because
you are also, self-taught, you're

137
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:53,712
pursuing this, not in the
confines of a bootcamp or in a

138
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:58,033
traditional school setting and
you have a kid at home too, so

139
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,523
there's just a lot of different
moving pieces there.

140
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:06,033
Ayu: Yeah. I start to, uh, learn
to code when she was, uh, my

141
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:12,457
daughter was. Two years old and,
uh, I was self-taught and then,

142
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:18,623
uh, I think that I tweeted, I
tweeted one time. How to juggling

143
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:25,072
between the house chores and the
kid, and also, uh, learning. And

144
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:29,962
then I remember that one of, uh,
who were response to my tweet was

145
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:33,643
you back out, so yeah. And you
said you join mom and then it's

146
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:38,802
like, oh, there's a moment. Cool.
That's nice. You know, so yeah.

147
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:45,173
Yeah, I joined it, but yeah, with
the time differences. I got more

148
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:54,222
coworking with the European times
on moms and we. Hmm, learning,

149
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:59,312
uh, things that are different.
One to another, like, uh, one is

150
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,273
like doing in the back end and
the other is the front end, but I

151
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:06,753
mean, like that's for the first
time that I felt like I'm not

152
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:10,052
alone, you know, like, I don't
care what they're doing, but it's

153
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:14,403
like, I'm not, I'm not learning
by myself. And I, we can have

154
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:19,673
like all our, our kids. You know,
my kids were crying and then they

155
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:23,153
were like, Hey, stop it there or
something like that. But yeah,

156
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:30,023
it's, it's not easy. And, um,
when she was two, my, um, the

157
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:35,408
time for me to learn was only on
her neck. And then I have to wait

158
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:38,467
until the whole house is
sleeping, like around them at

159
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,628
night. And then I start learning
from that until 12 one in the

160
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:49,717
morning. And yeah, uh, it's
getting easier now after she

161
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:54,908
start with her elementary school,
but it was like, hell before.

162
00:10:55,148 --> 00:11:02,602
It's like, I, I couldn't find any
perfect time to learn and. Two

163
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:08,332
hours in total for the whole
learning. So, yeah. So I cannot

164
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,582
imagine that you have four,
Bekah, you still.

165
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:18,577
Bekah: You know, it was one of
those things. Where you start to

166
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,807
get used to being able to pivot
pretty quickly like, oh, my kids

167
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,477
are playing, I'm going to sit
down at this computer. And then

168
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,238
my mind would just like switch
on, like, it knew it has to do it

169
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:33,128
right in this second. But, you
know, I had a lot of help from my

170
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:36,817
parents would watch the kids or
if I had a project to do, I

171
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,427
remember one weekend, my husband
was out of town speaking at a

172
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:43,087
conference. And so they took the
kids and it was the same thing

173
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,097
like you were talking about.
You're just trying to. Fit in

174
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:51,168
this time. And so I stayed up so
late and then woke up the next

175
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,738
morning to try and get it done.
Cause you're trying to fit it in.

176
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:59,493
But at the same time, you don't
want to be formal. Bad self care

177
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:05,013
habits, because then that just
leads to frustration and not

178
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:08,462
wanting to do the thing that you
want to do. And then being mad

179
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,952
that you don't want to do the
thing that you know, you want to

180
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:17,283
do. Right. Um, so it's all, it's
a whole, I don't know, thing to

181
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,442
juggle and it's not just about
learning. It's about. You know,

182
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:25,373
the growth and the changes that
you're facing yourself. And it's

183
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,852
a different role that you're
taking on and trying to figure

184
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:33,952
out how all these things work
together. And so it can be really

185
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:37,283
great, but certainly it can be
really frustrating.

186
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:41,317
Ayu: True. True. And especially
that I don't have my family here.

187
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:45,727
Right. And my husband works, so I
have to do everything by myself.

188
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:50,817
So yeah. It's like, and people
said that, oh, you have like lots

189
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:55,227
of time because you only stay at
home. And, oh my God, I feel like

190
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,518
I want to cry every time I hear
that because no, if we can have

191
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:04,288
like more than 24 hours in a day,
that wouldn't be perfect, you

192
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,602
know? But we don't

193
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,942
Bekah: Yeah. I always say that's
like my biggest challenge.

194
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,562
There's not 36 hours in a day.

195
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:11,243
Ayu: Yeah.

196
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:17,857
Dan: I imagine it at least,
knowing you, I, if you had 36

197
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,717
hours in a day, you would find a
way to fill all of that. And

198
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:25,087
still that's still what you wish
there was more. Yeah, it's just a

199
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:25,812
Bekah: accurate.

200
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:31,582
Dan: Uh, Yeah, it's that, that
switch off. I mean, we, my kids

201
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:34,722
are in daycare, you know, my wife
and I both work. But during the

202
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:37,903
pandemic, you know, at the
beginning, um, everything was

203
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,793
shut down. Daycare was shut down,
you know? And so we were trying

204
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:43,062
to do that. We're trying to
juggle the kids and work and, you

205
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:47,113
know, uh, Emily, I would switch
off, you know, watching the kids

206
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:52,467
and, um, For me, that for me, I
struggled really hard with that

207
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,748
context. Switching like Bekah,
you said you got, you got good at

208
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:58,557
it. That was really very hard for
me, you know? Like, um, and

209
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,738
honestly it was less some, it
wasn't that you sitting down at

210
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,207
the computer part, it was the,
the going back from computer to

211
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:10,378
kids switch. That was the, that
was a struggle for me. Um, you

212
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:15,067
know, I, I just have so much
respect for people who are

213
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,847
parenting like full-time and
trying to learn or work like

214
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,878
through all this I, that I don't
know how you do it, but it seems

215
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,107
like you've been managing it.

216
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,057
Ayu: I don't know. I still don't
know how to do it Dan. I don't

217
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:27,177
know.

218
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,967
Bekah: it's the truth too. I
mean, people will ask, like, how

219
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:36,118
do you do it? I don't know, you
know, you just do the things that

220
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,827
you, you have to do.

221
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,707
Ayu: Yeah, exactly.

222
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,422
Bekah: We talked about these
frustrations that can be that

223
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,241
you're facing that we're all
facing as we're learning these

224
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,572
things and as we're parenting and
going through a global pandemic

225
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:54,792
together. And, and so I think.
Sometimes, really leaning into

226
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:59,981
the things that encourage us or
inspire us can be really useful.

227
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:04,001
Have there been things or people
along the way that you found have

228
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:09,162
helped you continue the journey
or, um, prevented you from giving

229
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,392
up and maybe some of those times
that were really hard

230
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:17,154
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, I got
burned out like so many times.

231
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:23,815
Right. And, and, um, well, I've
been active on Twitter and that

232
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:30,065
helps, uh, I'm doing the, um, A
hundred codes of challenge. And,

233
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,235
uh, um, every time I sit like, oh
my God, I don't know what to do.

234
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:37,475
And then some people like random
people, like, no, you can do

235
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:43,195
this. And yeah, I got, I get my
spirit back and. There are also

236
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:46,764
times, especially when you were a
self-taught. Right. And you, you

237
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:51,504
don't, you don't have anybody to
talk with. Like my husband, he

238
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:55,465
doesn't know anything about web
dev, so I can not like, oh, I'm

239
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,884
having trouble with this code.
And he was like, what, what do

240
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:04,434
you mean? Correct. So, yeah, I
mean, uh, I got the one time burn

241
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:10,774
out. Like that's pretty recently
that I think. Okay. I don't think

242
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:14,705
that this is for me and like, I'm
going to, I'm going to just quit.

243
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:21,264
And I was like, I got so, so
surprise actually with, with that

244
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:24,205
thoughts, because I never thought
like, yeah, I got burnt out, but

245
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:28,315
then like, uh, uh, you know, like
I'm taking break and stuff and I

246
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,924
would be fine again, but this
time it's like different. I

247
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:35,995
already took break. I mean, like
I already procrastinated, but

248
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:41,240
still. I don't know how to get
myself together this time. Like,

249
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,639
uh, I got panic attack. It was
like, I learn. And then one time,

250
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,720
like we were having this, uh, Uh,
theme, right? I I'm trying with

251
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,500
some VC members to have this, uh,
group project about vanilla

252
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,179
JavaScript. I mean, I got burned
out with react with learning

253
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,329
react before, and then I thought,
oh, this is a good chance because

254
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,180
it's funny, like JavaScript. So I
can like take a step back and

255
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,210
then do what I know, you know,
but because so far I learned by

256
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,960
myself doing everything by
myself. When it's in a group,

257
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,019
it's a different story, right?
You have somebody else to

258
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:24,190
collaborate and everybody has
their own thoughts, like on how

259
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,349
to approach something, which is
not the approach that I probably

260
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,380
would take, so it's kind of made
me confused and then I got like

261
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,150
so freaked out and I was like,
What is happening, where are we

262
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,720
in? I don't know. My God, this is
funny, like JavaScript. And I've

263
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,710
done this like so many times, but
how come I'm not following this?

264
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,509
You know, it's like, I cannot do
it. And this feels like I want to

265
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:56,460
stop. So I kind of pull myself a
little bit off from everybody for

266
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,480
like a week or so. But then I
thought like, no, I need to talk

267
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,160
to someone about this. Right. So
I start to talk to some of my

268
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,630
friends and they were all like,
okay, we are all struggling. Like

269
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,980
you can do this. And then like
one of them even say to them,

270
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:19,424
It's actually good that you, you
have that thought of quitting

271
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,934
because you don't understand
things because if you have that

272
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,755
thought, it means that, you know,
so many things, so you get

273
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:29,525
confused, you know, it's not like
you don't know anything, like

274
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:35,315
yeah, you're right. I was like,
okay. And that's, you know, like

275
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,775
people don't want to share
they're struggling. Right. I

276
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,490
don't know. Maybe because. Um,
they don't want people to think

277
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,490
they're weak or I don't know.
They, they have their own

278
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:55,259
reasons. As for me, I feel more
or less embarrassed. Like I've

279
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,220
been learning for so long and
then suddenly, like, I know

280
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,609
nothing, you know, and I don't, I
just don't want to share that. If

281
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,970
I really want to do this, I want
to step forward. Then I think

282
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,250
that I should share this struggle
with at least, uh, somebody that

283
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,380
can, that I know that can hear me
out. Listen to me, you know? And

284
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,420
it was a good decision that I
made that I just, you know, share

285
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,319
here are my struggles. And then
people support me. I mean, like

286
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,289
if you, if you don't share,
nobody knows and you just have to

287
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:37,184
deal it yourself. Yeah. It's,
it's been a journey.

288
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,579
Dan: Yeah.

289
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,275
Bekah: Certainly a journey. You
said some things in there that

290
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:46,055
that really struck me. And so you
talked about this idea of

291
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:50,194
community and isolation and
sharing, and I think that, you

292
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,505
know, all of these things go
together and especially when

293
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:56,464
we're in those. Tough moments
where we tend to isolate from

294
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,734
other people, for those reasons
that you spoke about, you know,

295
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,605
it's self doubt and not thinking
you can do it and being

296
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,325
embarrassed or afraid to share
things. And I got a piece of

297
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:10,904
advice pretty early on from
someone and they said, Um, you

298
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,904
don't share it for your show
yourself. You share for other

299
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:17,295
people because other people who
are going through the same things

300
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:20,894
can recognize that, oh, I don't
have to do this in isolation. I'm

301
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,595
not the only one that feels this
way. And then that's how

302
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:27,434
community is formed. And I just
always loved that idea because it

303
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,875
can be so hard to share those
things and to feel alone and to

304
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:36,630
feel like. I dunno, you're you're
not where you should be. Right.

305
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,190
Like, I it's, it happens every
week. I look at someone else and

306
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,119
I'm like, oh wow. I, I should, I
should be able to know what

307
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,940
they're talking about. And I
don't. Right. And then it's like,

308
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,519
oh, don't fall into the
comparison trap, number one. But

309
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:54,240
number two, like embrace that
community of people that's around

310
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,329
you. And you know, for me, I
you've been such a huge part of

311
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:02,154
my community and I don't know how
you do it, but I feel like. There

312
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:06,775
are times when I am really,
really struggling and I won't say

313
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,255
anything. And then I get a DM
from you checking on me and I'm

314
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:15,684
like, oh, okay. Like I use here.
This is what I needed, you know?

315
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:20,424
And so for me, that's been such
a, um, uh, an important piece of,

316
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:23,484
of all of the things that have
happened to me since I met you,

317
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:27,355
because it's nice to have that
connection. And to know that

318
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:30,924
there are people that are, are,
are willing to, to care about

319
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,015
you.

320
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,184
Ayu: And, and I learned so much
from, from, uh, your trauma

321
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:41,375
stories, spectrum, and like,
you've been so open. Right. And,

322
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,105
and you reach so many people with
your story. And, and I mean,

323
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:51,734
like, there are plenty of people
there that. Have the same feeling

324
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,825
like how you feel, but they
cannot let it out. So I thought

325
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,914
like when, when I was struggling,
I thought like, okay, this is

326
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:02,595
for, for me, for myself, you
know, I mean, like, and, and, uh,

327
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,464
I also think that maybe I'm not
the only one, maybe, maybe

328
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:10,365
there's also people out there
that having the struggle the same

329
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:14,444
as I do. And if I open up, maybe
those people can open up as well

330
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:17,444
and they, and they could like
feel a little bit relieved that,

331
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,835
okay. I'm not the only one. And
I, I can, I can talk about it.

332
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:25,875
Like it's, it's okay to not feel
okay. You know, so yeah. I thank

333
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,775
you so much because you taught me
how to do that.

334
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,244
Bekah: No, I'm going to cry.

335
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,710
Dan: You, you talked about
sharing, you know, your story,

336
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,549
especially regarding the burnout
and, you know, the we'll post on

337
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,299
the, on the show notes, but you
wrote a really great piece about

338
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,390
it. Um, but two week, a couple
weeks ago or a week ago, whatever

339
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,920
it was. And, um, I, uh, I, I just
wanted to call it out because I,

340
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,759
I love to reading it. And I loved
that. Uh, you know, you shared,

341
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,119
you shared the struggle part,
which is. I agree is very

342
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,750
important and very helpful for
people. Um, but I, I very much

343
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,859
loved how you, um, a lot of the
article is more about how to

344
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,559
survive it, you know, how, how to
sort of recognize those feelings

345
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,490
for what they are and then how to
sort of survive and move on. And,

346
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,329
um, I just really appreciated it.
I don't I don't have I don't

347
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,700
really have a question or a
point, but, but I appreciated it.

348
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,809
I mean, you know, it, and a lot
of it is just the, um, allowing

349
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:33,075
yourself to. Be not okay. Or
whatever, allow yourself to take

350
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:38,234
a break or step back. Um, and I
think it's so important. Um, it

351
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,015
was, it was a good.

352
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:44,065
Ayu: self care is really, really
important. I mean, like, this is

353
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:47,875
like one point in my, in my
learning journey where I really,

354
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:52,134
really want to rush things, you
know, like, um, I've been

355
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:57,720
learning for. Two years, two and
half years now. And I feel like,

356
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,839
why am I so slow? So I'm trying
to, you know, speed up a bit. But

357
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,890
I think like, because I start to
understand things, so I really

358
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:14,369
want to speed up again, speed up
again. But I didn't, I, you can

359
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,349
say that I ignore my. Well, I
should take a break, but I don't

360
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:24,309
because no, I want to be in this
momentum, you know, like I, I

361
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,299
want to keep it up, but now this
is my limit to take a break for a

362
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,970
bit, but I didn't. So I think
that's where most people also

363
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:39,230
don't aware where they really
want to push and push and push

364
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,869
forward. Um, they need to, you
know, like take a step back and

365
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,339
just refute the center's slowing
down a bit, then they don't think

366
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,220
about themselves, you know, like,
like, um, they can get burnout or

367
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:03,569
can get frustration. So, yeah. My
experience skin, like reminding

368
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:09,029
people as well, that the, they
need to, you know, take a step

369
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,470
back once in a while.

370
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,809
Dan: Yeah, it's hard to do or it
can be, you know, it can't be

371
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,809
hard to do. Um, at least in my
personal experience.

372
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,559
Bekah: Well, and I think too,
when you take that step back,

373
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,799
sometimes it's hard to get
started again. Right? There's

374
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,269
this fear of losing momentum,
like, well, I was there and you

375
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,470
have to backtrack a little bit if
you take a break. And so for a

376
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,529
lot of people, I think it's, I
don't know. Exactly how to

377
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,500
describe that feeling, whether
it's being upset with themselves

378
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,250
or having to go back or getting,
being hard on yourself and

379
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,519
thinking like, well, I should
know this stuff. Right. But it's

380
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,950
okay to have to backtrack. It's
okay. To start from a different

381
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,275
point that you ended up. But I
think, like you're saying,

382
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:02,964
there's just not that many people
that are talking about those

383
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:07,644
things, you know, it is okay to
take a break. It is okay to be at

384
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:11,694
a different point than someone
else's going to be. And I don't

385
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:15,025
know this is going to sound
silly, but I always used to

386
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,894
compare myself to Kent C Dodds,
which is like, not fair in any

387
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,535
way, shape or form. Cause he's
been doing this a long time, but

388
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:25,375
I'm like, he's got four kids. How
come he can do all this stuff.

389
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:30,019
Right? Like what. It's a little
bit different. He actually, he

390
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,650
wrote a newsletter for mother's
day, one year. I think that

391
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,490
talked about how much his wife
does to support him and their

392
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,559
kids. And it was like, oh, okay.
I get, I get this right? Like

393
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,740
there's a lot of support for the
things that he's doing and he's

394
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,045
been doing it a really long time.
And it's. A reasonable

395
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:53,345
comparison. I'm not really that
reasonable, so it's not

396
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:59,464
surprising that I would do that.
But, um, it's not even like, look

397
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:03,154
at the people who are learning
alongside you. It should never,

398
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:07,595
if that's the motivation, then
there's always going to be a

399
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:10,865
point where you start to really
get down on yourself because

400
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:14,734
everybody moves in different ways
and in different paces. And you

401
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,950
know, sometimes you'll hit a
plateau. And it'll be really hard

402
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,359
to get back up like the mountain.
Um, but then, but then you'll

403
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,765
gain some momentum and then
you'll go fast again. Right. You

404
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:30,724
know, maybe your, your study all
the time, everybody learns

405
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,805
differently. Everybody, um, can
apply things in different ways

406
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,525
and has different strengths. And
I think we just failed to

407
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:43,025
recognize that complexity and we
try and make it this really

408
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:48,875
simple story of success. And we
forget all of the, you know,

409
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,964
things about being human that go
along with that story.

410
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,480
Ayu: Yeah, true. And I kind of
forget that. I mean, like I was

411
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,259
thinking I'm learning for two,
two and a half years and, uh,

412
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,664
I'm, I'm going so slow, but I
forgot that. Most of the days, I

413
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:14,825
only have two until three hours a
day to learn. Right. So I cannot

414
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:19,984
compare myself to someone who can
spend like more than five hours a

415
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:24,384
day to learn. So, um, yeah, I
need to remind myself that

416
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:25,214
Dan: Okay.

417
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:30,529
Ayu: You're, you're going
forward. Only that you have like

418
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,410
less time than other people. So
you cannot compare yourself to

419
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,660
other people, but this is your
time. Right? I mean, I do, uh,

420
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,849
the best way. I mean, like the
best that I could within two and

421
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,269
three hours a day, and that's
actually good, you know, like

422
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:52,339
when I got exhausted, I still
can, um, save some time to learn.

423
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:57,605
So I think. Uh, I've been too
hard on myself or something like

424
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:03,335
that and not appreciate myself. I
don't know. But yeah, I'm trying

425
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:07,684
to remind me myself about that.
Like You're, you're doing good.

426
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,444
You're you're doing okay. You
know, so.

427
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,680
Dan: Yeah, I, I mean, you are,
you're doing great. I can't, uh,

428
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,170
trying to fit that learning and,
and it's not just the hours,

429
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,779
right. Is you've talked. You were
talking about how it's like a

430
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:25,990
little bit during nap time and
then late at night. Um,

431
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,599
Ayu: Yeah,

432
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,740
Dan: Which probably not the best,
you know, your brain's probably

433
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,450
not in the best shape for
learning at that point either.

434
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,210
Right. And so that's what I mean
here. You know, you're, you're,

435
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,019
you're working with what you
have. Um, and the progress you've

436
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,599
made seems I don't know what to
say from where I'm sitting. It

437
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,210
seems incredible. Um, you've also
been just a prolific blogger,

438
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,759
like over the last, however long,
a couple of years. Uh, and I've

439
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,450
always been, I mean, like that.
Yeah. I don't know, I've read. I

440
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,430
think probably most of everything
you've written, but like it's,

441
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,049
it's, uh, very impressive. I was
wondering how you approach, like

442
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,920
mixing that into your normal
routine of like learning and

443
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,490
stuff like that.

444
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,630
Ayu: No blogging is, is
completely different thing. I

445
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,210
mean, like I really have to, uh,
make a time to write a blog and

446
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,390
English is not my native, right.
So I'm not native English

447
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,359
speakers. So, I mean, I need like
three to four hours to arrive.

448
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,660
600 to 800 words. And you imagine
so. Yeah, mostly like when I do

449
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,960
blogging, um, if I have an idea,
I will do the bullet points and

450
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,960
then from there, then I will try
to, uh, you know, like talk about

451
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,109
the bullet points, little bit,
like explanation, something like

452
00:30:51,109 --> 00:31:02,599
that. Uh, it, it helps me to, to,
um, Uh, a little bit faster. And

453
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:06,980
if you see like my block style,
most of them always have like the

454
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,119
bullet points.

455
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:08,964
Dan: Okay.

456
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,200
Bekah: Well, I think that's great
for readers do.

457
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,224
Dan: I think it's a really
effective way to, to write.

458
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:17,375
Absolutely. Um, that's how I,
that's how I usually write the,

459
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:21,904
when I blog once a year. Um, I
did the same thing, uh, as

460
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,865
opposed to once a week. Um, yeah,
for me it's once a year maybe,

461
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:30,214
but, uh, I, I, I've just, I'm
impressed, especially on a

462
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:35,105
limited time schedule. Like you
have, um, that you have both the.

463
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,390
I don't know the dedication, the
willpower, you know, to, to, to

464
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,009
do the blogging because it's, I
it's optional. Right. Nobody's

465
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:47,269
making you do it, or it's not
like part of any of your, I don't

466
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,579
know, certifications or anything
like that. Right. And so you're,

467
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:55,309
you're, um, you're just doing it
on your own and it's impressive.

468
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,559
Like blogging is one of those
things where I'm always like,

469
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,009
yes, this month I'm going to get
into the habit, you know? And it

470
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,809
never happens because it's,
nobody's making, you know, you

471
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,029
know, nobody's asking me to write
on my own on my own website. So.

472
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:07,654
I'm always impressed by people
who can.

473
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:12,494
Ayu: the, it's actually one of
the things that get me into

474
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:17,505
learning to code as well,
because, uh, besides that I want

475
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:24,214
to, um, uh, have my, uh, photos
showcase. I also want to. Wanted

476
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:29,255
to write about my experience,
like living, living in another

477
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:35,855
country and with a toddler and
stuffs. Um, but I finally didn't

478
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:43,174
write anything until thank you
for DC for having that a monthly

479
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:48,484
challenge of November, where we
have to write. Right. And it's

480
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:53,525
actually, that's one of the
things that can. Hmm. Uh, how do

481
00:32:53,525 --> 00:33:00,125
you say, uh, uh, how do you say
that accountable? Make me

482
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:05,615
accountable. Hold me accountable.
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, when we do

483
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:09,934
something together, right. And
then like, yeah, everybody's

484
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:13,414
like, oh, I already wrote this
and I wrote this and I was like,

485
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:16,595
oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to
do that. You know, like it's,

486
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:23,105
it's fun and yeah. Even after
the, the monthly challenge, then

487
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:28,265
I was still like in my, uh, you
know, I was like in my mood to,

488
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:33,224
to, to write. And that's why I
keep writing, but it's

489
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,970
Dan: That's awesome.

490
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,545
Ayu: all PC.

491
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,710
Dan: from VC

492
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:40,865
Bekah: As in November, we ran our
first monthly challenge and that

493
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:45,244
was, um, November is NaNoWriMo.
So national novel writing month.

494
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:50,075
And the goal is to write 50,000
words, which is about the size of

495
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:54,244
a novel. And so we said, Hey, why
don't we all work together and

496
00:33:54,244 --> 00:34:00,125
try and pick, get hit 50,000
words this month writing and

497
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,234
adding to our blogs.

498
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,154
Dan: Like collectively,

499
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:04,625
Bekah: Yes, not individually.

500
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:04,894
Dan: right.

501
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:09,844
Bekah: Um, and it turned out to
be a lot of fun. It was kind of a

502
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:15,500
last minute thing. And a lot of
people participated. A lot of

503
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,389
people were writing for the first
time and we didn't hit 50,000,

504
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,789
but I think, you know, we didn't
really gear up either. It was

505
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:24,550
like, okay, we're going to do
this. But I really think this

506
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,989
November we could hit 50,000
words and it'll be a lot of fun.

507
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,130
It was great to see everybody
sharing and asking for feedback

508
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:39,394
and, and getting like new and
exciting ideas out there. Um, But

509
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,275
I also want to bring up, so
you're writing across platforms

510
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,264
and not only that, but you're
like recognized on all of the

511
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:49,835
platforms that you're writing on.
Like you're consistently one of

512
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:56,914
the top bloggers in, um, you were
recognized, well, why don't you

513
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:00,815
talk about that first or get
ahead of myself. I'm so excited

514
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:05,780
about it. Um, Writing on all of
these different platforms and

515
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,150
your choice to do that. And you
know, how, how are I want to say

516
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,579
that? I don't think you give
yourself enough credit, right?

517
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,730
Because everybody is giving you
credit here and saying like, I,

518
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,150
you is an amazing writer and all
these ways. And.

519
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,489
Ayu: No. I mean, like I w I
write, because I want to write,

520
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,780
right. It was, it was only for
the sake of the monthly challenge

521
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,300
at the beginning. And I don't
have any, you know, like a

522
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,860
website or something like that.
So I started with a platform of

523
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:48,679
hashed note where I can have my
own, um, Uh, address, but, uh, I

524
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,719
can use their platform. And then
from there I cross posted two

525
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,219
deaths and then, uh, and then
there's a code newbie, and then I

526
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:03,860
cross posit as well to go newbie.
I never think about like gaming.

527
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:09,550
Defending readers or something
like that, because I thought, I

528
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:16,460
even thought that no one will
ever read my blog and I write, I

529
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,619
write the blog posts purely only
for myself, you know? Like I want

530
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,260
to have my notes out there
because my notes are so

531
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:32,050
cluttering and, uh, I want to,
uh, look back to it and yeah. I

532
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,289
would write for myself that that
was the first thing. So I didn't

533
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,449
even know like, like when you say
back, I like, oh, how do you do

534
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:44,619
that? I have no idea. I mean,
like, I never even thought that

535
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,449
one with read, so

536
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:52,960
Bekah: Well, everyone is reading.
And also you were one of the code

537
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,579
newbie spotlights in April. Yeah.
April. You were a code newbie.

538
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:00,130
Spotlight. Talk a little bit
about that. Cause that's awesome.

539
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:06,184
Ayu: Yeah. I mean, like, it was a
nice surprise. Um, Code Newbie,

540
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:13,835
like sent me a DM on Twitter and
Hey, do you want to be our April

541
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:17,405
spotlight? And I was like, oh
yeah, sure. Like, how come

542
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:17,719
Dan: Yeah.

543
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:27,139
Ayu: I have no idea? Like, it's,
it's a big surprise and yeah. So

544
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,469
that

545
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:27,659
Bekah: Yeah.

546
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,099
Ayu: was pretty much about it. I
mean, like, I, I didn't see that

547
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,150
it's coming, you know,

548
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,079
Bekah: I mean, I just love that.
I love the picture of you and

549
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,960
your mom in, in that spotlight.
It's just such a beautiful way to

550
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,769
kind of end that there. And,
know, I don't, I don't know if

551
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,349
you want to say anything about
your mom, but I know that she was

552
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:49,619
a big

553
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,949
Ayu: Yeah, Yeah, yeah, It's, it's
actually, it's actually. Um, kind

554
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:00,949
of, kind of nice story. I think
like, uh, my mom, we were, we

555
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,010
were really like best friend. I
mean, like we were really close

556
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:13,130
and, um, she suddenly got, uh,
diagnosed with auto-immune. Um,

557
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,710
it's actually pretty much, uh,
maintainable, if you have like a

558
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,690
good medicine, right. And one of
it is like steroids, but at that

559
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:30,289
time in, in, uh, where, uh, where
she lived, uh that's, there's not

560
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,760
enough staff. So she got worse
and worse and worse, like really

561
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,340
fast. So, uh, like one day, and
she didn't want to receive my

562
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,760
call for like a couple of weeks,
because she was like, so in so

563
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,550
bad, bad condition and she didn't
want to say anything, but one

564
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,364
time, like finally she received
my phone call and then. I told

565
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,804
her, like, we talk a lot with, we
talk almost two hours so that

566
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:03,385
they, um, uh, I told her like,
Hey, I want to, uh, participate

567
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:08,514
in this, uh, photography, um, you
know, photography challenge. And

568
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:13,945
if I won, I said, uh, then, then
I would be like, in this magazine

569
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:18,659
in Germany. Yeah. And they, they
would pick up like 20, 20

570
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:24,360
pictures and the top winner would
be like, uh, going into the

571
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,860
magazine in Germany and just
like, oh, you should make me as

572
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,570
your model. You know? And I think
that you would win with my, with

573
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,829
my foot on it. And I really want
to see you on the magazine. I was

574
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:45,875
like, yeah. All right. I didn't
even get into the, the talent of

575
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:51,275
the photography. And, uh, like
not long after that, it's like

576
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:56,135
the week or two weeks, something
like that. Then, um, I got a

577
00:39:56,135 --> 00:40:00,695
phone call from my arm, uh, and
she said like, I think that he

578
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:06,065
should go. All of you are like me
and my siblings. You all should

579
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:09,664
go back because like, she's
getting worse. And we're like,

580
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:14,824
oh, okay. So we flew, right. We
flew there. And after I was

581
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:21,215
there, five days late, later she
passed away. So I didn't, I

582
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:25,684
didn't get into a day magazine of
course, because I didn't, I

583
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:33,574
didn't, uh, Participate in, in
the photography challenge and

584
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:39,335
with this called newbie. And
suddenly now, after, after the,

585
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:44,945
uh, my profile got into prose
work called Nubian, then I

586
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,724
remember this, you know, like
this conversation, like when she

587
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:55,610
said, I want to see you on that
magazine and this time. It's not

588
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,929
the magazine, but I mean, like I
want an article and that's me,

589
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,699
that's me there. And that's why I
took my mom picture there because

590
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,929
like, Hey, mom is like, you're
there now? You know, like it's

591
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:12,230
not, it's not on the photography
thing that we talk about, but

592
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,480
there on, on my, uh, on an
article about me. So yeah, I hope

593
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:17,570
that.

594
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:24,514
Bekah: It's such a beautiful
story and it's so nice to hear

595
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:28,925
you share it and to talk about
your mom and, and, and that

596
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:32,974
support and to see how it just
all kind of come around and, you

597
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:40,804
know, um, yeah. I just, just
really, really beautiful.

598
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,420
Ayu: Yeah. I just hope that she
proud of

599
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:45,625
Dan: Okay.

600
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,570
Ayu: I mean, like, Yeah.

601
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:52,349
Bekah: Okay. I mean, are you,
you're doing so much. I mean,

602
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:55,320
you're taking care of your
daughter, you're learning, you're

603
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:02,550
bringing up, helping so much with
the community and being such a, a

604
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,530
great person to have in our
community and to, you know, have

605
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,710
your support and all of the
things that you share. And, you

606
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,269
know, you've, you've touched so
many lives. So I feel like she,

607
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,769
most definitely is proud of that.

608
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,269
Ayu: Thank you. Thank you so
much. And I'm, I'm, I'm very,

609
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,289
very grateful to find, uh,
fertile coffee, to be honest, and

610
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:32,449
like, thank you back that Dan and
Kirk and Sara and yeah, everybody

611
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:37,139
in VC, like very, very supportive
and very, very loving. I mean,

612
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,989
like this is the first time that
I feel like I'm not alone, not

613
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,269
only in the journey of learning,
but VC is more like a family to

614
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:51,480
me. And even though we haven't
met in real life, but I feel like

615
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:57,420
I'm so close to everyone as if
like, yeah, I, I I've met you all

616
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,800
for a thousand years, so yeah.

617
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,219
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's been
my experience too. You know, I

618
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,730
always struggled with finding
friends and fitting in and kind

619
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,269
of understanding like my place in
things. And it's just been really

620
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,969
nice to be able to share that
with other people and for other

621
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:25,614
people too, except except me
where I'm at in that. Place and,

622
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,974
and to be able to talk about
things more openly, because I

623
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:32,034
don't know if, if he knew me five
years ago, I'm a much different

624
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,945
person than I was. And before I
never would have shared any of

625
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,795
that, I just would've like
bottled it all up, but it's nice

626
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:41,244
to have a community that you feel
safe and supported with and to be

627
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,914
able to talk about those things
like, wow, I'm just really,

628
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:48,184
really having a tough day today.
You know, and, and just to even

629
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,885
just somebody giving me a heart
emoji is like, sometimes that's

630
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:54,275
all I need. I just need someone
to acknowledge that I am having a

631
00:43:54,275 --> 00:44:00,155
hard day. Um, and it's, and it's
just a really special place. I

632
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:01,894
haven't found anything else like
that.

633
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:09,300
Ayu: True. True. I feel, I feel
the same. I mean, like when was I

634
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,565
find Virtual coffee, it was from
your tweet, right, Bekah?. Hey,

635
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:19,425
I'm having this, uh, Virtual
coffee and, uh, you, uh, you post

636
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:25,965
the slack, the slack link, and I
did join the slack, but I wasn't

637
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:29,985
saying anything at all. And I was
like, I don't know. I mean, like

638
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:35,344
I'm still learning. All people
here already developer, you know,

639
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:42,425
and I got, how can I, I, I didn't
even dare to say hi. I was like,

640
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:51,215
oh my God, who am I? You know?
But yeah. So I finally, after, I

641
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:55,534
don't know, a couple of months I
seen and finally. I say hi and

642
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:59,764
introduce myself, uh, in the
slack. And then I went to the

643
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,875
meeting for the first time when I
was like, no, everybody's like so

644
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:08,525
nice. And everybody's like, maybe
already have more than 10 years

645
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:12,425
experience, but they're still
like so humble and so caring. And

646
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:17,405
I was like, yes, I think I know
that I'm in the right. In a

647
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:20,344
heartbeat. I just know that,
yeah, this is, this is my

648
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:26,605
community, you know? Right. Nice.
It's always nice to be in VC like

649
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:31,465
you can see me almost every day
on slack. Oh, sorry for that.

650
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:33,114
come up. Help it.

651
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Dan: Oh, we are certainly glad
you are here. Um, in slack and,

652
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:47,539
and at the meetings. Uh it's it's
I don't know. It's always good to

653
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:48,050
see you there

654
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:54,925
Ayu: Oh, oh one time. Like, uh, I
usually like do co-work at

655
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,465
nights, right? Because I've
learned at night and most of the

656
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,909
time. I cannot really talk
because my husband and my thing,

657
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,440
my daughter's super sensitive to
voices. But the, for today I

658
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,139
already told my husband, like,
don't get bothered because I'm

659
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:16,440
going to talk loud. And yeah. So
usually in the coworking channel,

660
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,719
like people don't really hear my
voice because I always typing,

661
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,550
like people say something that
has weight, right. And then one

662
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:34,119
time Glenn. I will give ten bucks
to anybody who can make her talk

663
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,329
because I never hear her voice.

664
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:41,594
Dan: That's amazing.

665
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,065
Bekah: That is so funny.

666
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:46,269
Ayu: Yeah.

667
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,394
Dan: Now we can just send him
this podcast episode, Right.

668
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:51,235
Bekah: That's right. Who gets a
10 bucks.

669
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:53,534
Dan: Oh, yeah. Who gets it? That
we'll split it.

670
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:54,235
Bekah: Okay.

671
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,469
Ayu: it.

672
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:01,550
Bekah: I guess you've given a lot
of advice throughout this podcast

673
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,340
and through all the blogs that
you've written. So I have, I

674
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,639
guess, two more questions for
you. And the first would be what

675
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:12,769
has been your favorite blog post
to write if you have one and then

676
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:17,150
the second question would be, if
you had advice to give to

677
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,690
somebody in your shoes, what
would that advice.

678
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:29,760
Ayu: My favorite. My favorite
post so far is the last one to be

679
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,130
honest system, massive burnout
ones that when I, uh, that's the

680
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:41,309
fastest one that I, that I wrote
because it's really coming,

681
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,150
coming from, like, I don't, I
don't really filter it. It's just

682
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:49,409
coming out and yeah, that will
one is my favorite blog posts.

683
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,574
And if I have. Uh, oh, what, what
did you say again?

684
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,099
Bekah: If you had one piece of
advice to give to someone in your

685
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,449
shoes, what would it be?

686
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:09,570
Ayu: well, if you, if you're a,
self-learner like try to. Find a

687
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,860
community because it's, it
really, really helps you. I mean,

688
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:20,010
like it's, uh, it helps me a lot.
Uh, I get more confident and, and

689
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:25,980
I have people to support me. And
when, when I can, I also, I also

690
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,809
can support someone. Right. And
it makes you feel like you're not

691
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,239
alone, but also fell you bowl or
somebody else. And if you want to

692
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,005
start your own. Don't think
twice, just, just write it and

693
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:45,644
don't think that maybe nobody
will really read it or maybe it's

694
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:50,594
not good. No, it is just write
it. I mean like it's, uh, you

695
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,554
write it for yourself. That's,
that's the first thing that you

696
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:58,034
only have to think, like write it
for yourself and then the rest

697
00:48:58,155 --> 00:48:58,844
will come.

698
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,840
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great.
