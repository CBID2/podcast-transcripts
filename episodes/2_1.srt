00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,789
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome back to the Virtual

2
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,039
Coffee podcast. I'm Bekah, and
this is a podcast that features

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,789
members of the Virtual Coffee
community. Virtual Coffee is an

4
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,820
intimate group of developers at
all stages of their coding

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,579
journey. And they're here on
this podcast sharing their

6
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,640
stories and what they've
learned. Here with me today is

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,869
my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,969
Dan Ott: Hey, Bekah, I am pretty
excited to be here for season

9
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,070
two; last season was really
great. We had how many episodes

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,340
we have eight 9...10, nine, nine
amazing episodes. And I know we

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,170
had some really great guests; I
thought we had a good rhythm.

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,219
And I'm pretty I'm pretty pumped
to be back for season two. We

13
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,789
have a very good lineup again,
for this next season.

14
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,269
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And not
only is it Season Two of the

15
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,780
podcast, but also we're also
moving into the second year of

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,670
Virtual Coffee, which is pretty
sweet as well. Pretty cool. What

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,049
started as one tweet as suddenly
turned into a community of

18
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,969
developers and we have had two
sessions of lightning talks,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,700
over 100 Virtual Coffees,
Hacktoberfest, brown bags,

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,599
bookclubs, this podcast, and a
lot more. So it's been pretty

21
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:35,870
great.

22
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,379
Dan Ott: newsletter

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,430
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: and a
newsletter.

24
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,359
Dan Ott: If you would like to
join the Virtual Coffee if

25
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,359
you're not a member already, the
way to join is to come to one of

26
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,120
our coffee events with so we
have coffees right now. We have

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,150
coffees, Tuesday mornings at
9am. Eastern and Thursday

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,920
afternoons at noon, Eastern. So
coming to one of our coffee

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,069
zooms is the way to join the
group. You can get links to

30
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:08,110
those if you go to our website,
Virtualcoffee.io. And I think go

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,590
to the events section something
like that, and come and come and

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:11,949
hang out.

33
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: In this
season. We're talking about some

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,099
new topics and we'll be talking
about starting your journey,

35
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,879
making hard decisions, asking
for help and finding your voice,

36
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,360
so we're really excited to be
sharing these episodes with you.

37
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,870
Dan Ott: Kicking off season two
our first episode we have Gant

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,800
Laborde. Gant Laborde is an
owner of Infinite Red. He's a

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,590
mentor and adjunct professor, a
published author and

40
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,069
award-winning speaker. For 20
years he has been involved in

41
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,860
software development and
continues strong today. He is

42
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,370
recognized as a Google Developer
expert in web and machine

43
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,409
learning. But informally, he is
an open sorcerer, and aspires to

44
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,979
one day become a mad scientist.
I feel like he's I feel like

45
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,330
Gant's already there. Yeah, this
is from Gant's bio that he gave

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,569
us, but I feel like he doesn't
need to aspire anymore. I guess

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,069
for sure he's our local mad
scientist. He blogs, videos, and

48
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,460
maintains popular repositories
for the community. He also just

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,840
released his new book, Learning
Tensorflow.js: Powerful machine

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,110
learning in JavaScript. It's an
O'Reilly book. It's available

51
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,169
now. You can follow more of
Dan's adventures at

52
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:23,500
GantLaborde.com. And this
episode we're going to talk to

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,219
you about overcoming challenges,
being authentic, and finding

54
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,849
your voice.

55
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,330
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,539
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. So we'll introduce

57
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,469
ourselves with our name, where
we're from what we do and a

58
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,430
random checking question. So
today's random checking question

59
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,439
is: the zombie apocalypse is
coming. Who are three people you

60
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,439
want on your team? We hope you
enjoyed this episode.

61
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,030
Hey, I'm BeKah, I am from a
small town in Ohio. I am a front

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,909
end developer. And if I could
bring three people with me in

63
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,189
the zombie apocalypse, I would
bring Marion Ravenwood from

64
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:21,009
Indiana Jones; I would bring the
dog from The Sandlot even though

65
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,100
that's not a person--oh maybe I
should bring Benny "the Jet"

66
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,410
Rodriguez who would be good. And
my six year old has decided to

67
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,579
be called Fireblade now and that
just sounds like it could be

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,529
cool for the zombie apocalypse.
I'll bring him.

69
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,139
Dan Ott: Hi, I'm Dan, a front
end developer from Lakewood,

70
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,980
Ohio. And if I had to choose
three people, I feel like I, I

71
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,410
really feel like we need to get
some powers going. You know, I

72
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,350
was trying to I was trying to
pick up I was a Dumbledor, but

73
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,139
like he's too much of a risk.
Can't run like he's too slow.

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,079
You know? Maybe maybe like later
on Harry probably, Hermione,

75
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,610
honestly, you know, we need her
magic you know; whoever's faster

76
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,939
of the two of them and then
probably; I don't know Hulk

77
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:22,730
maybe, predictable might might
ruin our defenses. And yeah, I

78
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,370
need I need a dog to I don't
know, I'd have to get him in my

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,069
whole power ranking of dogs too
so it's a whole big thing but

80
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,160
you know some some kind of
friendly companion and well

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,269
that's great, Yeah, that's it.

82
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,740
Gant: Hey, I'm Gant Laborde and
in the great zombie apocalypse,

83
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:49,790
I would I, I guess like I'm
supposed to say here my co hosts

84
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,389
like the people here on this
podcast, but I'm sorry, Y'all

85
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:02,060
dead. It would be my daughter
and my partner. So Alicia and

86
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,170
Mila, my dogs but they don't
count as people. And then I get

87
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,500
one more person who gets to go
with me. So I guess I'd take

88
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:14,089
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
Because if I can't figure it

89
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,990
out, I know he can.

90
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:16,279
Dan Ott: I like it.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,759
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Nice. I
suddenly feel bad about not

92
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,959
taking my family.

93
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,449
Gant: You've got Fireblade so...

94
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:30,860
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I do I've
got Fireblade, someone who's

95
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:39,980
gonna get us to where we need to
be. So welcome to the podcast,

96
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,170
Gant. We're really, really happy
to have you here. And I want to

97
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,410
start off with asking a
question: what is one non coding

98
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,079
thing our listeners might not
know about you?

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,379
Gant: So I always hate these
questions because they make me

100
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:07,639
realize just how boring I really
am. I'll say this. I feel like

101
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,389
public speaking is a cool thing.
But I do public speaking about

102
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,399
coding. I'd say like building
stuff, but most of the stuff I

103
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:24,139
build I code like IoT stuff. So
cool. I'll go with the fact that

104
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,470
I used to be terrible at
gardening. Before the pandemic,

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,629
I killed artificial plants.
That's how bad I was. And now

106
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,850
I've had the sandwich yesterday.
The lettuce was from the plant

107
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:44,959
right here next to my monitor
and the spuds were from the

108
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,500
sprouts. We're from my window
sale. And I'm working on some

109
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,350
jalapenos in the backyard to go
ahead and make my own pepper

110
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,759
jelly to mix in with that
sandwich. So truth be told, you

111
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,769
can teach an old dog new tricks.

112
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,839
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Nice. That
is amazing. I want some pepper

113
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,379
jelly now.

114
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,149
Gant: On a sandwich. It's good.
Actually, I don't know if you've

115
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,779
tried that.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,670
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Oh, for
sure.

117
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,168
Gant: sprouts and lettuce
sandwich. That's good.

118
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,649
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Sounds
delicious. I I'm ready for one

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,680
now. So you let me know and that
pepper jelly is done. Alright,

120
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,340
let's talk a little bit about
your origin story and how you

121
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,830
came to be Gant Laborde...

122
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,469
Gant: That's a little bit boring
as well. So like, everybody's

123
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,278
got these really cool stories
about how, you know oh, you

124
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,979
know, I was an accountant or a
teacher for 17 years and then

125
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:54,629
one day I decided forget this
I'm gonna do some kind of like

126
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:57,928
workshop or something. I'm a
changed my life for my career.

127
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,739
My family hated computers. My
family is like very anti

128
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:11,399
computer anti technology. To not
not on purpose. They're just for

129
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,928
some reason my dad kind of kept
it out of the house. And I had a

130
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:19,349
Nintendo and I wasn't allowed to
hook it up to any TV that was

131
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:22,739
worth anything because it would
cause ghosts as something he

132
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:27,958
heard. Whatever. Ghosts not not
like real ghosts. Back when you

133
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,649
had CRTs you could actually
cause like images to get burned

134
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,719
into the phosphorus. So it would
cause issues. So I loved that

135
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:41,639
thing. And then finally he had
to get a work computer that

136
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,649
shows up. And then I make that
computer say hello Gant. It was

137
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,099
windows 3.1 or do some qbasic
aren't making say hello Gant.

138
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:56,219
And I was like, Okay, this is
what I'm doing with my life. So

139
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,969
I self taught myself how to
program in high school. I went

140
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,578
to college for computer
programming, I graduated. I've

141
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,448
just been in this field for so
long, it wasn't like, there was

142
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:15,418
like this weird, cool hero's arc
to get there. It really was that

143
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,499
once my computer was able to
play games and do these cool

144
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:24,028
things, I said, I'm gonna do
that. And I'm gonna be the

145
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:30,208
person in my family who does
that. I guess they could

146
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,089
sprinkle it in here, I did have
a lot of like computer

147
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,769
programmers anxiety, lack of
support. And a few ways. Like,

148
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,688
you know, I didn't have anybody
to ask, I had the oldest

149
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,948
computer in high school, I
didn't have any money. So I

150
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:49,649
guess I've self made myself into
this profession. That's probably

151
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,849
as interesting as I get.

152
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,590
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Well, I
mean, I think that's great.

153
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,070
Because you can make anything
interesting, you are a

154
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,450
storyteller. And you'll find a
way to make it interesting. And

155
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,100
I think that was great. Like,
kind of going off of that. So

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,940
you are basically a master of
all trades, right? Like you do

157
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,440
all of these things. You speak,
you write, you code, you mentor,

158
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,830
you're like my Yoda figure. So
when I have a problem, you just

159
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,620
ask the right questions, and
then I hopefully come to the

160
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,929
right answers. So what is your
favorite thing to do?

161
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:32,750
Gant: Um, I found that it really
depends on my state of mind, I

162
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,080
need to be creative, though, I
need to let creativity flow

163
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,519
through me. And sometimes that's
writing; writing is very

164
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,870
cathartic. If you, you know,
went through high school and

165
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,679
used to get B's in English, and
you kind of enjoyed it, I feel

166
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,519
like you could be bringing in a
whole value to the whole world

167
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,289
of computers and documentation
and storytelling and the helping

168
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,529
and giving narrative, it really
misses a lot of that, you know,

169
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:06,919
it's so calculated that, that
sort of how I want to say that

170
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,899
algorithmic sort of you should
have known this is cold. And it

171
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,080
could use a lot of kindness and
stories and interest and

172
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,970
examples and fun things to kind
of bring in there, like zombie

173
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,769
apocalypses. I would love to
learn via zombie apocalypses as

174
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,440
a course. Actually, there used
to be this Rails course, rails

175
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,539
for zombies, right? And it did
fantastic. Where's the new

176
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:38,240
version of that? Yeah. So my
thing is bring the creativity

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,230
through you, you know, let like,
write the blog posts write the

178
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,210
story is create a game that
helps educate, create podcasts

179
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,320
like this. And so I find that I
tend to center myself around

180
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:57,620
other creatives who, despite,
you might be fantastic At one

181
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,620
thing or another, or maybe your
video editing skills are just

182
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,769
like off the charts. Maybe you
can make a tic toc that

183
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,570
everybody's like, how did you do
that? Whatever it is, bring it

184
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,700
together and use it to tell a
story.

185
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,389
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
love that. I did--I had totally

186
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,860
forgotten about it, but--I did
crypto zombies a couple of years

187
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,570
ago. And that was really fun. So
it's programming with etherium.

188
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,379
And you were going through and
defeating these zombies, I think.

189
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,909
Dan Ott: Yeah, there was a CSS
Flexbox course, that's all like

190
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,159
zombie. Zombie-like, solve a
bunch of zombie related puzzles

191
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,720
to like learn CSS,

192
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,429
Gant: I guess you got to like,
get down in the alleyway using

193
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:44,490
Flexbox without touching the
zombies or something. That'd be

194
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,000
funny. Yeah.

195
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's
awesome. Now we need a

196
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,549
collection of all of the the
zombie coding lessons that are

197
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,269
out there.

198
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,379
Gant: Yes.

199
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Um, so so
speaking of zombies, and

200
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,049
challenges, what are some of the
challenges that you've gone

201
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,139
through in this journey? I think
you know, you come off as

202
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,529
someone that can do a lot of
things really, really well. But

203
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,779
I know that we all go through
something. And so I especially

204
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,519
love to hear from people who do
things so effortlessly, you

205
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,370
know, what they had to do to get
to that point.

206
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,379
Gant: There's a couple there's a
Choose Your Own Adventure:

207
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,990
there's trying to graduate was
really hard for me because I was

208
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,440
a I was a D student in math. I
wasn't very good at math. I

209
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,470
didn't see how it actually
pertained with anything. And

210
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,320
that was really hard for a
while. NowI actually watch math

211
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,250
YouTube videos for fun. So
that's a different version of

212
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,950
me. The other thing I'll say is
that I used to be afraid of

213
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,730
crowds or speaking at all, at
all. I had a college, you know,

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,789
101 psychology, no no it was
philosophy. And I did everything

215
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,070
wrong, like I'm getting ready to
go ahead and do this right? I

216
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,899
have no money. I'm in college
first year, I decided, you know

217
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,750
what I'm gonna do that I'm
really nervous about this, I'm

218
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,759
gonna treat myself to a really
nice latte. I'll feel very happy

219
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,970
because I've got this latte. I'm
just going to put myself in the

220
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,389
corner up until it's time for me
to go ahead and give my talk.

221
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,929
And so I drink my latte, sat in
the corner, just kind of like

222
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,100
crowded over myself, sitting
over my notes, reading, reading,

223
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,250
reading, and you know, like the
first sentence, almost like, I

224
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,100
couldn't help myself, I was just
consistently rereading the whole

225
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,870
thing. Get up there. Just super
ready to go ahead and give this

226
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,620
presentation. First sentence
comes out of my mouth. Boom.

227
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,440
There you go. Take that
everybody. What's the second

228
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,500
sentence? Gant what's the second
sentence? Gant? Did you memorize

229
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,049
the second sentence? Alright,
now it's quiet. Forget the

230
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:03,960
second sentence, you're
completely quiet and everybody's

231
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,500
looking at you. Come up with
something that's better than the

232
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,549
second sentence. Right now, with
everybody watching, do something

233
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,659
that's gonna be fantastic and
blow everybody away. It is.

234
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:19,500
Okay, you're still quiet. And
everybody's still looking at

235
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,559
you. You just need to say the
second sentence. That's really

236
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,620
good. Now, no pressure better be
the best second sentence you've

237
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,039
ever said in your life.
Someone's coming over to you.

238
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,720
They're moving you to the side
of the room. They're continuing

239
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,700
this talk without you. You still
haven't said anything. That's

240
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,850
what happened to me in college.
And that's where I was. And

241
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,840
everything I did to prepare for
that was wrong. Everything I did

242
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,840
was wrong. And from that day, to
where I am now, that that's a

243
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,100
that's another adventure. So
yeah, I could talk about either

244
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,980
of those things. Your choice?

245
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,549
Dan Ott: Well, just listening to
you describe that. I'm like

246
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,259
sweating now just listening.
Like,

247
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,700
Gant: --you know what, you know,
you're you're not hyper tuned

248
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,150
into one person, the audience,
you are reading the minds of

249
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,140
about 30 people watching you.
You're like, I think I saw

250
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:24,579
somebody roll their eyes, you
know, in the third row. Like, I

251
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,420
was super tuned in to all the
wrong things. So so named some

252
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,819
of the things I did wrong there.
One I took I had coffee, right

253
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,859
before I was gonna give a talk
was I was nervous about what I

254
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,809
was crowded over myself. I had a
body language. I know that

255
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,779
there's a lot of argument about
power posing being false or

256
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:52,390
whatever. No, I think I think
that even if it's not

257
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,849
specifically tied to
testosterone, or if they can't

258
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,890
have, they're having trouble
proving that part of it, I don't

259
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,880
care how you're positioning
yourself right before a talk

260
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:06,369
helps create, you know how
you're going to be doing it. I I

261
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:09,970
was trying to memorize, I was
rereading the same thing. I

262
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,099
tried to come up with something
right on the spot. Instead of

263
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,069
understanding how to go ahead
and present a story. I was

264
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:22,599
presenting exactly what I was
trying to say. It was I was

265
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,890
trying to be perfect. And so all
those things were totally wrong.

266
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,819
And it created a super fear
existing human being putting me

267
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:37,599
in a crowd any more than like a
small circle of people, and I

268
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,539
would start getting extremely
uncomfortable. Now, I've I've

269
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,099
MCed conferences, online and in
person with over 1000s of

270
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:53,380
people, so it's a big change.
But that was a bunch of steps

271
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,509
between here and there. I do
have a blog post about that,

272
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,980
too. I can share that at some
point.

273
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:00,309
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. Well,
shall we need to drop that in

274
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,720
the show? Yeah.

275
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,309
Dan Ott: I mean, that yeah,
that's very like this, that

276
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,329
whole... That door is the one I
choose. Sorry. Yeah, picking the

277
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,809
door. But like, what were some
like, I mean, obviously, it's a

278
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,660
lot of time has passed since
then. You know, and there's no

279
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,849
you know, just like go like that
to from from stage fright to

280
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,539
where you are now. But can you
like highlight some? I don't

281
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,029
know. Some "aha" moments are
like what, I don't know if it

282
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:31,299
was just, you know, reading
books and dressing or how did

283
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,240
you get closer to being more
comfortable? You know,

284
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:38,019
Gant: It's a combo move. For
sure. One of the things I

285
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,309
realized was I did everything
wrong, right. I was anxious, not

286
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,869
excited. So like, which actually
changes your biochemical makeup.

287
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,950
So first thing I did was kind of
like studied, what the hell did

288
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,519
my body just do? Why did I go
into fight or flight? and why

289
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,720
would my body go into fight or
flight talking to people? Why

290
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,009
whatever evolutionary thing is
that that's gonna be so good for

291
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,880
me. And the truth is like, it's,
it's great for as a societal

292
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,789
animal not to have everybody
ready to go ahead and take the

293
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,529
stage and talk, you know, we
inherently actually respect the

294
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,829
stage and the power of it and
the passing of the microphone,

295
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:22,960
there's a reason why MCs will
sort of like, almost like, pass

296
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,680
the baton and shake someone's
hand, as, as an authority pass

297
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,319
to the next person who's coming
up and talking, there's a

298
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,339
certain programming that we all
follow, or looking at these

299
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:40,779
things. And, you know, when I
was kind of like, analyzing

300
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,829
this, I could see how wrong I
was, I could see all this stuff.

301
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,440
But like, when I was anxious, my
body was releasing all this

302
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,920
cortisol in my blood system, and
it was just more and more

303
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,890
cortisol is causing me to get
more and more fight or flight.

304
00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:00,160
Neither of those will let you
give a talk. I can't go in the

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,890
front row and punch the first
person I see. And I can't run

306
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,309
out of the room. So I froze.
Yeah, I didn't have I couldn't

307
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,089
do either the fight or the
flight. And so what I was

308
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:13,750
missing was oxytocin, you know,
which is actually what you have,

309
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,990
as the difference between a
person who's about to go on a

310
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,130
ride, and be excited about going
on a ride, you're standing in

311
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,700
line, you're kind of jumping up
and down, you're like, yeah, and

312
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,119
so you don't have anxiety.
Because cortisol is dripping

313
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,579
through your bloodstream,
telling you pay attention, as

314
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:33,309
pay attention, that be afraid
that's be afraid of that. And

315
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,410
without oxytocin combined with
that, your blood vessels all

316
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,759
shrink up. And it just creates
this hyper tunnel vision of

317
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,410
what's going on. And that
oxytocin helps relax you and

318
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,529
also make sure you're paying
attention to the right things.

319
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,750
And so I wasn't leaning into
that I wasn't leaning into all

320
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,170
these things. And when I found
out sort of what the biochemical

321
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,309
and what my body was doing, I
found out like, Hey, now with

322
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:09,039
practice, you can figure out how
to get your oxytocin released,

323
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,569
prepare for a talk, get these
things happening. And, and then

324
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:18,009
I went to my local Toastmasters.
And I was nervous as hell. And

325
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:22,210
what they did is, let me talk as
much as I was comfortable

326
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,109
talking. It was just like me
saying my name and sitting back

327
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,950
down. That's all I had to do.
But I could always like do a

328
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,980
little bit more to a little bit
more to a little bit more. And

329
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,890
then so that let me sort of like
carve through the stone a little

330
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,450
bit. And I want to say, just,
you know, half a year of

331
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,970
Toastmasters is probably the
most valuable thing I can

332
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,019
recommend to anybody.

333
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,660
Dan Ott: Can you can you share
what like what Toastmasters is

334
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,559
just general?

335
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,160
Gant: Yeah, absolutely.
Toastmasters was formed at the

336
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,660
YMCA back in like 19-- whatever.

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,740
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
it's 98 years old?

338
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,420
Gant: Yeah, it's this
ridiculously old organization is

339
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,380
a fantastic organization where
it was just the only way that

340
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,640
you can, you can learn a lot
about public speaking. But then

341
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,599
you got to do it. It's like, you
can learn how, you know, a gun

342
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,599
works. But people still have to
go to the gun range, you can

343
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,920
learn a lot about swimming, but
you still have to go swim. You

344
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,299
have to go do the thing. And so
how do you do public speaking,

345
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:28,450
you know, like, you're gonna sit
in the in front of a mirror and

346
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,509
practice it and that you need,
you need a bunch of people who

347
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:34,960
agree that they'll listen to
you, and you'll listen to them

348
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,380
and you'll give each other
feedback in a safe space. And

349
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,119
that's what Toastmasters really
is, it has three pillars, one of

350
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,799
sort of this public speaking,
another one of this evaluation,

351
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,279
and then this third part that
ties them together, which is

352
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,970
like this Leadership Initiative.
So if you want to get better at

353
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:02,109
giving people feedback, speaking
or leading, that's the place and

354
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:06,039
so it's cheap as hell man these
people haven't raised their

355
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,630
prices since forever It's
international so people who are

356
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,380
listening to this like there's a
there's a Toastmasters quite a

357
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,430
few in Amsterdam, you know, all
kinds these other places. So and

358
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,960
they have like, the speaking
competitions and fun stuff to go

359
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,730
watch and cool people to go see
and, and motivational stuff. So

360
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,640
if you get yourself mixed up in
there for a little bit, and you

361
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,869
kind of learn what your body was
doing. The inevitable conclusion

362
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,880
is that you will sort of solve
your, your your own sort of

363
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,900
quandary that you can't solve,
you know, just by being the

364
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,349
first time you speaking in front
of a class for a great, you

365
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:52,839
know, like, what a terrible
first experience. And way better

366
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,859
than that is a group of friendly
people who have worked with 100

367
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:00,910
people just like you, who had
the same concern. Have you had

368
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,869
and give you the amount of
feedback that you're ready to

369
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:09,369
receive? Because I've learned
some pretty advanced tricks. But

370
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,390
I didn't learn those my first
year at Toastmasters? Hell no, I

371
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,390
was just learning how to go
ahead and get up there without

372
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,089
having a down a whole bottle of
wine at a time or something.

373
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,180
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: They do
have oxytocin nose spray, so

374
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,200
maybe that's the,

375
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,049
Gant: well see, there you go.
Well, even even easier than that

376
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,839
is like if you. So I'll say
this, like when you're about to

377
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,990
lift weights, you can. You can
do all kinds of crazy stuff. But

378
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,599
you can actually like, get
yourself in the right mindset,

379
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,569
to lift weights. If you're about
to go for a run, you can get

380
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:44,750
yourself in the right mindset to
go for a run. And if you're

381
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,730
about to give a talk, you can
get yourself in the right

382
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,599
mindset to give a talk. It's
just the same thing as all those

383
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:57,200
other things. So I would always
go for the internal skill versus

384
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,309
running out of nose spray at the
right time, or whatever else

385
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,730
happens. But yeah, it is it is
good that we're kind of like

386
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,420
chemically biohacking ourselves.
But I think that starts with

387
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,309
what we eat, think and do.

388
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that's such great advice. And

389
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,380
that goes across so many
different boards, you know,

390
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,509
whether you're coding or, you
know, we talked about

391
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,599
interviewing a lot of Virtual
Coffee, and you go into an

392
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,190
interview, I always like to,
like, watch a comedy show or

393
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,900
Yes, funny clips beforehand,
because I do that, you know, get

394
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,500
that fight or flight. And it's
so intense that unless I can

395
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,450
bring that down. It's really
hard for me to get back to a

396
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,319
place where I can answer
something confidently or present

397
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,589
in a positive way.

398
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,279
Gant: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. The
fight or flight is, is it is

399
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,609
awkward for us as an evolved
societal species. You know, it's

400
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:01,579
fantastic. If somebody breaks
into your house, but almost day

401
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:05,990
to day, it's such a great skill
for you to kind of manage that,

402
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,190
that discomfort and be able to
work on it a bit. So I'd say

403
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,390
like, it's kind of a life skill.
It's opened up a lot of I'll say

404
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,660
Toastmasters has opened up a lot
of doors for me, and I can never

405
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,029
stop singing their praises for
for honestly, what they've done.

406
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:22,880
I can have a hard conversation
with someone. You know, there

407
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,549
was something I couldn't do
either. I could do it anytime I

408
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:26,210
need to know.

409
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,940
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I could
do--can I call you? Instead of

410
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,640
me doing it? I'll just let you
do the hard conversation.

411
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,819
Gant: You're fired! You're done!
I just just record me, you're

412
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,299
fired?

413
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,920
Dan Ott: Can you use the zombie?
The like one of the zombie tones

414
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,210
for that too? Like?

415
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,500
Gant: Yeah, I have to pull up
all the weird stuff.

416
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:48,230
Dan Ott: Voice modifier for
you're fired?

417
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,799
Gant: Probably have to...fired?
I guess. Let me let me go ahead

418
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,220
and find one for you. And I'll
come back to that. It changed

419
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,400
their icons on me for the voice
month stuff. And now I don't

420
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,450
know what anything does.

421
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,750
Dan Ott: Yeah, I don't feel like
I just

422
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:24,390
That's it. That's it. We found
it. That's interesting. It's

423
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,559
really interesting. how all this
stuff kind of relates, though,

424
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:32,759
and the, yeah, the fight or
flight and the way that your

425
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,549
body is, like, the reasons
behind why your body's doing

426
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:39,900
things, you know, or your mind
is reacting to things. I feel

427
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,720
like that aspect of it is really
important to learn and not just

428
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,420
for obviously, for public
speaking, I've been doing a lot

429
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,829
of that with, like with any
anxiety stuff, too. And yes, and

430
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:54,119
it's all sort of part of the
same puzzle, you know, and,

431
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,960
yeah, I think that's very
interesting that it's like that

432
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,039
was one of your like, starting,
you know, like one for all this

433
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:02,819
is cool.

434
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:07,378
Gant: Hey, it's about so we have
a saying, I'm gonna I'm gonna

435
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,229
Toastmaster y'all real quick
with a saying we don't, we don't

436
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,798
get rid of the butterflies in
your stomach. You make them fly

437
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,699
in formation. And it's about
writing your energy levels. Like

438
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:21,868
for instance, I am naturally a
little bit anxious with that is

439
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:26,159
what I realized, which makes me
excited when I go places. So I

440
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,769
am about to give a talk before
I'm on there. I feel like I'm

441
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:32,429
about to get on a cool ride. And
then when I get off of it, I

442
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,088
feel like I was on a cool ride.
If you're normally a board

443
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:39,659
person, you can be a relaxed
person. You know, if you're

444
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,949
stubborn, then you could be
committed. It's not about

445
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:48,898
changing who you are. It's about
changing the outcome and what

446
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:51,749
that ride is. And you could
apply this to all these

447
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,469
different things like he, I'm
not going to change my

448
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,459
biochemical makeup much more
than a little bit. But that's

449
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:03,298
enough. You know, you can
significantly alter the outcome

450
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:07,979
with some well placed chess
pieces along your way. And make

451
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:12,989
yourself you know, let's say
like you say you get on stage,

452
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:16,888
and you're just way too hyper.
Well, I mean, if if you present

453
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19,828
that as energetic, I mean,
that's fantastic. I mean, that's

454
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:22,888
what you want, when someone's
running your spin class, you

455
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:28,108
know, like, people are paying a
ton for the most energetic spin

456
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:32,788
class, you know, like videos
that are out there. And people

457
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:36,749
find that niche, and they kind
of ride it. That's, that's how

458
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:38,189
you turn it into success.

459
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:41,159
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I find for
me, it's much easier to do in

460
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,538
front of a live audience. So you
know, being virtual, and giving

461
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:48,538
talks that way, it's been much
harder because I can burn that

462
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,229
nervous energy in front of a
crowd of people. But when I'm

463
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:56,519
looking at myself on the screen,
giving a talk, there's nowhere

464
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,239
to put it.

465
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,500
Gant: Yeah, and there's a
there's another piece of this,

466
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,589
I'll say that when I was. So
here's something I noticed, I

467
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:10,289
was able, fortunately enough
before the pandemic to give

468
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,950
enough talks, to believe that
audience is on my side and wants

469
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,420
me to succeed. They are super
awesome. One time we had a

470
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,529
technical glitch, and I jumped
on stage to go ahead and say the

471
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,859
technical glitch, because the
audience would, I knew they

472
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,529
would support me, I knew they
were they wanted someone to come

473
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:31,529
out there and make a joke about
the technical glitch. Right?

474
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,579
That's great. But now anybody
getting into speaking in a

475
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,839
virtual world has no
reinforcement on what their

476
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,200
audience really wants, and what
they're really feeling. And they

477
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,319
don't see heads nodding in the
front row, or whatever it is,

478
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,559
and they're not looking for the
positivity is hard to find. So I

479
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,559
couldn't imagine what it's like
to start breaking into that

480
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,380
during the pandemic, and start
actually having this where you

481
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,380
don't get any kind of
reinforcement as a speaker. And

482
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,730
the second thing that's really
awkward about that is, I think

483
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:09,420
audiences really need to step
up, send, if someone does a

484
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,140
tweet that you like, don't just
heart it, say, I love this

485
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,559
tweet. Thank you so much. If
someone does a podcast you like,

486
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:18,240
you need to go find them
afterwards, you can say

487
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,690
something. It's so much more
important as virtual world.

488
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,269
Because it's just like, I know
somebody who did a blog post,

489
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,940
and they're like, nobody cared
about this blog post, as like,

490
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,299
well, what's the stats on it?
And there's 1000s of people who

491
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,869
had read the blog post, I was
like, Here's 1000s of people's

492
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,720
whose life you've influenced and
like, well, how come no one left

493
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,470
a comment. I was like, Well,
welcome to the virtual world of

494
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:49,200
lurking where you're gonna get
one comment per 10,000 people

495
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,519
who care. That's it. And that's
a little bit weird. We're not

496
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,099
programmed for that, either. So
this is the next battle.

497
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,940
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, that
is so hard to try and work

498
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,960
through that. And you're,
especially when you're writing a

499
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,259
blog post or a tweet, like you
said, or, you know, you you're

500
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,579
releasing your second book here
soon. And so you put all of this

501
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:19,019
time and effort and heart into
creating these things. And then

502
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:25,049
when there's no feedback, it can
be challenging and kind of doubt

503
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:29,069
or imposter syndrome or
whatever, because you have sunk

504
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,569
a lot of yourself into it.

505
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,929
Gant: Yeah, it's put yourself
out into the void and it feels

506
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,378
like nothing nothing heard you
nothing said that. You know,

507
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:47,249
that's, I feel very Okay, I know
that some of us in this podcast

508
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:50,398
has gotten some kind of value
out of it. And that makes me

509
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,169
extremely happy. I know that by
the way, you know, y'all get a

510
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:00,689
lot more likes on your tweets
and I I got to work on my

511
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:03,358
tweeting structure to have it
more conversational because I

512
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:07,318
just tend to tell people stuff
it's to like Redux you know,

513
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:11,818
it's just like uni directional
process here. I need to work on

514
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:16,708
that a bit. But I think being
here is perfect

515
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,420
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: my most
liked tweets are about my kids

516
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,139
and poop. So good. Start there.

517
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,750
Gant: Okay, you got it. I will...

518
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:30,070
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: see how
that goes

519
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:35,440
Dan Ott: Every parent has just
millions of poop stories i feel

520
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,710
like

521
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,760
Gant: I i have i've been
tempting fate as well. I just

522
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,050
hung an oil painting in my
living room. And if you see a

523
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,329
photo of my living room, it is
for my daughter. She has a slide

524
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,429
and this and that and and these
cushions that I apparently had

525
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,329
to buy because they're super
they're basically like mad. This

526
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,960
is like memory foam mattresses a
fold out. But they named it for

527
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,739
kids. So now it's more expensive
and I had to get those. And I've

528
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,289
got all this stuff all over the
place. They just see this oil

529
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:17,280
painting. I'm like, I'm gonna
defend it. I mean, it's not

530
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,650
gonna last I know it's gonna get
destroyed. I'm trying.

531
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:25,150
Dan Ott: Yeah, we had, you know,
an old TV in our family room

532
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,539
with same deal slide all the all
the all that, that we move the

533
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,849
couches all over the place and
stuff. And I was always joking

534
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,500
about like, if you're gonna
throw things at the wall, just

535
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,380
aim it at this TV so that we can
get a new one you know, but then

536
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:44,349
we got a new one. And now I'm
like, Okay, do not. Do not. So

537
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,400
far so far. Everything's fine.

538
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:53,500
Gant: That's good.
Oh, man. All right, kids and

539
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,019
poop, done. I'm right there
right here. It's on my desk

540
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,360
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: in your
Gant, Gant way of writing things

541
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:03,369
you have to find. Find the right
way to do it, I guess.

542
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:04,530
Gant: Perfect.

543
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,389
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So what
like kind of going back to what

544
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:13,230
we were talking about before you
have a really distinct voice and

545
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,449
all of the stuff that you do.
And it's nice, because it's

546
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:19,650
really consistent. Like, if I
opened up an article, I don't

547
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,190
need to read that. It's by Gant
Laborde because I read it. I'm

548
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,909
like, this is definitely an
again, article, right? And so

549
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,000
you're like covering it and all
these spaces? So like, how have

550
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,739
you managed to stay like
consistent across all of these

551
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:35,369
things?

552
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,210
Gant: Here's something funny, I
wrote a blog post really late at

553
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,110
night. And I asked a few friends
to review it. And they're both

554
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,670
their feedback was this isn't
Gant enough? You've you failed

555
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,059
as like, I don't want to rewrite
it. So like, I went back in

556
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,239
there, I was like, Oh, I see
what they're saying. Then I kind

557
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,860
of re added stuff to it as like,
Here you go, can you review

558
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,489
this? And they're like, yeah,
there you are. Which is really

559
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:08,639
funny. I'd say that. For me.
It's my it's, it's a little bit

560
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,809
of authenticity of myself here.
And I don't, I don't think that

561
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,809
I'm a great story. Sometimes I
every I think that might be

562
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:21,059
everybody's case, right? We, I
know my story. I've been

563
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,110
watching it for 40 years. So
unfortunately, I am a little bit

564
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,400
like, I'll be able to do my
voice anytime. And I'll be able

565
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,090
to do my version of something
anytime. I don't know if it

566
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,369
always is going to resonate with
people or if it's going to be

567
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:39,809
that. But for the most part, I
need to I need to get over that.

568
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:45,929
And I need to do it more. So I'd
say that if you were turning

569
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,960
yourself into a brand, or you
know, if you're working on your

570
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,630
own brand, be as authentic as
you can. And I think that's

571
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,480
what's so great about the fact
that your kids and poop stories

572
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,250
are doing so well on Twitter.
Because if you were trying to do

573
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,000
something else, I think
everybody would notice, you

574
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,570
know, like that goes away. And
you got to find what you're

575
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,949
really, really, really excited
about and, and what, bring that

576
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:18,179
to the forefront. And then you
will always speak in your voice.

577
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:23,070
So when I am talking to people,
I'm very excited about the

578
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,250
people I'm talking to. And I
really want to get my story

579
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,250
across. And I want to make it
like fun and entertaining. And

580
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,559
this is the same thing. If we
saw each other at a conference,

581
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,550
and we had to talk about what
your top three movies right,

582
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,730
then I'm going to talk about
that the same exact way because

583
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,570
that's who I am. And if we go
out to dinner and have drinks,

584
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,239
and everybody's like, Come,
actually anybody come visit New

585
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,050
Orleans, once the world opens
up. Let's do that, like, let's

586
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,650
go all have drinks and sit out
there and listen to some jazz,

587
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,190
and talk about whatever it is,
but I'm going to sound exactly

588
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,150
the same. And that gives me the
easiest way to keep my voice

589
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,849
consistent. Now I can raise that
bar by by improving who I am. So

590
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,750
this is like that same thing I
was talking about before, where

591
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:13,559
you've you've not destroying
your energy, but you're

592
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,989
channeling it and you're kind of
improving it and you're working

593
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:20,010
on it, you're letting it flow in
a different different way. So if

594
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,840
I, you know, go start taking
music lessons, or if I start

595
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,780
learning how to speak with this
crazy new dialect or I start

596
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,260
doing Shakespeare in my spare
time. Those things are going to

597
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,039
pepper into who I am, and what's
going to start happening there.

598
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,380
And then the bar raises in
everything that I do. So I found

599
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,389
that like Virtual Coffee is a
lot about virtual improvement as

600
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:52,320
well like improving yourself.
You have book clubs you have

601
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,179
finding your voice here. You
have mentorship and things like

602
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:01,650
that. Those are all perfect. As
long as they're actually coming

603
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,400
in and hitting home and being
who they are, I know people who

604
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,309
tried to open up like Twitter
accounts to be a personality.

605
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,000
They did great for three months,
and then just couldn't keep it

606
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,059
going. This is the formula for
consistency. Be 100%. You.

607
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,050
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
really great advice. I like

608
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,909
that. And I think for me, so
normally when I'm writing, it's

609
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:30,420
just more, it's personal. It's
storytelling. And that's where I

610
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,170
feel comfortable. And so I've
tried to write more technical

611
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,989
things, and it's much harder,
because it's like this

612
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:41,039
negotiation of like, why I need
to appear to be an authority or

613
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,150
something like I'm not an
authority on this. Like finding,

614
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:48,300
figuring out how to find that
balance of like, okay, just

615
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:56,099
like, be myself, but also be
myself and talk about code, you

616
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:56,429
kn ow?

617
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:03,679
Gant: Yeah. Well, and and the
thority. Here's a weird thing,

618
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,739
the authority doesn't have to
say they're an authority, or

619
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,099
doesn't have to talk like an
authority to be an authority for

620
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:14,210
a certain time, especially in
our field. So we're used to

621
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:19,400
authority coming from, like a
uniform particular mentality and

622
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,059
things like that. But, but
that's just the first, you know,

623
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,570
reaction that we have. And then
after that, and authority

624
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,559
doesn't have to say they're in
authority. That's a sing. That's

625
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,489
a sign of it. And so my last
blog post for the Google

626
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:39,679
Developer experts that was
published, has a Harry Potter

627
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,420
themed cartoons and terrible
drawings in it, and a secret

628
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:48,590
easter egg, that if you draw a
skull on the website, it'll,

629
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,920
it'll like, show these snakes
that come out and call you a

630
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,369
death either. It's like a fun
little thing. And what happens

631
00:41:55,369 --> 00:42:00,679
is, none of that is
professional. But I think that

632
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,960
what's great about it is that,
sure, we set up a little bit of

633
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,980
the professionalism and why this
is on that blog post and what

634
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,349
the categories are, and what the
technology that's going to be

635
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:17,210
used are. And then the trick is
not to sit there and constantly

636
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,010
say, I am still an authority,
let your let your story be told,

637
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,769
and let people be able to leave
that because they're already

638
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:28,070
following you. Now you have the
stage, you don't have to keep

639
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,260
mentioning, you're on stage and
you're talking into a

640
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,659
microphone, you have the
attention. Now keep it, that's

641
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:40,309
the trick. If you were to bring
out the most boring person on

642
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,130
stage, I could give them an
introduction and hand them a

643
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,159
microphone and everybody would
start listening. And that would

644
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,420
be my job as an emcee or as the
person who brought them on. But

645
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,659
Five minutes later, if they're
not listening, that's not my

646
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:56,960
fault. That's the story that
they're telling. That's what's

647
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,510
going on. So you can start with
authority, but don't stay in it.

648
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,739
It's not, it's not really as
cool as it sounds. And I would

649
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:12,829
say, that's...there's, there's
enough people ready to hand you

650
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:15,679
a microphone that you don't have
to worry about improving your

651
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,469
authority, you just have to be
willing to go ahead and accept

652
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:20,119
poor microphones in your life.

653
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,389
Dan Ott: I Like that, yeah, one
thing that I have worked on with

654
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,150
this sort of thing, too, is, is
if you're writing about a topic,

655
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,860
you know, you don't have to,
it's okay that you don't know

656
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,289
everything you know, and also,
like your readers, or audience,

657
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:39,320
or whatever, will maybe trust
you more, if you are upfront

658
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,719
about like, I'm not really sure
about this part, but here's what

659
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,380
how I solved it or, you know,
that kind of thing. I found

660
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,690
personally, like, it's a
struggle to get through

661
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,230
sometimes because you want it
like you. I don't know, like, my

662
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,179
lizard brain wants people to,
you know, think that I know

663
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:57,050
everything or whatever, you
know. So like working on that,

664
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,610
like little step of I really
don't know everything, here's

665
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,769
how I solve this problem,
whatever, you know, and like,

666
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,789
like, I feel like, when I'm
reading as an audience member,

667
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:11,269
listening or reading that, that
sort of thing actually makes it

668
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,800
helps me trust somebody, you
know, more, more than if they

669
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,679
don't mention it or act like,
you know, in some way that they,

670
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,230
you know, pretend to they know
everything because nobody does,

671
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,679
Gant: no one actually wants
perfection man, it really

672
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:27,989
you know, so
doesn't, you know, the PhD

673
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,440
presentations, like you're
talking about where nobody can

674
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:34,409
be wrong. You can't go up on the
curb. You can't you know, you

675
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:39,360
have to have driven most
effectively. I mean, how many

676
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:43,920
how many PhD presentations? Can
you go to a conference and

677
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:47,400
watch? Like, it's just, it's
terrible. If you ask and then we

678
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:55,199
could do this experiment right
now. Think right now about the

679
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:58,170
best talk that you've ever seen
in person, the one that was

680
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,710
like, Wow, that was really
really good. Just choose one of

681
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:06,900
the Really good ones. I want you
to name three properties of that

682
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:11,820
talk. Okay, so like three
adjectives that describe that

683
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,599
talk. And we'll start to you,
Bekah.

684
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:18,929
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Um it,
okay. It was engaging and no,

685
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:19,949
that's not an adjective.

686
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,710
Gant: Not perfect, perfect.
Yeah, engaging.

687
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,630
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Something
the entire audience could relate

688
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,409
to at different stages. So I
guess relatability maybe? Yeah.

689
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,519
Um, and then was fun.

690
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,119
Gant: Yeah. Perfect. And we'll
get three more.

691
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,090
Dan Ott: Yeah. So as I was also
struggling with a word choice,

692
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,670
but it was like, non pol...,
like, not all the way polished.

693
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,469
I don't know, what's the right
word for that? Yeah.

694
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,420
Gant: And that's that, you

695
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,480
Dan Ott: know, like, the story
was personal. I mean, it was a

696
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,650
tech talk ostensibly, but the
story behind it was, like,

697
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,139
personal so like, you know,
relatable, like kind of like

698
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,719
Bekah saying and had a third
thing, but I forget exactly what

699
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,380
it was. I don't my mind. My mind
is, is empty now.

700
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:16,050
Gant: That's okay. Neither of
y'all said perfect. No one says

701
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,340
perfect. And that's, that's what
we can get. What was it

702
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,239
relatable? Is someone coming and
feeling like they're making eye

703
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,739
contact with you, and leading
you through something fun, and

704
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:33,750
relatable. That's it.
Congratulations, like, that's

705
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:38,519
it. Nothing you do should be
perfect. No one cares about the

706
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,510
perfect speech that they saw.
That person failed. The

707
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,960
relatable speech is the one that
was everybody's favorite. teta.

708
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:52,349
Now, the bar is a lot easier. I
think we can reach telling a

709
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:55,530
story and having people be happy
that they heard it.

710
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:00,280
Dan Ott: Yeah. I love that way
of thinking about the whole

711
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,639
thing.

712
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,449
Gant: Yeah.

713
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,780
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: When I gave
my first talk at a conference,

714
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,110
it was when I was a graduate
student in English. And it's a

715
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:14,099
very different feel. Because it
is you have to be perfect. And

716
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,340
there will be that person in the
audience who will raise their

717
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,750
hand and try and stump you or to
make you feel like you don't

718
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,679
really know what you're talking
about. Like, trying to unlearn

719
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,219
that anxiety, that first
experience, guys.

720
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:33,440
Gant: I had that. So I did a
keynote for Amazon. It was one

721
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,760
of my favorite talks I ever
gave. It was a it was amazing.

722
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,840
It was great. And we had q&a
afterward. And there were so

723
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,099
many cool q&a. And then there
was that one person, you know,

724
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:50,360
who stands up and says, starts
telling their life story. Like,

725
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,550
like, Okay, you've got the
microphone, and now it's your

726
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,670
turn. Okay, go ahead. They do
all this stuff, then they asked

727
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,619
the most esoteric question. And
it was like this really crazy

728
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,590
thing and this and that. And
they just wanted to sound super

729
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,010
impressive. And I knew everybody
knew I basically I could say

730
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,690
something. And we could have
this conversation be like done,

731
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,900
because like no one else who was
there was following what they

732
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,159
were saying. And I was half
following it. And if I just kind

733
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:22,519
of conceded to them, they would
have been like, haha, you know,

734
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,519
I know so much. And then they
would have maybe sat down or

735
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:31,730
something. The way I handled it
is because I saw it happen as

736
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,219
like, this person is not
supposed to be here. That's not

737
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,340
the you know, this. You're at
the wrong kind of talk. So I

738
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:48,139
told them, I said, Google it.
Google it. They were they were

739
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,809
visually shocked that I said
that. And I actually enjoyed

740
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:54,440
that way more.

741
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:00,590
Dan Ott: It's the "Let me Google
that for you" approach.

742
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:06,750
Gant: Yeah. Yeah, I guess they
didn't expect that to come. You

743
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:11,579
know, there's, there's always
those people and truth is, you

744
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:12,780
don't need to waste time on that.

745
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:19,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah.
totally true. I just need my

746
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:27,719
brain to remember. You know, I
like I really have enjoyed this

747
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:31,199
interview. I think that you just
do such a good job of like

748
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:38,219
mentoring in every situation.
And, you know, Have you always

749
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:41,579
been that way? Like is that a
skill you develop?

750
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,650
Gant: I honestly say I learned a
lot of how so I won Best

751
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,750
evaluator and some Toastmasters
competitions. I learned I

752
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,869
learned how to evaluate and give
constructive feedback there.

753
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,489
Like I said, there's three
pillars to it, and I really do

754
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:06,869
Oh, My speaking ability, my
ability to give feedback and my

755
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:10,230
a lot of my leadership skills, I
really do owe to the fact that

756
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:15,210
I've been area governor at
Toastmasters for a year, I've

757
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,530
been a club mentor, I've spoken
in competitions, as well as a

758
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,519
club level, like hundreds of
times now. And I've been an

759
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,900
evaluator hundreds of times.
It's just these are the things

760
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,719
that that I've been allowed to
practice. And anybody who goes

761
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,619
and practices these things, is
going to find that they've built

762
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,860
a muscle that they can use in
all kinds of life situations.

763
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,989
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's so
great. And I think that you've

764
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:46,860
hit on this idea a couple of
times of its, its practice,

765
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,460
right? You know, it might seem
effortless that you see somebody

766
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,550
doing something, but it's
because they have practice these

767
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,619
things over and over. And it
takes growth and it takes time

768
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,849
and effort. But

769
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,070
Gant: yeah, always be growing.
He always be growing. What What,

770
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,309
what book are you reading,
that's, that's challenging you

771
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:12,929
what, you know, blog posts, are
you writing that's challenging

772
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:17,340
you? What's the next thing if
you're not, I mean, I know this

773
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,280
is like the oldest and everybody
hates hearing it. But if you're

774
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,389
not growing, you're dying. And I
really do believe that it's

775
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:29,760
important for you to be, you
know, we've got so much time

776
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:35,130
with a very, very sharp
intellect. And we tend to waste

777
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,110
that, you know, for our first 28
years of our life, some people

778
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,690
really kind of get there. But
for the rest of the time,

779
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,989
you're, you're sort of like
crystallizing new thoughts and

780
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:50,190
ideas and bringing those in. And
I love that because, you know,

781
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:54,179
you could do that till, you
know, the day you die, you can

782
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,539
always be getting these new
thoughts and kind of adding new

783
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:01,949
skills and getting new updates
and improving who you are. And

784
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:08,400
it's a little bit like as if I
add a new word today, or new

785
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,880
word a week, you know, I've got
52, amazing, cool new ways to

786
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,670
express myself a year. If I add
new concepts, I'm finding new

787
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,840
ways to express myself. And I'm
getting new nouns and new

788
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,460
neurons that I can hold ideas
and that normally I was unable

789
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:35,969
to hold before. So I'm a
relentless self improver, I buy

790
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:39,510
books, and then sometimes they
can be just brought down to one

791
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,570
paragraph, you know, I know
this, you read the whole book,

792
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,010
and you're like, I was one
paragraph, just just to say

793
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:53,039
this, and then ignore the book.
But I'll still, you know, that

794
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,860
one paragraph of perfectly
usable, well identified,

795
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,739
information is locked in your
brain forever, because you read

796
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:04,650
that whole book, and you'll be
able to reference it and use it

797
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:09,809
for the rest of your life. So I
think that these are, it is

798
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:12,900
practice, and one of the most
beautiful things we can do is

799
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,920
constantly improve.

800
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:17,170
Dan Ott: I...my...so one
question was like, how do you

801
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,280
personally manage, like, the
learning along with obviously

802
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,119
doing work, and he seemed to be
doing, you know, like mixing in

803
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,969
your side projects, and
everything else that you have

804
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:31,300
going on? Plus, you know, family
and all that stuff? Do you have

805
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,010
a specific method or anything?

806
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:39,329
Gant: For me, I combo things as
much as possible. And some

807
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:42,840
people absolutely love it. And
some people, there are certain

808
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,940
situations where it's like, No,
you don't combo this, right? You

809
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,280
don't, you wouldn't go to a
recital, and then like, check

810
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,550
your emails, right, bad combo.
But if you've got to learn a new

811
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:01,260
technology, and you've got like
a marketing task, and you have a

812
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,030
cool idea that you want to work
on, well, if you build that new

813
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,590
idea into that new technology,
yeah, it might take you three

814
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,210
times as long. But you're,
you're kind of like building

815
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,230
your resume, or you're kind of
adding a marketing concept. And

816
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,329
so you kind of combo these
things, and then you want to get

817
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:25,500
as much out of those as
possible. As a developer, I tend

818
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,130
to not so for instance, I've
mentioned like so I just wrote a

819
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:35,190
book, write my intuition is to
shut the hell up and have said

820
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:40,829
that once I set up wrote a book,
I put it in, I pinned the tweet.

821
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,059
Didn't I do like all the
marketing, right? That's, that's

822
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:47,969
your intuition. That's my
intuition is how we can just The

823
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:53,190
truth is, I have to force like,
other things I have to

824
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,860
constantly like, you know, fit
those things. So here, take a

825
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,159
look at this. I'm on this
amazing podcast. I'm interested

826
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:01,380
in you know, I'm talking about
All these cool concepts, and

827
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,829
then boom, guess what I'm
opening my spreadsheet of

828
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:08,940
marketing drips. And I'm saying
mentioned the book, boom combo

829
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:15,000
move. So there's kind of stuff
there. I think I think finding

830
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,329
proper combinations of things is
going to give you what is like

831
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,579
attractive to go after, as well.
Like this serves like all these

832
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,199
different kinds of things.
That's what I always loved about

833
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,500
computers, like you could leave
them running. And they're always

834
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,039
crunching numbers and collecting
emails and solving problems in

835
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,340
the background back, I want to
say, a billion and a half years

836
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,000
ago, I might be off by a little
bit. There was a screensaver

837
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,309
that used to like, try to help
identify radio signals and space

838
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,639
member SETI. And so one of the
things is like your computer

839
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,800
when it went dormant, used to
like try to help identify

840
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,099
signals to spread. I love that,
you know, like, when I'm not

841
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,639
using it, it's working on this
cool thing. This is of course,

842
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:09,059
before crypto, because who has
an extra? Now, we'd come up with

843
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,969
that idea, then just like,
Alright, everybody's gonna mind

844
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,190
crypto for us now. I mean, now
they're shoving it in the

845
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,039
JavaScript. So it's doing in the
background of webpages, right.

846
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:24,929
But it's, I think it's about
finding, finding situations,

847
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,570
partnerships, interactions,
where you can have a lot of the

848
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,929
things that you want all kind of
come together, and making sure

849
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:37,260
that you're pushing yourself to
get all the juice out of every

850
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,059
single piece of fruit, you you
get better at squeezing it out,

851
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,989
you get better at using every
piece of it, you become a chef,

852
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:49,559
you know of, Okay, I'm going to
cut this part over here, but

853
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,530
these skins are gonna go over
there and be flavoring for that

854
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,099
I'm gonna leave this in the pan
for this. And like this weird

855
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:01,920
sort of combination in this 3d
math starts to come out. That's

856
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,909
when you know, you're getting
more value out of your time. And

857
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:08,789
I think that's what we're really
worried about, because I spend a

858
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:12,480
lot of time doing something that
has low value. And then if I

859
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,480
could do something that does a
whole bunch of things. For me,

860
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:22,110
that's a high value thing. And
those aren't easy to figure out.

861
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:27,690
And I think they're very per
person. But that's my favorite

862
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,630
thing. If I can find something
that hits a bunch of different

863
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:35,849
plus signs. I'm like, Yes, I
deserve this dopamine.

864
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,460
Dan Ott: That's awesome. I like
that I like this sort of

865
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,969
intentional, you know, approach
to that, that sort of thing.

866
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:48,030
Because I always have a billion
different things going on, you

867
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:52,409
know, and trying to like, review
and figure out how to pull them

868
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,269
all together, you know, and do
some different, you know,

869
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,030
overlaps in different circles or
whatever. I think that's I think

870
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,960
that's a great approach.

871
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,780
Gant: Yeah. Venn diagramming, I
guess, is like, it's the Venn

872
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,139
diagram of life here. Like what
things can I do to have the most

873
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:13,199
impact and in my, and here's a
trick. learn to say no to the

874
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,519
things that don't. So you have
all these things, that Venn

875
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,469
diagram, you have five to 10
things on this list that are

876
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:27,300
huge impact. The 10 things
underneath that are evil,

877
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:32,190
attractive things that you want
to do that are low impact things

878
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,710
that don't move the needle that
don't do anything, you have to

879
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,460
cut those those are those your
do not do list at the top as you

880
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,909
do list. And you say no to the
things that go that serve the

881
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:44,280
bottom, you say yes to the
things that serve at the top.

882
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:53,550
Dan Ott: I like that. Got to
figure out how to say no to a

883
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:58,260
different question. That's a
whole nother podcast episode...

884
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:02,730
Gant: "Saying no, the episode."

885
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,480
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We do. We
need that episode. I think I get

886
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,150
you and I met one time and you
said yeah, one of the things you

887
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,320
said to me was when you say yes
to something, you're saying no

888
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,900
to 100 other things or something
like that. And I was like...yeah

889
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:30,309
Dan Ott: yeah. I think we're
Yeah, pretty much there, right?

890
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:32,860
Gant: yeah, Right.

891
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,380
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. Yes.
I was. thinking through all

892
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,099
these things now.

893
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,920
Gant: That's good. That's good.
There's a there was this artist

894
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,030
who went on stage and he played
and then after he played, no one

895
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:55,260
applauded. And so he felt really
bad. And then the person said,

896
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:59,429
they're they're still
emotionally feeling what

897
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,150
happened there. So it's okay. So
I was like, whenever I say

898
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,369
something, there's like silence
afterward. That's what I tell

899
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:09,210
myself. But hey, people are
thinking about what you just

900
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:15,630
said. That's okay. Yeah. Versus,
you know, you have this inner

901
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:21,690
cynic that I've fortunately been
able to kill, or like, subdue,

902
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,019
which is the one that was like,
Hey, no one said anything. What

903
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:29,039
did you do? Why is there
silence? It is certain people

904
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,090
who have to feel silence, they
that cynics winning for them, if

905
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:37,440
you can have a pleasant pause in
the conversation, those are

906
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,780
people who you are actually
talking to. And that's a

907
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,920
friendly conversation.

908
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,789
Dan Ott: I, I'm glad you said
that. This this, I mean, this,

909
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,900
this happens to me in our
podcast recordings often, right?

910
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,050
where somebody will say
something like, meaningful, or

911
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,960
we'll just like, start, you
know, my brain will start going

912
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,349
on that. But then also need to,
like host the pack, you know,

913
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:04,559
it's the exact same exact thing
happens where there's just

914
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,809
silence because I'm just like,
we're both just like, Whoa, you

915
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:10,469
know, just like thinking, yeah,
then we have to remember like,

916
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,510
Alright, we're like podcast
hosts.

917
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:17,010
Gant: Wait, is this thing on?
Where am I?

918
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,190
I know that that definitely
happens, you know. And I think,

919
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,960
there, there are lots of signs
that have picked up that, you

920
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,239
know, like, when this
conversation, we're not happy,

921
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,090
we're not afraid to go down a
path. And that just makes it

922
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,880
such a friendly conversation.
You know, if you had like a

923
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,360
rigid agenda, and like, it was
like, we go to this point, this

924
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,119
point, this point, this point,
like, oh, man, when somebody is

925
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,480
listening, this podcast, it's
gonna feel forced or that y'all

926
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,989
don't do that. I really
appreciate it. It's like, I you

927
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:52,980
know, if I had started talking
about Dwayne Johnson for 15

928
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,860
minutes after the zombie
apocalypse conversation, I think

929
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,260
y'all would have let me and I
appreciate that a lot.

930
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,699
Dan Ott: Yeah, no, we almost
went down that road. I was close

931
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:03,489
and then I think Bekah started
moving on. So it's probably

932
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,030
good, but

933
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:09,610
Gant: That's good. We.. "The
Rock, the Podcast"

934
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I love
tangents. tangents are my

935
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,420
favorite.

936
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,518
Gant: Yeah, yes, indeed.

937
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,869
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, well,
I think this has been a really

938
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:30,780
great episode, you, we covered a
lot of stuff that was really

939
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,980
important and really meaningful.
And now everybody gets to have a

940
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,369
glimpse of what it's like to
have you as their personal Yoda.

941
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:47,699
So thank you so much for being
here with us, we will drop all

942
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:51,389
of your links in the show notes.
But is there anything else that

943
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:53,880
you're working on that you would
like to plug right now

944
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:59,659
Gant: I'll just say that I
really am lucky enough to work

945
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:05,780
at a company Infinite Red, where
we, we really have a huge

946
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,230
footprint. And I'm really
excited because we work in the

947
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,929
React Native space. So we build
mobile apps and stuff like that.

948
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,159
And I work with a lot of other
Yodas there. A lot of really

949
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,530
friendly people who, who could
easily go off to work for

950
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:25,730
Microsoft, Google, Facebook,
like they could go to a fortune

951
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:30,920
500 tomorrow. And I think that
I'm in a place in my life where

952
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,030
I get to choose my company and
who I'm around. And I'm around

953
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,730
other people who do the same
thing. And they kind of choose

954
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,579
us. So we're a real fun company
for explaining stuff, working

955
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:48,139
with stuff and building
technology. And I'll say that,

956
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:51,530
like, I appreciate them for
supporting me on going on

957
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:55,699
podcasts, as well as like how
cool it is to kind of come in

958
01:03:55,699 --> 01:04:01,280
and work for us as well. We have
a careers application for people

959
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,179
that we don't usually push too
much now. But we're at the point

960
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:10,400
where we have to grow. So it's
at careers dot infinite dot red.

961
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,489
So if you want to work with us
feel free to apply. They're

962
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:17,719
currently only hiring US and
Canada. We're being extra picky.

963
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,199
And then also, if you want to
work with us, and a consulting

964
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:28,699
standpoint, just Hello at
infinite dot read and we'll send

965
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,579
somebody your way immediately.
Start talking about your app,

966
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:35,329
and you'll get to meet our CTO
and our CEO. And like, you know,

967
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:43,010
we don't even have sales people.
Just a group of group of people

968
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,710
having fun and building great
stuff.

969
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:47,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
that's awesome.

970
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,809
Dan Ott: Yeah, Infinite Red is
very cool. Sorry, I didn't mean

971
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:54,809
to interrupt. I just, I've been
an admirer of Infinite Red for a

972
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:55,469
long time. So

973
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,599
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah, I've
met two out of Three of the

974
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,829
owners, so

975
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,429
Gant: Oh yeah,

976
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:03,570
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Still
waiting for that third.

977
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:08,400
Gant: Yeah, you gotta meet Todd,
he's he is he is a bundle of

978
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,210
fun. He focuses internally
constantly, we call him our

979
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:19,920
internal glue. He is, first to
comment on something, the person

980
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,489
anybody goes to if they like,
they feel like they need to talk

981
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:28,739
to somebody. Because he's, you
know, like, I guess you could

982
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:31,619
talk to me, if you're talking
about career stuff and things

983
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:35,190
like that. Todd knows what
everybody did this weekend. He

984
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,000
knows what everybody did this
weekend. And he's, he's gonna

985
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,489
show you what he did, you know,
and to have that as a CEO, is

986
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,480
like, great for trying to be
like a humanizing sort of

987
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,989
company. We care a lot about
what, what's going on, and

988
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,440
people, well, not what's going
on in your life, but like, how

989
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,099
you're doing, you know, and how
we are part of like, what's

990
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:02,849
going on there. And I know that
people are super anti, saying,

991
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:06,420
like, we're a family kind of
thing. We're not, we're not a

992
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:13,110
family, but we sure treat you as
a human being and as like a

993
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:17,010
friend and we, we help you with
things. So like Todd, if you

994
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:21,690
meet him, he's, he's gonna
attach and just like find out

995
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,730
like what you're doing this
weekend and stuff like that.

996
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,199
He's super cool. So we try to
reserve his energies to internal

997
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:30,630
but he, you could definitely
reach out and talk to him. He's

998
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:31,079
super cool.

999
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,539
