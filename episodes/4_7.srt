00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:09,147
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
season four, episode seven of the

2
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:13,928
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,437
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:20,077
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,987
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:26,018
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:29,047
you here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

8
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:33,795
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we had
a great time hanging out with

9
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,426
Jessica Wilkins. Jessica is a
self-taught developer and staff

10
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:41,265
author for the freeCodeCamp news
publication. Jessica talked about

11
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,115
how to get started with tech
writing, how to differentiate

12
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:49,155
between constructive criticism
and negative feedback. And how to

13
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,716
avoid things like gatekeeping in
your tech writing by eliminating

14
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,886
assumptions about your audience.
And avoiding terms. Uh, like

15
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,786
"it's so easy" and "just do
this." Uh, she gave some tips,

16
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,695
like adding a prerequisites to
your posts or, uh, other

17
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:10,635
resources. Um, Basically, um,
Outlined her entire process for

18
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:13,846
all of her tech writing that she
does. And, uh, she does a lot of

19
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,995
it and it's all pretty awesome.
Um it was a really great

20
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,906
conversation and i know you were
going to enjoy it

21
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,867
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

22
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:25,987
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

23
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:29,677
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

24
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:40,533
you enjoy this episode. My name
is Bekah. I am a front end

25
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,222
developer from a small town in
Ohio, and my favorite childhood

26
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,722
movie was Beauty and the Beast.

27
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:51,343
Dan: That's a good one. Hi, my
name is Dan. I am a front end

28
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:56,143
developer from Cleveland, Ohio.
And, um, yeah, my, my favorite

29
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:59,173
movie is Star Wars. Um, I think
if I had to pick one, it would,

30
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,352
it would be Return of the Jedi.
Um, yeah. As, as a child, I

31
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,692
watched that. just, just a lot.
So it's easy choice for me.

32
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,668
Bekah: The solid choice.

33
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:13,638
Jessica: Sounds pretty good. Hi,
I am Jessica Wilkins and I am a

34
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:17,418
musician learning how to code. I
am also a technical writer for

35
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:21,948
freeCodeCamp News. my favorite
movie was actually the Toy Story

36
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:25,788
movies. And so the original one,
but all four of them are amazing.

37
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:29,923
Dan: Those are on big rotation at
our house with, with our kids.

38
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:32,103
Uh, we also enjoy them. They're
solid.

39
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,818
Jessica: I totally cried. When
Andy went to college, I bawled

40
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:38,877
like a little baby. I was like,
oh my gosh, he can't leave. And

41
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,568
then he was giving his toys to
the little girl. I'm like, I

42
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:43,728
mean, teary-eyed now.

43
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:43,948
Dan: Yes.

44
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:44,518
Jessica: ya know?

45
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,867
Dan: I actually tried to
discourage that. That's I started

46
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,048
three. I tried to actually
discourage Toy Story 3 just

47
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,298
because it. It's very good. It's
about it is emotionally, uh,

48
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:52,867
affecting

49
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:53,747
Jessica: Right,

50
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,397
Dan: absolutely.

51
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,752
Bekah: my oldest is 12 and he'll
look at me and be like, are you

52
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,272
crying? yes.

53
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,902
Jessica: It's very sad. We grew
up with Andy.

54
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,492
Dan: Dude, I entertainment. Like
it takes on a whole new slant

55
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,402
when, especially when you have
kids. Cause like I just find

56
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,223
myself being, you know, uh,
affected by this stuff in

57
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,342
different ways, you know? And
it's like, I don't it's matter.

58
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:16,733
It's cool.

59
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:23,117
Bekah: It's been wild rereading
novels. I read. As like a young

60
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:29,867
adult to my kids. I, because I
always young adult fiction and I

61
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:35,027
always loved the young adult
character. Right. And now as a

62
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:40,068
parent, when I read it, I with
the parents and the novels and

63
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,707
I'm like, oh, they don't
understand what they're doing to

64
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:47,867
their parents. So, yeah, it's
very different, lots of crying

65
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,358
and young adult novel reading.

66
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:53,043
Dan: Yeah. at some point I
realized it with Calvin and

67
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,342
Hobbes. I was a big Calvin and
Hobbes fan Growing up and found

68
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,492
myself recently, you know,
identifying much more with

69
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:02,962
parents.

70
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,872
Bekah: Um, welcome. Jessica is so
great to have you here with us

71
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:12,002
today, because we did a lunch and
learn recently with Jessica and

72
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,823
we'll put the link to that in the
show notes. And she did such a

73
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:19,773
good job about talking us through
writing and writing career. And

74
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,072
it is our monthly challenge this
month, every month we hold a

75
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,492
monthly challenge, in the
community is welcome to do it.

76
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:30,468
And this is. The one-year
anniversary of when we started

77
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:34,098
monthly challenges. And so it's
one of my favorites. It's the

78
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:38,148
blog writing challenge and it's
based off of NaNoWriMo national

79
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:44,867
novel writing month. And so
Jessica is just an amazing

80
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,017
writer. And we kicked off the
blogging challenge and our goal

81
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,757
was hit 50,000 words. That's
what, uh, as a community, that's

82
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:58,367
what it was last year. We didn't
quite make it. We almost made it,

83
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:03,348
this year the, today is Tuesday,
November 9th. We have already

84
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,408
have we, where are we at? We're
past halfway.

85
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:10,367
Jessica: I think we're at 27,000,
I think. Yeah.

86
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,307
Bekah: and largely in part due to
Jessica

87
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:15,452
Dan: Yep. Over well, over 28,000.
Yeah.

88
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:16,208
Jessica: Oh, cool.

89
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:20,567
Bekah: So extra happy to have you
here to talk about this challenge

90
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,197
with us. But before we jump into
that, we always like to get your

91
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:28,487
origin story and you have a
awesome one. So tell us a little

92
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,517
bit about how you got to this
point your career.

93
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:36,603
Jessica: Yeah. it's definitely
unique there. So I grew up in

94
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,692
Southern California. I grew up in
a town called Palm Springs, which

95
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:44,733
is like two hours south of Los
Angeles in California there. And,

96
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:49,802
uh, grew up with a single mom who
was a teacher. And so. Uh, I got

97
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:54,213
into a music pretty early at
seven, and then just kind of

98
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,822
stuck with it. And it pretty
early on, I decided I'm going to

99
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,632
be a professional musician. Uh,
and so I started with piano and

100
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:04,562
then I at 11 started learning the
oboe, which is like a woodwind

101
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,642
instrument. And I. At first
didn't really like it. Cause I

102
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:09,752
didn't sound that good at it,

103
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:10,757
Dan: Yeah.

104
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:13,442
Jessica: then I started to kind
of get into it. I was like, okay,

105
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,723
cool. So then I started doing
like festivals and private

106
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:19,202
lessons and all that fun stuff.
And I decided like 15, I'm going

107
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:23,762
to go, try to go to music school
or conservatory. And go down that

108
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:27,273
route and be a classical
professional musician. so, uh,

109
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:31,142
when I graduated from college or
from high school, I went on to

110
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:35,343
Eastman School of Music, which is
in Rochester, New York, uh, and

111
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:39,002
study there for four years on
oboe performance. And then I

112
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,093
graduated and went on to a
Master's at University of

113
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:47,273
Michigan, which is in Ann Arbor.
and then after that, I decided to

114
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:50,478
Southern California because the
cold was just not agreeing with

115
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,228
me. So after six years of really
cold weather, I was like, no hard

116
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,517
pass. Let's go back to Southern
California. So I came back and

117
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:03,048
decided that I wanted to start my
own sheet music company and run

118
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:08,362
that. And then also, uh, perform
and freelance and so. Uh, from

119
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:14,723
2015 to 2020, uh, all I did was
perform and record and run my

120
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,413
sheet music company and teach.
And so I was kind of busy with

121
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:23,723
all that fun stuff. And then 2020
happened and everything changed.

122
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:28,642
So for everybody, but me, it was
just okay, go home. And there's

123
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:32,028
no work for you. and I'm like
Great. So what am I supposed to

124
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:36,317
do now? So I just worked on the
business and try to keep that

125
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:40,668
going and afloat and changing
there, for a few months. But then

126
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,617
in June of 2020, um, you know, US
was going through a lot with

127
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:50,377
COVID and then race relations
with the George Floyd murder And

128
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,093
so a lot of people were talking
about diversity issues within

129
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,913
many industries, including
myself, right? My industry with

130
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,182
the classical world of operas and
orchestras, cause there's a huge

131
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:04,382
diversity problem, with, uh, with
black representation, especially.

132
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:08,473
And so people were asking me.
Yeah. Can you give me information

133
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:13,122
about composers I can learn about
so we can start to change. And I

134
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,103
decided there should be a
website. Like there should just

135
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,673
be one place where people can
find all this stuff. I, I was

136
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:22,213
like, well, maybe could build it.
I've never built anything. I've

137
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,543
never coded before, but Hey,
we've got all this time, so maybe

138
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:29,892
we'll learn and see what happens.
So that's how I got into

139
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,942
programming and been doing this
for about a year and a half now.

140
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:39,732
Yeah, so that's kind of my origin
story and how I got into, where

141
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,182
I'm at now.

142
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,023
Bekah: awesome. Does that site
still exist out there?

143
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:49,133
Jessica: So I created, um,
version one about six months into

144
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,432
my learning and it's called the
Black Excellence Music Project.

145
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:58,222
And I built that with HTML, CSS,
and Vanilla JavaScript. and then

146
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,898
I revisited it a few months ago,
um, over the summer of 2021

147
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:07,067
create a version two, which was
built with React and Tailwind

148
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:11,597
CSS, and has more artists and
more games and all of this fun

149
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:15,378
stuff. yeah, so this was always
like a passion project. And so I

150
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:19,508
got into tech I wanted to switch
careers. I thought initially in

151
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,187
June I was like, oh, this thing
will just blow over eventually.

152
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,158
And I go back to my old life and
yeah. Obviously not what

153
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:29,957
happened. I wildly miss,
understood how COVID works. I

154
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,388
totally thought this was just
going to be like a couple of

155
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:36,918
months and I was completely
wrong. So, but, and then I ended

156
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:40,727
up starting to get developer
work, uh, and that was kinda

157
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:44,238
cool. And then I started writing
for freeCodeCamp, which was also

158
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,418
kind of cool. and I was like,
well, maybe I could have a career

159
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,128
there. So yeah.

160
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:55,148
Bekah: That is so awesome. So,
um, that project is an open

161
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,018
source project, right?

162
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:00,268
Jessica: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And so
it's available on my personal

163
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:03,148
GitHub, but it's completely open
source. It's a, anybody could

164
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:08,248
like in there and if they want to
contribute there, I'm pretty open

165
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:09,957
to that. So, yeah.

166
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,847
Bekah: Right. It is really
awesome. And again, those links

167
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:21,243
will be in the show notes I just
think seem like. Uh, so driven

168
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:25,773
and motivated from everything
that you've talked about your

169
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:29,822
career as a musician, you know,
at 15 years old, you decided that

170
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:34,743
you were going to do this thing,
and that's not an easy thing. So

171
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:38,192
you have this, um, I don't know,
Tenacity or, or something. How

172
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:42,722
would you kind of describe that,
that that's allowed you to go

173
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,373
through these different things
and accomplish so much.

174
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:50,253
Jessica: I think that's in large
part to both my mom and my

175
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,302
grandmother. And so both of them
were single parents. And so one

176
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:58,743
was by choice. my mom, uh, worked
as a teacher for many years and

177
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,442
then in her forties decided that
she wanted to adopt and have a

178
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:07,982
child. Um, and so, uh, she had me
when she was like 44 or 45. And

179
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:12,452
then with my grandmother, uh, she
was married, but it was

180
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,332
unfortunately an abusive
situation. So she had to get out

181
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:19,263
and get to safety and raise two
kids by herself and was also a

182
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:24,842
teacher. but then went on to, um,
you know, own land in certain

183
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:29,373
parts of California and just be
fiercely independent. so I just

184
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,952
kind of picked up on that, where
if they decided they were going

185
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:35,852
to do something, they just went
for it. Growing up with that type

186
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,763
of mindset and energy, it's like,
well, I guess That's just what we

187
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:42,312
do here. If you just want to go
do something. so when I

188
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:46,863
discovered my love for operas and
orchestra and this weird,

189
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,013
beautiful instrument of the oboe,
I was like, I want to go do that

190
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:54,633
I want to go achieve that. And so
I just went for it definitely

191
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:59,253
didn't think I was going to get
in to. The conservatory I was, it

192
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,173
ended up working out thankfully,
but leading up to it cause I got

193
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:08,903
four rejections and then the last
one was an exception into my

194
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,673
dream schools. So at first I was
like, well maybe I'll just start

195
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:15,423
going to college. I have four
rejections from other schools.

196
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,232
But then at the very end I was
accepted, uh, to Eastman. And

197
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,423
that was the last school I heard
back from. And I was like, okay,

198
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,702
cool. I guess we're going. And
we're going to my dream school.

199
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,633
So that worked out.

200
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:30,268
Dan: awesome. Oh, um, the oboe is
an interesting choice. What, uh,

201
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:33,057
w w do you have any reason why,
like, what made you like lean

202
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,427
towards the oboe, I know from,
you know, I, I know it's very

203
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,587
hard to learn and all of that
stuff. I was just curious about

204
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:37,768
that.

205
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,638
Jessica: so I didn't actually
choose it. Um,

206
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:41,388
Dan: Sure.

207
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:46,217
Jessica: I didn't choose it.
Yeah. um, I was learning piano in

208
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:50,052
elementary school, and then I
tried to pick up trumpet. That

209
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,993
definitely was not the right fit
for me. I couldn't really make

210
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:56,562
any type of sounds, but I wanted
to be in band because all my

211
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:00,913
friends were in band and I loved
music. so I asked the, uh, band

212
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,102
director at the middle school and
I told him, I said, Hey, I'm

213
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:06,263
really passionate. I want to
learn something. his answer was,

214
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:10,182
you should learn the oboe. And
I'm like, Okay. what is that? He

215
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:13,383
was like here. And so he got out
and oboe and he got out of reed

216
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:18,567
he put it together for me and put
it, he said, okay, this is. You

217
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,658
know, blow and just how you make
an abasured. And I did that and

218
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,998
it squeaked, he's like perfect.
You should be our new oboe

219
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:28,158
player. I was like, Okay, cool.
And I'm like 11 years old, so

220
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:32,327
I've just game for anything. And
he probably totally planned that.

221
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,878
Like, yes, we got another one
because oboe's so rare in

222
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:41,057
schools, along with like basoon.
So that's when he heard that I

223
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,427
was, I just wanted to join and
he's like, cool. Let's just talk

224
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:47,408
her into playing this thing. And
we're all taken care of, but I

225
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,998
guess I have to thank him for it
because I ended up falling in

226
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:50,957
love with it. So.

227
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,008
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah,
I imagine there was, there was no

228
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,508
oboe player, you know, before he
started.

229
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:59,557
Jessica: Yeah, there was actually
just one, but then he was like,

230
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:04,927
we really need one other one. And
so it was easy to talk at 11 year

231
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,148
old, because at that age, you're
just like, I just want to do

232
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,908
anything and you're not going to
like fight it there, so.

233
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,932
Bekah: Oldest is learning their
trombone because someone gave us

234
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:13,773
a free trombone.

235
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,618
Jessica: see, there you go. Yeah,
exactly. That's how, like most

236
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,717
kids fall into it. They're like,
I don't know. Just give me an

237
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:20,187
instrument. I'll figure it out.

238
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:27,222
Bekah: Yeah, that is awesome. And
so it's great to hear to your

239
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:31,602
you've had this history of
teaching in your family, it

240
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:35,052
sounds like you also taught
music, but you're also teaching

241
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,393
now through what you're doing.
You know, you did the lunch and

242
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:41,653
learn for us and taught us all
about writing, but also as you're

243
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:46,302
writing, you're teaching. So, how
much of that do you think that,

244
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,557
you're able to lean on. What
you've learned from your mom and

245
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,447
your grandmother, um, or is it
something that you thought you

246
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,238
really had to work hard to
acquire that skill?

247
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:05,302
Jessica: Yeah, I you know what I
was teaching beginners, there's a

248
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:09,113
lot of patience required when
you're teaching beginner

249
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:12,232
students, especially beginner
oboist, because it's like a

250
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:15,748
really weird instrument and
there's not a little. Unnatural

251
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,807
things with it. And so it
requires a lot of patience and

252
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,658
just saying, okay, let's just
take it one step at a time. And

253
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,498
so I think that translates a lot
into the articles I write. Now I

254
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,697
write a lot of beginner articles
on HTML and CSS and JavaScript

255
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:34,018
and tutorials and all that fun
stuff. And so I know what it's

256
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,607
like. First start out in
programming. And I think a lot of

257
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:41,807
writers just skip over stuff and
they'll skip like 20 steps where

258
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,118
they're writing about something
and they'll go, oh yeah, first

259
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,057
you do this. And then when you
log in, just take care of this

260
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,008
and then go over here and I'm
like, wait, wait, wait a minute.

261
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:52,638
Like, how is a beginner supposed
to kind of fill in those gaps?

262
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:55,248
And so I really try to be
conscious about explaining

263
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:59,477
things, not assuming anything,
being patient there, I think that

264
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:04,633
goes into my writing. Um, cause I
just want to help people as best

265
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,293
as I can.

266
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:12,077
Bekah: That's so important
because the, it. It really helps

267
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:17,658
to create a more welcoming and
inclusive space in tech to have.

268
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:24,077
Tutorials or guides or articles
that don't make assumptions about

269
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:28,727
the people who are reading them.
I can't tell you how many times I

270
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:33,288
started reading something and got
very frustrated because I was

271
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:37,812
following the steps. But it
wasn't working and I didn't know

272
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:41,863
what to do or what to look for.
And that can be really hard to

273
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:45,582
navigate through, especially
you're self-taught or you don't

274
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:50,173
have a good support system. So I
really appreciate hearing you

275
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,592
talk about making sure that
that's part of your process.

276
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:58,038
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's
just like the person came to

277
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:01,727
learn. And so when you're just
skipping steps or saying, oh,

278
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:04,307
what are the things too? That's a
pet peeve is when people say, oh,

279
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:08,748
it's so easy. You just do this.
You can't say that. Like a lot of

280
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,788
people do this when they're
setting up, like get hub for the

281
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,242
first time and they'll say, oh
yeah, This up and you just run

282
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,403
these commands, just open up
your, your. terminal. It's

283
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,252
totally fine. And, and there you
go. And it's like, no, it's not

284
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:22,583
totally fine. This is brand new
for a lot of people. So you've

285
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,643
got to walk through those steps
and throw in some screenshots

286
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:29,692
make sure that people can follow
along. Cause it might be easy for

287
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:32,063
somebody that's been doing it for
many, many years, but when you're

288
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,613
first learning it, you're going,
wait, where's my terminal.

289
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:38,002
Where's my command prompt. How do
I type, do I type this in first

290
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,313
and then do this? Or this is very
confusing. So.

291
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,623
Bekah: Yeah, I'll never forget.
It's one of the first times I

292
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:47,702
paired with somebody is somebody
that I really like admired in the

293
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,542
industry. And I was terrified
because I didn't know. And at

294
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:56,012
that point I hadn't really been
using. Uh, VS Code or, or

295
00:17:56,012 --> 00:18:01,952
anything like that. And so okay,
um, can you open up a text

296
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:06,843
editor? And I had no idea what
that word meant. And so I opened

297
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:11,462
up Google docs and, they like, of
went with it. And then eventually

298
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:15,313
they were like, do you have
something like VS Code or Atom.

299
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:22,548
oh, a text editor. like, Things
like that, you know, I didn't

300
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:22,718
know.

301
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:22,807
Jessica: Right.

302
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:27,528
Bekah: I hadn't seen it written
before and I was using built-in,

303
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,657
things with the lessons that I
was learning. I remember just

304
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:37,278
that sense of shame that didn't
belong there. Right. I shouldn't

305
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:41,357
be ashamed in that moment, but
when you feel like there are

306
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:45,633
assumptions like, oh, I should
have known that. And it's not

307
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:49,623
true. So to have people breaking
things down to avoid, that makes

308
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,472
it much easier for people to keep
learning.

309
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:57,442
Jessica: Yeah, exactly. Cause I
mean, people want to learn and,

310
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,363
and I think writing is just such
an important skill. I think

311
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:04,712
everybody should write and work
on writing. And I think there's

312
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,353
just two levels. There's writing
technical articles and then

313
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:10,113
there's also writing about your
personal story. And so the cool

314
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:13,113
thing about this monthly
challenge is I get to do both is

315
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:15,722
I get to focus on some technical
stuff and then I get to talk

316
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:20,012
about, some weird stories I have
some fun articles coming up there

317
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,782
and just kind of sharing my story
there.

318
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:29,798
Dan: Yeah, I think that's
awesome. That balance of, of, you

319
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,448
know, not making assumptions
about your audience and, um, but

320
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:36,788
also still kind of getting your
point across for the thing you're

321
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,278
trying to learn is, is a, is a
hard balance to strike and I

322
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:44,387
think you do it well. there, is
there anything. If somebody was

323
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:49,067
starting a technical article, you
know, I mean, w what advice would

324
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:52,728
you give? Like, you know, say the
thing that I wanted to learn or

325
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:56,657
that I wanted to, you know,
teach, uh, required to GitHub,

326
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:59,117
you know, required you to check
out a repository and all of that

327
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:03,887
stuff. you say, like, would you
suggest putting all that stuff

328
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:09,093
step-by-step in or linking to.
Articles about, you know, about

329
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,982
how to do that and that kind of
thing. Like what, what kind of

330
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,202
approach, you know, generally
would you would you suggest?

331
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:17,438
Jessica: Yeah. So I think it's
fine if they're. Uh, if you want

332
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:20,327
to Link an article, or if you
want to have a right at the very

333
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:23,778
top of your articles, just say,
prerequisites must be familiar

334
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:27,768
with and GitHub. Um, I mean, I
just wrote an article about, uh,

335
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,067
how to work with Node and
NodeMailer for emails. And so I

336
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,857
had a prerequisite say, okay, I'm
not going to cover basic

337
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,688
JavaScript. So it's important.
That you understand some of the

338
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,538
basic concepts and the basics
behind nodes. So we can dive

339
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:44,708
straight into this. And there was
one section there's a different

340
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,847
setup with how to do Google with
NodeMailer and set up all the,

341
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:52,448
off the authentication there. And
so I did link to another

342
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,938
freeCodeCamp article and say,
okay, here's a detailed

343
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,518
step-by-step process. If you're
going to use google with

344
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:00,428
NodeMailer, otherwise you could
walk through the steps that I'm

345
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,768
going to show you here. So I
think that's completely fine.

346
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,893
There were, if you feel like you
could write through. Um, all of

347
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,952
those steps in the article, I
think either approach works

348
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:12,563
there. Um, but I, I think it's
healthy to have like a

349
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,222
prerequisites if necessary, just
to let everybody know, Hey, if

350
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,192
you don't have these
prerequisites, that is going to

351
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,432
be kind of hard to follow,
especially for some of the

352
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,853
tutorials, because I see a lot of
people have freeCodeCamp, go

353
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,482
through a lot of our Python
tutorials, which assume you have

354
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:33,387
some basic knowledge, but they're
not acknowledging that you have,

355
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:36,807
uh, that basic knowledge. And so
they'll come to the forum and

356
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:39,057
they'll go, how do I do this? Or
why does it say I have an

357
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,518
indentation error? And so we'll
tell them, like, you're doing

358
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:43,708
crazy things with your
indentation. You can't do that in

359
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,948
Python, but they won't know that
because they just started coding

360
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:50,278
Python like two days ago. And
they're trying to build like a

361
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,143
Discord bot. And so just a
properly communicating. Like,

362
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:58,613
this is not necessarily a
beginner or if it is like, some

363
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:01,583
walkthrough steps that you can go
through. Here's a great article

364
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,853
that lays it out. so I, I think
that's completely fine there.

365
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,413
Dan: Ah, I love that, that, um,
prerequisites, you know, is, I

366
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:11,113
think that's a great, a great way
to set expectations for the, you

367
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:13,663
know, for the article. Right. And
then you don't get down three

368
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:19,022
paragraphs in and. Um, assuming
you read prerequisites, you know?

369
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:22,288
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I try to
make it obviously, you know? a

370
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,488
headache, like here you go.

371
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,262
Dan: Right, right.

372
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:28,167
Jessica: So if someone misses it,
it's like, okay, well, I did try

373
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:28,557
to warn you.

374
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:31,373
Dan: Yeah, exactly. I think
that's great advice. Yeah.

375
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:37,097
Bekah: Yeah, I think too, it's
almost a really good convention

376
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:42,647
to build into something so I
could see, um, Like software that

377
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:47,928
hosts tech blogging, like, uh,
tech blogging platforms. be

378
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:52,938
really nice if that was built in.
what are the prerequisites? And

379
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,508
then you can click the thing or
you can add the thing then that

380
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:02,147
way it already, everybody knows
where they should look Okay. This

381
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,238
is what I need to know. I don't
know those things. And it also

382
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:09,887
puts it in the writer's mind that
it makes it obvious to them to

383
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:15,657
think about. It makes it a
deliberate decision to recognize

384
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:20,667
who their audience is what they
should already know coming into

385
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,178
this. So I think like from both
perspectives, it would be really

386
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:29,127
useful in helping us to have
these conversations about, what

387
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,577
content is usable, usable for
different audiences.

388
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:37,153
Jessica: Right. And then there's
some tutorials where people label

389
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:42,073
it beginner, but it's clearly
isn't beginner. I'm like, I don't

390
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:46,303
think beginners or I wasn't doing
that. I was first starting out.

391
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:50,952
And so sometimes people really
mislabel, which hurts beginners,

392
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,143
and then they're going through
it. They're like, well, how do I

393
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,553
do this? I was like, well, maybe
we start off with something a

394
00:23:55,553 --> 00:24:01,107
little bit easier if that's okay.
So yeah, so sometimes people, I

395
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,627
think a lot of it has to do with,
they forget what it's like to be

396
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:05,198
a beginner

397
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:05,288
Dan: Yes.

398
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:07,597
Jessica: or they rewrite history
and they're like, oh, I was

399
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:10,928
totally doing this when I was
first learning in six months or a

400
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:15,008
year. And it's like, no, you
probably weren't. You probably

401
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:18,248
just forgot you weren't doing
those types of things. Cause I

402
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,633
think the first few months. Going
through a freeCodeCamp and going

403
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:25,323
through the certifications, but I
didn't understand how HTML CSS

404
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,782
and JavaScript work together. I
was just like, okay, there's

405
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,992
these things like arrays and
objects, but how do I make a

406
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,452
webpage? So I just didn't
understand how everything

407
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:38,643
connected. and so beginners,
it's, it's a lot of information

408
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,272
and it's just like fire hose. And
so you just have to make sure

409
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,242
that you're not making
assumptions going, oh yeah, you

410
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:48,212
could totally do this with your
beginner. And it's like, no. you

411
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:51,528
gotta break that down there.
That's definitely not a beginner

412
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,468
tutorial. Let's label it
intermediate at best there.

413
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:58,772
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And you
know, to your point. People could

414
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:03,173
forget, um, you know, the, what
it feels like to be a beginner at

415
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:06,123
it from experience. It's very
easy to forget that, you know, it

416
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:09,383
takes effort to that in practice.
I'm sure. You know, it becomes,

417
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:12,962
easier. but, um, yeah, it's, it's
hard to, it's hard sometimes to

418
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:16,542
put yourself back in. know, once
you're a few years into a career,

419
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:20,863
uh, to put yourself back into
spot, you know, the like total

420
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:21,792
utter confusion,

421
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,238
Jessica: Right. Exactly.

422
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:26,053
Dan: like, I, I can remember it,
you know, if I, if I make my,

423
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,053
like, if I think about it, I can
remember it, you know? And I was

424
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:30,792
at the same boat. I'm like, well,
I'm writing, you see him out

425
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,702
here. I'm like, and I was writing
like PHP at the same time. Like I

426
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:37,038
was like learning it all at the
same time and understand how they

427
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,468
all connected. And, you know,
somebody sent me a CSS file. He's

428
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,798
like instead of using whatever
use this. And I'm like, well,

429
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,928
here's a bunch of black magic.
I'm just going to drop into my

430
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:48,317
like... into my program.
apparently it works, you know, it

431
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,147
it's, uh, yeah, it can be a, a
hard thing to, to remember, but

432
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,498
an important thing for sure.

433
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:58,682
Bekah: So I want to back up a
little bit because I feel like we

434
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:04,202
miss this very impart important
part of the story of. You started

435
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,482
learning to code and suddenly
you're writing for freeCodeCamp.

436
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,113
Like that's not something little
right.

437
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,573
Jessica: totally glossed over
that. Yeah.

438
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:16,292
Bekah: accomplishment. So I don't
want to lose that. so tell us,

439
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,853
how did that happen?

440
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:22,042
Jessica: Yes, it's a crazy story,
but that's kind of my life. But

441
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,942
what ends up happening is around
October of 2020, or actually

442
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,663
September of 2020, I decided to
join the freeCodeCamp forum

443
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,452
because like a lot of self-taught
developers, you kind of bounce

444
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:36,173
around different. Uh, resources,
and then you try to find one that

445
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:38,393
works. And so I did a few
different things before

446
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:41,482
freeCodeCamp, but then I landed
on freeCodeCamp. I was like, I

447
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:44,813
kinda like this. Okay, cool. So I
started going through, the first

448
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,232
certification, which is on HTML
and CSS and responsive design.

449
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,847
And so I decided to just sign up
for the forum. I was like, maybe

450
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,407
I could connect with some
beginners that be kind of cool.

451
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:57,788
And some other developers just
talk with them. As I originally,

452
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:59,917
I just thought I would just kind
of hang in the background and

453
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:03,488
maybe jump in once in a while,
but I ended up jumping in a lot

454
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,938
more and answering questions or
just giving my perspective and

455
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,817
sharing my story. And so after
about a month of being on the

456
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:13,667
forum, Quincy reached out to me
and he was like, Hey, you're

457
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,448
super active and what's your
story? Let's talk. And so we set

458
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:20,718
up a Google Meet we talked for
about like 45 minutes, and we

459
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,897
just talked about his background
coming from a teacher into tech

460
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:27,617
and then my background with
music. And he decided, he said,

461
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:32,057
well, you should join our forum
moderator team and start writing

462
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:35,988
for freeCodeCamp is a volunteer.
Okay. I don't know what to write

463
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,008
about. Cause I've just been doing
this for like two seconds and he

464
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:43,307
said, just share your story. And
I'm like, oh, I could do that.

465
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:46,607
That sounds fun. So I decided to
just write a few posts about my

466
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,607
story so I wrote one, my first
one was about what I enjoyed

467
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:53,057
about being a beginner. I wrote
one article about the parallels

468
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:58,008
between music and. Uh, uh,
blending code and programming.

469
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:02,327
And then that was noticed by
Gatsby and they were like, Hey,

470
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,538
we have this blog and do you want
to write it? We'll pay you. I was

471
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,597
like, yeah, that sounds fun to
me. So that I wrote about

472
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:11,718
imposter syndrome and how I dealt
with it as a musician and how.

473
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,798
Yeah, it goes in with
programming. so now all of a

474
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,057
sudden I start writing articles
and just sharing my story. And

475
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:21,847
after a few months of doing that,
Quincy comes back to me and says,

476
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,817
well, I've got another
proposition for you. Um, do you

477
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:27,938
want to start writing technical
articles and we'll pay you per

478
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:32,538
article? And I was like, ah, I
don't think I could do that. So

479
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:36,048
originally I actually said no
very politely, because I just

480
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,028
didn't think I could do that.
Cause at this point this was like

481
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:42,468
six months in and we're at the
same time I had started my first

482
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:45,258
developer job, but I was still
kind of overwhelmed with that. I

483
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,897
was working part-time at this
small company. And so I was like,

484
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:51,637
I don't know if I'm qualified to
write technical articles, like

485
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,488
who is going to believe me. I, I
don't know what I'm doing. And.

486
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,768
He said, well, I, I think you
can, I think you really good at

487
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:03,327
just breaking down concepts and
could pick articles you feel

488
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,958
comfortable with. And so he had
this whole Trello board uh,

489
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,498
topics and I could just choose
which ones I felt comfortable

490
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,377
with. So I picked all the HTML,
CSS, wines, I think maybe a

491
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,127
couple of JavaScript ones, um,
and just started from there. And

492
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,488
so a few months of just writing
and getting paid per article on

493
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:26,137
my own schedule and, uh, around
July. Uh, it was interesting

494
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,887
because I was deciding if I
actually wanted this to be a

495
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:33,728
full-time career or not. And, um,
an opportunity came up with

496
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:38,428
Disney for a music job, but I
ended up turning that down to

497
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,458
pursue software

498
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:40,617
Dan: Wow.

499
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:44,347
Jessica: Yeah. Which is a whole
other story in of itself, which

500
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:47,807
we could cover. But, uh, but
yeah, so then I was like, okay, I

501
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:51,518
guess we're going into software
now I turned down that job and

502
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:54,087
then Quincy reached out again,
said, Hey, I've got a job for

503
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:58,337
you. I want you to join my team
officially you know, be, uh,

504
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,218
writing all the time. I was like,
okay, cool. So it's funny how

505
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:05,448
life works out, where one door
closes and then another one opens

506
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:09,988
around. Uh, I started officially
in August of 2021. Writing

507
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:13,057
articles and being part of the
author team. And so there's a

508
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:16,077
total of four of us. And we all
come from very diverse

509
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:19,647
backgrounds and we're located all
around the world. but he'll now

510
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,647
assign us articles. And so he'll
send us like 10 or 12 different

511
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:27,857
headlines a time. And then. we
just write. basically we research

512
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:31,127
and write. Uh, so right now I
have a whole bunch of SQL

513
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:34,698
articles and I've been learning
about that and just writing about

514
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:38,837
SQL basically as Well, as a few
more JavaScript articles that I

515
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,798
have leftover that you get to
write about. But Yeah. that's,

516
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,468
that's kinda my story. How I,
weird story, how I wound up at

517
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,288
freeCodeCamp.

518
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,692
Dan: Oh, Thats great. Yeah. And
you actually answered it at the

519
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,032
end of a question I was going to
ask was, um, you know, how to

520
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,393
balance, like, if you're, if
writing is, you know, your main

521
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,913
job, um, how to balance actually
learning, you know, whilst

522
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:59,462
writing, but it sounds like kind
of built into the job, right?

523
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:00,387
Jessica: Exactly.

524
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:01,262
Dan: very cool.

525
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,557
Jessica: Cause there's times
where I'll get assigned articles

526
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:03,617
Dan: Yeah.

527
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,548
Jessica: and I'm like, okay, I
feel comfortable about this. And

528
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:08,488
then there's times where I'm
like, I've never really worked

529
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:13,107
with this. So I guess I'll have
to learn it because I have to

530
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:16,048
write about it and convince
people that I know what I'm

531
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:19,077
talking about there, but it's
really great because I get to, we

532
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,353
all have that, where we are. One
of the authors was asked to learn

533
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:26,502
some PHP and writes a PHP
articles. Another one was asked

534
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:30,492
to write C, uh, C++, and learn
that. we're all down for just

535
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:34,363
learning, whatever we need to
learn and get the job done there.

536
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:36,893
Bekah: I love that much.

537
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,333
Dan: That's

538
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:38,678
Bekah: Sorry, go ahead.

539
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,847
Dan: That was my whole thing.
That was awesome. That sounds

540
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:42,208
awesome.

541
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:47,048
Bekah: I just kind of want to sum
up your whole timeline here of

542
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:50,942
everything that's happened
before. I think that for a lot of

543
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,962
people that we talked to,
especially people who are trying

544
00:31:54,962 --> 00:32:00,272
to transition into a tech career,
it's where to get start. And

545
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:02,373
first of all, like get
comfortable with being

546
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:07,952
uncomfortable, but also. You
finding that spot, you had this

547
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:11,173
opportunity because you
participated on freeCodeCamp

548
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:14,313
because they reached out to you
because they saw like, look,

549
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:19,083
Jessica is awesome and she's here
and she's contributing. that just

550
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:23,732
progressively led to more and
bigger and better things. And so,

551
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:28,563
you know, start with telling your
story and, writing those words

552
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,792
and this. You know, that's
largely been my blogging

553
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:36,442
experience. I rarely write very
technical things because just

554
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:41,093
want to get the words out on
paper, or it's not on paper, but

555
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:46,063
put, put it out there into the
world and that's a good place to

556
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:46,603
start.

557
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:50,012
Jessica: Yeah. I mean, there's,
everybody has a story and

558
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,192
everybody has something to talk
about and share. And so just,

559
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,163
just share with people and you'd
be surprised who reaches out. I

560
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:59,403
mean, that's how I got my first
developer job is I wasn't looking

561
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,282
for a job. I didn't think I was
anywhere close to being ready,

562
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:04,712
but this guy found me on the
forum. He's like, Hey, I'm

563
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:07,798
looking for a junior. Yeah. Uh,
junior and what,

564
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:09,123
Dan: Um,

565
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:12,597
Jessica: you want me to write
code for you? And so he's like,

566
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:16,738
yeah. And, I still work with him
to this day and it's been an

567
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:20,367
incredible learning experience,
but that came out of just being

568
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:23,548
active on the forum and just,
know, writing and talking about

569
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:24,298
my story there.

570
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,489
Bekah: Sorry. I was like, my
brain is split in two different

571
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:31,898
directions of where to go here.
Um, I'm a, Dan is you want to add

572
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,298
something before I take us off on
a tangent?

573
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,023
Dan: Nope. I would say pick the
left one.

574
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:41,473
Bekah: The left one. Okay. My
left one was, um, thinking about

575
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:45,973
your, and literally in my mind,
it was, it was on the left. your

576
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,824
career goals. I don't know if you
have career goals, but does, is

577
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,794
writing something that you want
to continue to do? Do you want to

578
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:57,344
pursue, the writing aspect of
coding or, or find yourself

579
00:33:57,344 --> 00:34:01,423
somewhere in the middle or just
see this as of a tangent of your

580
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:01,953
journey?

581
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:06,949
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I would like
to have at one point a, a

582
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,128
traditional, like full-time
developer job, but I definitely

583
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,829
still want to keep writing. And
so if there's any way I can still

584
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:16,369
be involved, especially with
freeCodeCamp, it's still write

585
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,818
articles for them in some sort of
capacity. Cause I just, I, I love

586
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:26,244
to write it. I love. Teach people
and help out wherever I can. but

587
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:29,273
they think the bigger career goal
too, is I have all these ideas

588
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:34,043
for music related, uh, tech that
I want to build. And some of them

589
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:37,813
are crazy ideas. And I mean, I
guess all my ideas are crazy, but

590
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,083
Bekah: are my favorite.

591
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,753
Jessica: I guess That's the
entrepreneurship maybe where it's

592
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:45,003
like, oh, my ideas are insane,
but I just don't want to let them

593
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:45,443
go.

594
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:45,824
Dan: Those are

595
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:49,193
Jessica: the best ones And so.
Exactly. So, yeah, so that's like

596
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:52,943
the long-term goal is to start
slowly tackling some of these

597
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:57,623
ideas and just kind of go from
there and work a regular

598
00:34:57,623 --> 00:35:01,373
developer job, but then also keep
writing and have fun with it.

599
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:07,463
Bekah: Yeah, that gives me an
idea for a monthly challenge, I

600
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:11,994
think we have a big energy
channel in slack. And a lot of it

601
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:19,494
is just GIF's, um, to bring us
big energy. But I really think

602
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,434
that so many of us have these big
ideas that we think are

603
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,643
unattainable, or this is too big,
or this is too out there. Right.

604
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:31,494
Or there's just too many of them
like on one. if there was a big

605
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:34,943
idea month, right? Like we all
write down all of our big ideas

606
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:39,353
that we want to share. And work
together to kind of give feedback

607
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:42,384
on those big ideas and figure out
like where to focus or how to

608
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,713
break things down. And then, you
know, that way, like together, we

609
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,893
have that support, but we're,
we're making progress on the

610
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,143
things that we really enjoy doing
it.

611
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:55,304
Jessica: Exactly. I mean, I think
ideas are fun and playing around

612
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:58,184
with them and then trying to
implement them. And sometimes

613
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,103
people will call you crazy. I
mean, people thought I was nuts

614
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:03,764
to try to do a publishing
company. I remember I went to an

615
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:07,523
alumni event. And I was just
started with the business and I,

616
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:10,344
you know, you go around and does
events and you talk to small

617
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,954
groups of people, and it was some
sort of administrator with the

618
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:17,304
university of Rochester. And she
was asking me what my next plans

619
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:21,233
were. I said, well, you know, I
just moved here to LA and looking

620
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,353
for freelance work, but I also
have this sheet music business

621
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:28,204
that he just got started and she
was. Y I'm like, oh, okay. Well,

622
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:33,333
let me tell you why that was a
little taken aback. I was like,

623
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:37,563
okay, great. Well, this
conversation won't last long, uh,

624
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:40,324
so I had a few people. They're
just like, why would you, why

625
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:44,478
would you do that? But I just had
a very specific. Vision of what I

626
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,548
wanted with my sheet music
business. And then people were

627
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:49,278
surprised that it actually turned
into a business. I'm like, well,

628
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:52,639
yeah, I told her I was going to
do that. You didn't believe me.

629
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,748
And so, yeah, I think sometimes
people will just reject it and

630
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:00,168
then once they see it come true
and they're like, oh, okay. I see

631
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,778
it there. I mean, the same thing
happened with, with Disney where

632
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,688
people thought he was nuts to
build a park in Anaheim where all

633
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:09,418
these orange trees were and then.
Obviously that worked out for

634
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:12,809
him, but initially people thought
he was just completely nuts. Like

635
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,378
who's going to go to this park
and where is Anaheim and Well,

636
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,429
people were wrong then.

637
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,844
Bekah: Well, I love that
confidence that you talk It with

638
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,534
too. You're like, yeah, I'm going
to do this thing because I want

639
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,043
to do it. And it's a good idea.
And at some point, people start

640
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:32,003
to buy into that idea because of
how you present it and the

641
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:35,603
confidence that you use. And, oh,
you're just like, love how chill

642
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,664
you are when you talk about
things. I'm like, oh yeah, yeah.

643
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,824
I would definitely work with
Jessica on that, you know?

644
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:44,818
Jessica: I just like going for
things cause it's like, Yeah, it

645
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:47,588
either works out or it does it.
And if it doesn't work out, I

646
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,318
learned something. I had plenty
of things that didn't work out,

647
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:54,548
I'm glad I tried it. So I could
at least learn along the way, but

648
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,759
sometimes you just gotta go for
it. You can't really play safe

649
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,438
and, and um, you know what to do
too risky. You don't want to go

650
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:03,489
like bankrupt or anything crazy,
but like, you know, you just want

651
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,583
to. If you have an idea and you
feel really confident about it,

652
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,954
just, just go for it and take it
one step at a time. There.

653
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,748
Dan: Yeah, it's a theme. That's
come up a few times on the

654
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:16,889
podcast that, you know, it makes
me think of a Structured YOLO.

655
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:20,528
Uh, Nick Taylor, um, which is a
phrase he, he coined, you know,

656
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,619
but it's the same sort of idea,
right? It's is. You know, I mean,

657
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,998
don't want to do YOLO, right. But
the

658
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:28,614
Jessica: Exactly.

659
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,659
Dan: structured YOLO. Yeah,

660
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:30,563
Jessica: the way out there. I

661
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:30,918
Dan: yeah,

662
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:31,224
Jessica: my

663
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,139
Bekah: little bit of YOLO.

664
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:32,918
Dan: yeah,

665
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,213
Jessica: my business, I wasn't
like, okay, cool. Let's just

666
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,224
raise all this money. No, that
would have been crazy. Cause I

667
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:39,623
was like young, 20 something year
old had didn't know what they

668
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:42,653
were doing. Excited to take small
little steps to get there. I

669
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,673
couldn't go that big and do some
crazy fundraising goal or

670
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,284
whatever when I had no clue what
I was doing. So.

671
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,219
Dan: Absolutely. But the, know,
the willingness to have an idea

672
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:59,048
that is not what a normal, I
guess, whenever, you know, idea

673
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,028
that you might run into that
conversation with somebody like,

674
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,039
well, why, why are you doing
that? You know, but the

675
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,938
willingness to, um, jump into it,
you know, and, and push through,

676
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:11,588
I think is, uh, a, know, a
valuable, valuable trait to have,

677
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:13,498
you know, and obviously it's
served use or do.

678
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:22,224
Bekah: So sometimes, um, it can
be really challenging to write.

679
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:29,289
Blog posts to get started and to
receive feedback on blog posts.

680
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:33,239
You know, whether that's from an
editor or somebody who has

681
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:42,369
commented on your posts in a way
that is not, um, kind So how do

682
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,838
you navigate those challenging
situations while you're writing?

683
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:50,373
Jessica: Yeah, It's feedback is
always interesting, especially in

684
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:53,164
the world of the internet because
people can just hide behind their

685
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:56,043
computers and save virtually
anything to you that they

686
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,923
probably wouldn't say if you
guys, if you were face-to-face

687
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:02,824
with them, but I try to just
separate them between actual,

688
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:06,893
constructive feedback versus.
this is not helpful. I'm just

689
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,983
going to move on. And so I've
had, uh, some constructive

690
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:13,643
feedback, like, oh, this is
really good. could you like, uh,

691
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:17,213
you know, expand on this part or
could you talk more about this?

692
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,983
And I'm like, okay. Yeah, that
makes sense. And then there's

693
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,193
been times where it's like, well,
I think it would be better if you

694
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:25,014
went into this. I mean, that's
what real developers do or

695
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,983
whatever. So I've got like those
comments I'm like, okay, well

696
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:32,003
you're an obviously not helpful.
And so I just learned that, uh,

697
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:35,114
when I was running my business,
There's just those comments that,

698
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:38,923
that people just have to, you
know, just write things and

699
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,864
you're just like, okay, I'm just
not going to waste my energy on

700
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:46,003
that. It's a, luckily I haven't
had too many just absolutely

701
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,063
horrific things. Uh, at least
with my programming writing,

702
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,514
there was only one incident, um,
that I had when I was running my

703
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:55,934
sheet music company, where there
was this guy that went out of his

704
00:40:55,934 --> 00:41:01,054
way. To make accounts and post
race, racist memes and stuff on

705
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:04,324
my page and on my YouTube
channel. And I, of course I had

706
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,784
to block all that, but he would
keep creating new accounts of

707
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:10,653
like, you're that threatened what
I'm doing, that you have to spend

708
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:15,184
time. And so there are people out
there that just are that hateful

709
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:19,563
that you just exist because of
your race or your gender. And

710
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:22,474
it's just like, okay, you know,
it's a it's, it's okay to be

711
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:26,213
human. Yeah. Uh, you know, feel
that and go, well, come on. Yeah.

712
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:28,623
But at the end of the day, you
just have to remember like that's

713
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:32,454
their issue, right. They they're
just a hateful person. Is he just

714
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:36,893
trying to block them and move on?
Um, and, and just focus on the

715
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,253
helpful, constructive feedback as
well as the positive feedback to,

716
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:42,623
to know that you're on the right
track, you're doing the right

717
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:42,744
thing.

718
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:47,664
Bekah: Yeah, I really liked that.
And that's for a long time, I

719
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:52,134
stayed away from blogging on any
platform except my own blog,

720
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,929
because I didn't have comments
enabled. I couldn't see how many

721
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,918
people liked it, And I still
frequently think about going back

722
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:04,898
to that rather than cross posting
other places that, that have

723
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,469
those built-in things, because
sometimes it can just, it can be

724
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:12,969
hard or you put a lot of time and
effort into something maybe two

725
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:17,119
people like it versus the thing
that I, I YOLO'd on a Saturday

726
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:20,378
night. And then there's all of
these hits and like, what, what

727
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:21,248
is this.

728
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,998
Jessica: Yeah. I I've been there
so many times both with like

729
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:28,179
writing technical articles then
with sheet music where I'll

730
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,239
release a new product I'll be
like, oh, this is good. Totally

731
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:34,293
sell through. This is gonna be a
hit. And then. The sales are like

732
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:38,134
nothing. I'm like, okay, wildly
misjudge that. And then I'll

733
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:40,773
release another product then
like, okay, this will do okay.

734
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,963
And then it ends up being a
breakout. I'm like, what

735
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:47,193
happened? What did I misjudged?
That it's the same thing with

736
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:49,594
writing where there'll be some
articles. Actually, this just

737
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:53,253
happened with the CodePen and
Replit articles, because I

738
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:56,554
decided to write those because
free cookie up uses both of those

739
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,998
tools, um, in their
certifications. There really

740
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:04,048
should be a guide to help them
since it's based on the course.

741
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,748
And I just thought, okay, well,
few people write these. Hopefully

742
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:09,449
they'll just refer to them. But
then both of them were retweeted

743
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:13,829
by the co-founders and the CEO.
And I'm like, okay, that was

744
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,659
unexpected, but that's kind of
cool.

745
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:21,608
Dan: Do you ever um, like doing
tech support comments, you know,

746
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:24,409
sections when you're writing
technical articles,

747
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,568
Jessica: I do. Yeah. Yeah.
Sometimes someone's like, oh, I

748
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:31,259
tried this example from your
article. It's not working. And

749
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:33,358
I'm like, oh, could you write the
code? It's sometimes it's hard.

750
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,329
Cause like Twitter and stuff,
it's not really good for writing

751
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:38,309
code, but I'm like, I don't know,
just try your best or take a

752
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,429
picture or something. then I'll
say, oh, you have this syntax

753
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,739
error right here. If you clean
that up, that you should be good

754
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,829
to go. It's a. Sometimes just
kind of, uh, or actually this

755
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,679
just happened to, with, uh, the
NodeMailer article where they're

756
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,588
like, oh, could you put this up
on, GitHub repos so we could

757
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,688
study it? And I was like, oh
yeah, I should totally do that.

758
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:59,858
Cause I had just posted the final
code in the article. and without

759
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:03,548
thinking, like people would want
to study it and uh, you know,

760
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,068
fork it and all this fun stuff. I
was like, oh yeah, we should

761
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:10,088
probably do that. So I created a
GitHub repository and then, uh,

762
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,768
just shared it with that. But
sometimes I'll kind of

763
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:16,268
troubleshoot with them as best as
possible. My questions are vague.

764
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:19,719
I'm like, I'm not really sure
what you're working with unless

765
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:22,838
we like together on some sort of
zoom meet, but I don't know how

766
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,369
feasible that is, but

767
00:44:26,273 --> 00:44:27,833
Bekah: yeah. that doesn't scale.
Well, I think.

768
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,518
Dan: Uh, what about, so you
mentioned like code stuff like

769
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:38,409
that. kind of, um, I dunno
process, or I guess I'm looking

770
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:43,313
for advice generally. if, you if
if your, uh,article Involves a

771
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,634
lot of code and stuff like that.
Do you try to, um, like things up

772
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:51,204
into little bits or make a link
to Like, you know, like you

773
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:53,574
mentioned, uh, what, what kind
of, of approaches do you take

774
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:56,213
with, uh, w with technical
articles and with

775
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:00,143
Jessica: Yeah. So for some of the
examples they're really small,

776
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:04,494
like I just wrote one about, um,
JavaScript contains or includes

777
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,704
method. Um, and so those were
like really, really small, um,

778
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:11,063
uh, code examples in there. But
then one of my other articles was

779
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:16,074
on the MVC pattern. And so I kind
of had to struggle with how much

780
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:18,864
code am I going to include in
this? Cause I built an app

781
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:22,518
specifically to talk about that
pattern. But I thought, okay, is

782
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:25,969
this going to be a full
walkthrough tutorial, or am I

783
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:29,449
just going to give out chunks of
it? So it ended up working where

784
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:33,384
I said, okay, it's fine. If they
do. Work with that particular

785
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:35,543
stack that I was working with and
I was working with the burn

786
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:38,664
stack, but if I could just talk
about the concepts and just have

787
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:41,873
a few snippets of code and say,
this is what this code does. Even

788
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,994
if you're not a JavaScript
developer, at least they can,

789
00:45:45,023 --> 00:45:48,384
there's some context. And I had
the final, project there that

790
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:51,503
they could look at and say, oh,
okay, that's what she's doing

791
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:54,173
here. And so sometimes you'll you
just want to have like these

792
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:56,364
small little code examples
sometimes it's totally fine to

793
00:45:56,364 --> 00:46:00,974
just link to a repository if it's
super super long. cause then

794
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:04,034
there's that battle between
length and it's like, how much

795
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:08,173
are people really gonna read? If
it's super, super long, there's

796
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:11,264
not too many, really long
articles on freeCodeCamp. There's

797
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:14,474
a few that are like at 7,000 plus
words. I personally haven't

798
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:20,188
written any of those. but I think
my longest is 20 I think my

799
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:23,489
longest was 3000, but that ended
up just listing off all the types

800
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:28,079
of like free courses you could
take. but, uh, yeah, I try to hit

801
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,789
that magic mark of like 1500, a
thousand words or less. I mean,

802
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,009
if there's only so much, you
could write about some of these

803
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:38,849
methods where it's like, I can't
write 1500 words on the includes

804
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,248
method for JavaScript. There's
only so much you could do there

805
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:42,449
that.

806
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:46,253
Dan: Oh, a good note. I mean, and
that's also an interesting thing

807
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:52,539
to like of, you know, um,
writing, you. If you could feel

808
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,329
yourself getting like too long,
you know, it, do you try to cut

809
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,289
down or do you about splitting it
up, but, you I suppose it depends

810
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:03,668
on what platform you're on or
Code Camp or not, or, you know,

811
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:05,268
but generally

812
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:05,728
Jessica: right. Cause

813
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:06,159
Dan: you know,

814
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:11,563
Jessica: I just joined dev.to,
week ago and, or I think I joined

815
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:16,184
a while for Nick's VS Code tips,
and then just hadn't used it for

816
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:19,643
awhile then, like rejoined, I
guess. uh, for the NodeMailer

817
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:22,833
article, I was like, oh, Well, I
have these ideas about how to

818
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:26,943
style the emails and how to, uh,
actually, uh, you know, deploy it

819
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:29,193
to Heroku. But maybe we could
just break that up. That could be

820
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:32,673
a separate article. And I like
how in-depth too, you can link to

821
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:35,014
like, create your own little
series and it will link all the

822
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,224
articles together. so sometimes
when you're writing something,

823
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:41,284
you're like, huh, I have these
other ideas. Maybe it could be

824
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:44,494
like, this is part one. And then
this is part two and stick around

825
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,253
for part three or something.
think that's totally fine. Just

826
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,164
so it doesn't become this monster
article. It's like, ah,

827
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,349
Everybody. It's the same thing
with videos. I think some of the

828
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:58,099
videos are super long and some of
these channels

829
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:58,344
Dan: Yeah.

830
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,438
Jessica: where like, if
somebody's going to sit through

831
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:03,679
17 hours or is that one of those
things where you just got to

832
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,119
break it up into smaller bite
size videos. but I guess

833
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,518
everybody has their own learning
methods. So maybe there are

834
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:15,318
people that will go through a 17
hour video or, you know, 7,000.

835
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:17,594
Bekah: My husband used to
livestream for freeCodeCamp. And

836
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:21,673
sometimes he would do it for
hours and people would stay the

837
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:22,233
whole time.

838
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:24,748
Jessica: Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's
some like, yeah. I'm just like,

839
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,099
wow, how

840
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,028
Bekah: I just live stream for an
hour for the first time ever,

841
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:35,998
probably by myself. I was tired
of hearing myself talk, like, I

842
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,159
can't imagine how everybody else
was feeling. You

843
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:38,789
Jessica: right.

844
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:44,199
Bekah: my attention span to die.
And then I, then I start YOLOing

845
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:47,849
things and it's, it's not, not
the place I want to be

846
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,384
Jessica: Right. Right. You know,
actually that reminds me, Danny

847
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:53,954
Thompson is one where he has
these really long Twitter spaces,

848
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:57,134
but they're really good. So
that's why he kind of is able to

849
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,889
get away with it because for most
people. They would kind of die

850
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:05,389
off after like at 45 minutes or
an hour, sometimes he'll go for

851
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:08,148
like three hours or longer. And
then there's still like hundreds

852
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:12,079
of people and I'm just like, wow,
that's kudos to him then.

853
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,889
Bekah: I feel like you need voice
training for some or something,

854
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:19,378
you know, like even talking, even
when I used to teach night

855
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:24,208
classes, like three hours of
having conversation and by the

856
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:30,324
end, My throat hurts, you know,
and like I am done, I, I did know

857
00:49:30,324 --> 00:49:35,773
a teacher who was taking classes
for that reason, because they

858
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:38,213
were saying, it's, it's how
you're using your voice and you

859
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,793
have to do it in this different
way. And then you'll be fine. And

860
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:47,949
exercise your muscle. Like, ah, I
know that's a lot. I mean, I

861
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:50,619
think it's the same thing for
writing too. It's it's a muscle

862
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,679
that you have to exercise. So I
imagine, I mean, you're writing

863
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,518
on a lot of new topics all the
time and learning things, but has

864
00:49:57,518 --> 00:49:59,498
the writing process gotten
easier?

865
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,543
Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I now have
more of like a game plan on how

866
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,574
I'm going to enter into an
article. And so I usually like to

867
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:09,213
start off with just a little
introductory paragraph, knowing

868
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:11,914
I'm probably going to edit it
later on, but I just throw

869
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:15,003
something up and then I get into
the meat of the article and kind

870
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:19,023
of flesh it out. Um, and then
once I clean up the actual main

871
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:21,994
part, then I can go through and
come up with a really good

872
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:25,384
introductory paragraph and a
conclusion there I try to focus

873
00:50:25,384 --> 00:50:29,824
all my intention, uh, you know,
just writing the main parts. And

874
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:33,139
sometimes I just do like a free
write. Throw words on the page

875
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:37,039
and of them make it some of them,
I cut out sections. I'm like, I

876
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,458
don't know what this was. I mean,
that just happened with the

877
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:43,878
article a few weeks ago on how to
create tables and SQL. And some

878
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,208
of those sections of like, why
this doesn't make any sense. I

879
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:50,688
don't know why this, I thought
this was relevant, but I was just

880
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:53,028
throwing words on the page. I'm
like, oh, I should talk about

881
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:56,873
this. And then I read it back.
No, I shouldn't have talked about

882
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:59,784
that, but that's an easier? for
us to kind of cut things out

883
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,844
there and then just reshape it
into something acceptable that I

884
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:05,693
could send to the editor. she
doesn't have to look at it and

885
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:06,773
go, what is this?

886
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:10,864
Dan: There's one of the benefits
of the medium, right? Is do you

887
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:14,733
have the, it easier to go back
and things out that don't make

888
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:14,974
sense,

889
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,324
Jessica: Exactly. Yeah.

890
00:51:16,384 --> 00:51:20,494
Dan: as opposed to maybe a live
streamer, something things to get

891
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:20,914
out there?

892
00:51:20,983 --> 00:51:23,143
Bekah: the expectation of live
streaming, so

893
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:23,914
Dan: for sure.

894
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:33,626
Bekah: acceptable thing. Um, I
can't remember what to say. Oh, I

895
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:39,452
know what I was gonna say. Um,
Rough drafts are so important. I,

896
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:43,831
and I think that it's worth it to
point out that there's a process

897
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:46,081
that you get better at that
process. And you have a rough

898
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:50,132
draft. No, nobody puts out a
perfect rough draft, a perfect

899
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:54,141
draft. The first time it is a
process and it does take time.

900
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:59,206
You know, just listening to you
talk about tech, Jessica, you

901
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:04,967
communicate it so well. it's
really, I feel like I learned a

902
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,757
lot just hearing you talk about
these things. And so you can

903
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,286
really appreciate that process of
learning and then, and how it

904
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:16,916
impacts the way that you talk
about things. And I imagine it,

905
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:21,047
that goes into interviewing and
stuff like that. Because you talk

906
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:24,547
with credibility, then people are
more likely to. Um, see you as a

907
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:25,536
credible person.

908
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:29,297
Jessica: Yeah, Yeah. And that's
the thing is that want to come

909
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:33,077
across as, how can I add value to
the company or organization if

910
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:36,166
you come across as I just really
need a job? Well, the company's

911
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,927
not really hiring you because you
need a job. Like they're hiring

912
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,527
you because they need people to
join their team and add value. if

913
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,376
you come in and say, here's how I
can add value to you, then

914
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:48,347
they'll listen. And I think
that's just coming in with a

915
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:51,291
little bit of confidence. Will go
a long way there.

916
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:57,016
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. So we're
at about time here, but are there

917
00:52:57,016 --> 00:53:02,297
any last tips that you have for
our listeners about getting,

918
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:04,007
started with writing?

919
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:09,737
Jessica: Um, I think just the
best tip is just, get started. I

920
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:12,106
think a lot of people
procrastinate because they're

921
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,907
like, I don't know what to write
about. I don't know what to do. I

922
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,416
don't know how to get started.
get started and just start

923
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,936
working from there. And you can

started writing? to just start

927
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,121
writing, to start throwing some
words on the page, start creating

928
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:37,961

and edit it down from there.
