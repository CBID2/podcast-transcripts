00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,540
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season one, episode three of

2
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,340
the virtual coffee podcast.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,210
I am Bekah and this is a podcast
that features members of the

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,290
virtual coffee community.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,860
Virtual coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,540
stages of their coding journey.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,420
And they're here on this
podcast, sharing their stories

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,440
and what they've learned.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,370
And we are here to share it with
you here with me.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,500
Today is my co-host Dan.

11
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,224
Dan: In this episode, Tori
Crawford joins us to talk

12
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:47,324
about her journey through the
interview process that

13
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:52,214
included about 53 interviews,
430 applications in a pandemic

14
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:55,035
offer that ultimately led to her
being ghosted by the company.

15
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,334
She gives her tips and tricks,
including recognizing that

16
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:01,664
interviews are a two-way street
and her hope for industry.

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,130
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,990
Like we start every virtual
coffee.

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,180
We introduce ourselves with our
name, where we're

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,750
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

21
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:15,119
Today's question is what is one
interesting

22
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,919
thing about yourself?

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,720
We hope you enjoy this episode.

24
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,180
Hey, I'm Bekah.

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,270
I am from a small town in Ohio.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,830
I'm a front end developer.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,040
And one interesting thing about
me is that my first pet was

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,700
a hamster and I named it star
scraper to the highest moon.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,140
Dan: Star scraper.

30
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,990
Hi, I'm Dan.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,869
I am a front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio, and

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,780
an interesting fact about me is
that I play disc golf.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,470
Tori: Hi, I'm Tori I'm from San
Jose, California.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,850
I am currently a back end
engineer specializing

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,769
in Ruby on rails and interesting
a fact about me.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,370
Would have to be that I
hopefully plan to retire

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,870
in Ireland, someday.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,270
So on site.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,320
nice.

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,640
Very, very cool.

41
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:27,725
Bekah: Yeah.

42
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,895
Um, thanks for being here with
us, Tori.

43
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,985
We are very, very excited to be
talking to today.

44
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,815
A little background about Tori.

45
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,545
She is a software engineer, a
blogger, and

46
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,015
a mental health advocate.

47
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:42,645
She graduated from the flat iron
school software engineering

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,105
program in February of 2019.

49
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:50,425
After 14 months and over 15
interviews landed her first

50
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:54,535
role as a backend engineer in
June of 2020 since landing her

51
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:58,345
first role, she's gotten married
and is now an expecting mother

52
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,885
with the aspiration of becoming
a site reliability engineer.

53
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:06,895
Also like to, um, say that Tori
is a Steelers fan and she knows

54
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,635
the value of square pizza.

55
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:09,385
And that's very,

56
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:10,905
Tori: very important to me.

57
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,510
Very important.

58
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,040
Ohio valley pizza is the best
pizza  that's right.

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,700
I,

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,740
Bekah: um, very much had some
this weekend.

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,620
So if you have not had that,
Google it, you are missing out.

62
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,600
And I am sorry for everyone who
does not

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,590
live in the Ohio valley.

64
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,410
Tori: Um,

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,380
Bekah: all right, Dan, you're
missing out.

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,552
It's mm-hmm  it's.

67
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,839
Uh, so Tori, I just love to get
started with origin stories

68
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,049
and I know our paths have
overlapped in a lot of ways.

69
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,769
We both went to flat iron, Ohio
valley connections,

70
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,299
Steelers fans, um, software
engineers, moms.

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,570
Um, but I wanna get more details
about your story.

72
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,760
So can you tell us how you got

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,929
Tori: into software engineering?

74
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,399
Yeah.

75
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:03,120
So, um, We'll go back a little
bit further.

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,590
I guess I am a career changer.

77
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,880
Um, I did go to flat iron
school, um, as a bootcamp

78
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,180
and, uh, previously I was an
athletic trainer.

79
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,210
Um, I went to school for five
years.

80
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:18,060
I got two bachelor's degrees and
a master's degree.

81
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,720
Um, and.

82
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,955
Yeah, I worked for an east coast
hockey league team called the

83
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,595
Wichita thunder for a season.

84
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,485
And it was a lot of fun.

85
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:32,475
Um, but I was working like a
hundred hours a week and

86
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,165
it was an insane schedule to
keep traveling constantly.

87
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:39,015
I kind of learned that that
isn't really what I

88
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:43,470
wanted and, um, Yeah, it was
like a hard wake up call.

89
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,160
And I had to like reevaluate
things and discovered that I

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,380
didn't really have the same
passion for athletic training.

91
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,760
If it wasn't sitting on the
bench on beside ice, watching

92
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,400
hockey players dodging pucks
sticks, you know?

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,150
Um, so yeah, I.

94
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,315
Reevaluated, everything kind of
decided what I

95
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,875
wanted to move into next.

96
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:10,815
My now husband is a data
engineer and he suggested,

97
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,485
because he knew how creative I
liked being possibly looking

98
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,685
into front end engineering.

99
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,015
And I learned HTML and CSS
started to learn.

100
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:21,575
JavaScript felt like I couldn't
wrap my head around it at all.

101
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,469
So , I tried to look for some
structure, which landed

102
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,390
me at flat iron school.

103
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,060
And, um, it was there that I
fell in love with Ruby and.

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,140
Decided to completely pivot to
back end and yeah, it just  fell

105
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,750
right into that, that fun spiral
of then not really liking front

106
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,870
end and despising JavaScript.

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,480
Um, but you know, it's okay.

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,050
Got through it.

109
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,670
And I still, to this day, work
with our front front

110
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,640
end engineers at my company to
like, keep those skills.

111
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:00,275
Kind of like brushed up on
because I struggled

112
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,114
learning them so much.

113
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,104
I'm not gonna lose them.

114
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,234
So , yeah.

115
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:05,825
Bekah: I love that.

116
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:08,135
That's just a really great
attitude to have.

117
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,984
Um, I also love that you are a
collector of degrees.

118
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:12,275
Tori: yep.

119
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,390
Um, lots of school

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,100
Bekah: and also you've been
coming to virtual coffee since

121
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,390
almost the very beginning.

122
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,240
I think the first tweet that I
sent out in the beginning

123
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,190
of April, um, you responded to,
and I don't think maybe

124
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:32,220
you made that one, but you made
the second one and

125
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,270
you've been here for a while.

126
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,600
So I'd love to know a little bit
more about like how you

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,100
came to find virtual coffee.

128
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,300
Tori: Yeah.

129
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,615
Um, Obviously like through
bootcamp, you and I

130
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,775
had communicated a few times and
I was already

131
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,555
following you on Twitter.

132
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:51,195
And, um, I feel like with the
pandemic and everything,

133
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,045
obviously the need for community
was there.

134
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:57,015
And before the pandemic, I
really tried to go out

135
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,425
and do a lot of meetups.

136
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,365
And like I was driving an hour
up to San Francisco to do a

137
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:04,395
few different meetups up there,
like a month, like once a month.

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,805
And, um, when the pandemic hit,
I kind of lost that.

139
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:12,540
Um, And when you mentioned doing
the virtual coffee

140
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,980
stuff, I was like, oh my.

141
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,690
This sounds amazing.

142
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,070
Um, I was super excited and then
of course I, I was in California

143
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,620
and you're on the east coast and
you're like, yeah, it's gonna

144
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,690
be at 9 AM Eastern time.

145
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,730
And I was like, I am not waking
up at 6 AM.

146
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,470
so I was really happy that the
next time you move, like

147
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,710
the Thursday, I think it was a
Thursday meeting the next time.

148
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,520
Um, Was at noon.

149
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,470
And I was like, oh, that's
totally doable.

150
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,860
Um, so I started going to those,
but yeah, it was just

151
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,620
that need for community.

152
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,610
And also like, while I enjoyed
going to in person, um, events,

153
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,700
it did suck having to drive all
the way up to San Francisco.

154
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,020
Whenever I wanted to do one.

155
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,400
Um, while there were some in the
south bay, they just

156
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,770
were more along the lines of.

157
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:08,145
Super educational, like
technical interviewing, um,

158
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:12,795
prep, which like I went to
those, but the fun ones,  where

159
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,955
they would do like karaoke and
like really like have

160
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:18,375
like happy hour type things were
up in San Francisco.

161
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,075
And I enjoyed those felt a
little bit more lax for me.

162
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:26,280
Um, So definitely it was nice to
be like, okay,

163
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,770
well this, I won't have to drive
an hour to get to.

164
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,260
And then an hour back at like
nine o'clock at night

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,690
and  so yeah, it was, it was a
good, a good little

166
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,220
like, yeah, I wanna do this.

167
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,050
It's gonna be great doing
something virtual.

168
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,190
Um, and then, you know, pandemic
is still going

169
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,520
months later and we can't do
anything in person yet.

170
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,970
So this has become the new
normal and yeah.

171
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:55,815
It's great to have found my
community that I really like,

172
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:59,805
and I feel very accepted in, so,
and I can be myself.

173
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:00,525
It's amazing.

174
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,670
Yeah.

175
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,000
Bekah: Yeah.

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,690
It's been great having you here
and, you know, I so much

177
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,320
admire your vulnerability and
how much you've been able

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,530
to share with the community,
because, you know, just to have

179
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,840
that, like closeness allows for
such a stronger, a stronger

180
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,660
community, when you can talk
about things like that, the

181
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,890
challenges that you're facing.

182
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,880
So it's been

183
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Tori: great having you here.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,280
Yeah.

185
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,240
It's been really nice.

186
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,260
Being able to be open and
vulnerable with a.

187
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,185
100%.

188
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:37,215
Like, I really feel like I can
come to the group with a lot of

189
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:41,385
different problems that I face
and someone's gonna be there to

190
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:45,525
tell me that it's gonna be okay
or like help give me advice.

191
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:50,595
Um, so it's, or just like say
that they relate and

192
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:56,385
like we can discuss our feelings
together and I.

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
So unique and I really love it.

194
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,370
Bekah: Yeah.

195
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,850
I, I also love that very much
about the community.

196
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,840
And I think that, you know,
being able to share these

197
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,680
things also, you know, you don't
feel alone in circumstances

198
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,970
where you might feel alone.

199
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,800
Um, mm-hmm

200
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,520
Tori: that's

201
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,190
so

202
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:20,970
Bekah: you.

203
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:25,155
Are maybe a prolific interviewer

204
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:28,185
Tori: um,

205
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,055
Bekah: I think probably not by
choice and I just am

206
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:35,385
was like, remember being so
surprised at all the stuff

207
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,535
that you had to go through as
you were interviewing.

208
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:41,234
So can you just talk through
that journey a little bit?

209
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:41,844
Tori: Yeah.

210
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:43,454
yeah.

211
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:47,324
Um,  interviewing was.

212
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,245
Crazy for me.

213
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:53,865
Um, when I first graduated from
flat iron school, I

214
00:10:53,865 --> 00:11:01,635
took about a month and a half
off from when I graduated to

215
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:02,895
when I started my job search.

216
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,475
Um, so I started my job search.

217
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,345
Late March or early April of
2019.

218
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:13,515
Um, and it went until June of
2020.

219
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:18,855
And, uh, I think I went through,
I have a blog post

220
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:22,964
on all of my stats and I think I
went through 53 interviews.

221
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,515
Um, it was crazy.

222
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:28,245
I was talking to my husband last
night and he was like, you know,

223
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:31,995
like most people go through
like, 10 in their lifetime or

224
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,574
they like go through like a
handful in their lifetime and

225
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:39,015
you went through so many and I'm
like, yeah, it was like

226
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,854
quite a struggle at times.

227
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:47,295
Um, I was getting through a lot
of first round interviews

228
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:48,615
getting through a lot of them.

229
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:50,104
Um, I don't.

230
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,635
Think that I have a real issue.

231
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,275
Personality wise that like has
red flags that like

232
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,825
recruiters are like, Nope, we're
not letting them go past.

233
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,944
Um, so like that's nice.

234
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,735
Um, I got really good at doing
those interviews,

235
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:07,694
but technical interviews were
the tough part for me.

236
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:17,295
Um, definitely just like nerve
wracking at the beginning.

237
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,045
I.

238
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,870
At some points, like, honestly,
like I cried

239
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,060
before the interview, I was
like, so stressed out and

240
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,520
nervous and just like, felt so
down on myself, like, I'm

241
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,600
not gonna be good at this.

242
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,170
Like, this is like, it's so much
pressure to like

243
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,030
one have a time limit.

244
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,500
Two have like one to who knows
how many other people sitting

245
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,209
there, like watching you code?

246
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,209
Um, I was still.

247
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,360
Not confident in speaking out
loud while coding, like I

248
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,770
could do it, but I still like to
this day, I still feel like

249
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,310
I'm not the most technical
speaker when I'm talking, when

250
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:57,180
I'm going through my code.

251
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,980
Like, I feel like I don't say.

252
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,915
Technically right thing all the
time.

253
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:04,944
Um, and a few of my coworkers
always ensure me now.

254
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:08,334
They're like, no, this is gonna
come with months of experience.

255
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,165
Like, you're gonna get the hang
of it eventually.

256
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:12,234
Um, this isn't something that
you have to know right now, but

257
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:15,025
like, you feel that pressure
when you're in interview.

258
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:20,755
Um, so those, those were where I
was failing at first.

259
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,025
I like would not make it past
technical interviews.

260
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:30,270
Um, Eventually, I like really
worked on one.

261
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,110
I was getting so many technical
interviews that I was getting a

262
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,610
little less nervous about them.

263
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,410
I was feeling more comfortable
in myself.

264
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,360
I was feeling more comfortable
speaking out loud.

265
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:48,765
I was just like getting used to
the process and, um, Things

266
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:49,785
got a little bit easier.

267
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:53,535
I felt more lax and you know, it
was, I was getting

268
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,314
past them a little bit more and
eventually I started

269
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,275
making it to final rounds and,
you know, got ghosted a

270
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,545
few times and , you know, it
happened way more often than

271
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,895
I would have expected it to.

272
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:13,724
I got ghosted by a company who
offered me a job.

273
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,155
Mm-hmm  so.

274
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,475
That was fun.

275
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:26,535
it was a crazy process going
through, um, it

276
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,555
was a rollercoaster ride.

277
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:28,245
Yeah.

278
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:32,955
And I'm I'm, it was all worth it
in the end.

279
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,095
I love where I work now.

280
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,325
I love the people I work with.

281
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:41,625
So, you know, everything I went
through was completely worth

282
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,065
what I'm getting to do now.

283
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:48,195
Dan: Did you find yourself like
having to, um, with

284
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,095
the technical interviews?

285
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,765
I mean, having all that practice
makes sense that you would be

286
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,695
more comfortable near the end of
the process, but, um, as

287
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,075
far as like, actually learn,
like trying to, I don't get

288
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:01,785
better at the technical part or
anything, like, did you

289
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,695
find yourself like trying to
study or, or do more things

290
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,735
or learn more things when you
were in that, you know, stage.

291
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,530
Tori: Yeah, I definitely did.

292
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,540
Um, I actually started taking, I
realized that the questions

293
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:19,710
that were really getting me
stumped and whatnot was like,

294
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,440
I would be able to write out the
solution, but it

295
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,420
wouldn't be super efficient.

296
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,080
And like, I would be asked the
question, like, how

297
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,210
would you make this better?

298
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,330
Like, how would you decrease
the, the time

299
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,710
that it takes to complete.

300
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,135
This algorithm or whatever.

301
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:40,944
And, um, I, I wasn't able to
answer it.

302
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:43,795
Like I like big O time
complexity.

303
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,454
Like I, I had no idea.

304
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:48,775
I wasn't taught that in
bootcamp.

305
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:51,025
Um, I didn't do a good job at
going out and

306
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:53,785
trying to teach myself it either
at the beginning.

307
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,855
Um, I realized that that, that
was kind of my weakness.

308
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,415
It was happening over and over
again.

309
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,245
And, you know, eventually you
have to look at yourself

310
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,105
and be like, okay, well, you
need to learn this.

311
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,715
You keep ask, getting asked
these types of questions.

312
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:09,465
Um, you're not going, gonna get
past these types of

313
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,595
interviews if you don't learn.

314
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,365
Um, so I.

315
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,594
Um, bought a U Demi course.

316
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:18,765
I don't know if that's how you
say it.

317
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:24,194
U Demi, you D me . I bought a
course on data

318
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,905
structures and algorithms.

319
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:29,115
Um, it was like mastering the
coding interview

320
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,625
and I went through.

321
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,825
The whole data structures,
section and big O section.

322
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:41,415
And I learned so much and I was
like, oh my gosh, this

323
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,455
all makes so much more sense.

324
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:47,475
Like, this is why I should be
writing my code this way.

325
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,305
It's so much more efficient.

326
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:54,345
And like, oh, if I like assign
in a ver a variable here,

327
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:56,145
like that takes up more space.

328
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,205
And I  like I had no.

329
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,189
Idea of any of those things.

330
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,589
When I first started
interviewing and I went

331
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,020
through this course and like, I
really felt like things

332
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,160
were starting to click for me.

333
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,670
And I started to get a lot
better at interviewing

334
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,500
being able to answer questions,
feeling a lot

335
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,639
more comfortable speaking.

336
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,800
And, um, it was just, I don't
know, it was like

337
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,379
a whole different like
confidence booster that I

338
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,270
was like, this is great.

339
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,450
Um, I just.

340
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,825
I don't know, I feel like I kind
of like blossomed and took off

341
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:33,585
at that point that I was able to
like, learn those small things.

342
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:37,425
And I was starting to get past
those interviews and

343
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:40,935
I was like, okay, this was
totally worth the money

344
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,135
that I paid for this course.

345
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:45,075
And I've like really starting to
see progress.

346
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,645
Um, and.

347
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,805
I finally got an offer and then
the pandemic hit.

348
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:53,175
And then I got ghosted by the
company that offered me

349
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:59,235
the job and , um, and like a
little bit of a confidence,

350
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:02,925
ER, at that point, cause it was
like interviews basically

351
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,515
stopped for a month or two.

352
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,935
And I was like, man, I just hit
my stride.

353
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:08,355
Yeah.

354
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,385
I, I had just hit my stride and
like really felt like

355
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:13,215
things were going well.

356
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,105
Um, And kind of got halted, but
then things started

357
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,895
picking back up again, started
interviewing what the company

358
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:20,915
that I'm working with now.

359
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,945
And it was . It was great.

360
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:27,245
And you know, the company that I
work for now, didn't give me

361
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:29,135
some crazy technical interview.

362
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,235
Like a lot of other companies
did.

363
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,805
Um, I got to walk through an old
project that I created

364
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:35,825
for a different company.

365
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:39,635
Uh  when I interviewed through
them, something that I was proud

366
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,254
of, but I didn't make it past.

367
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,015
That interview process.

368
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:46,105
Um, but I was proud of the
project that I built.

369
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:50,395
I got to walk through it with,
um, my director

370
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,475
of engineering now.

371
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:56,545
And, uh, , it was, it was a
great thing of like him

372
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:58,435
just like asking me a bunch of
questions, why I built

373
00:18:58,435 --> 00:18:59,485
it the way that I did.

374
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:02,785
And, um, the thought process
that went into.

375
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:09,345
Like why I chose to use
technology XYZ and like all

376
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:14,325
of these, like more thoughtful
technical questions, um, that

377
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:18,645
weren't like solve this crazy
algorithm because you're

378
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:19,814
totally gonna use this and

379
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:20,534
Dan: work.

380
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,754
Right.

381
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:23,745
Was he, wasn't just trying to
stump you or whatever.

382
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:24,885
Tori: Yeah.

383
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,455
Bekah: I also think that's a
really good indication of

384
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,985
the type of workplace too.

385
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,530
Um, you just covered so much
stuff, uh, that I

386
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,500
wanna talk about, but I wanna
back up for a second.

387
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:42,210
Um, so I was talking to some
people this weekend and one

388
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,129
of the things I said is, um,
when you hear somebody

389
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,699
say no so many times.

390
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,430
There's I think so many times
you can hear it before you

391
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,420
start to believe it yourself.

392
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,750
Right.

393
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,140
And I think that we see that
happening with a lot of

394
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,090
people who are interviewing for
jobs and getting

395
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,800
those repeat rejections.

396
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,670
And I'm, I am curious like how
you dealt with

397
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,350
that because that's a lot.

398
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:10,740
And I think, you know, that just
says a lot about

399
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,200
you, that you were able to keep
working through

400
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,300
that, but how were you able

401
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,840
Tori: to keep working?

402
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,090
Yeah.

403
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,950
It's oh man, it's crazy.

404
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,460
Um, it it's tough.

405
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,840
I honestly, at the beginning I
had a really hard time with it.

406
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,610
Um, I think one lesson that I
had to learn through

407
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,760
the process of getting rejected
so many times was.

408
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,160
It's not personal.

409
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,970
Um, as much as it's like, yeah,
they're rejecting you.

410
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,900
They're denying you.

411
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,120
Um, you're not a good fit.

412
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,260
It's like, okay.

413
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,760
But you may not be the best fit
right now for that company

414
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,610
that doesn't always necessarily
mean that you won't always be

415
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:57,620
a good fit for that company.

416
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,670
Um, your skills may not be where
they need to

417
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,690
be at that point for the role
that you applied to.

418
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,690
That's that's okay.

419
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,030
It's it's not, it's not
personal.

420
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,610
It's, they're looking for
specific things.

421
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,570
You're not really meeting those
criteria and that's, it's okay.

422
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,750
You're not gonna meet the needs
of every company.

423
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:29,130
You're not gonna, I hate using
this cultural fit thing, but

424
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,560
like, you're not gonna fit the
culture of every company.

425
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,880
You're not it.

426
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,980
You just, you can't take it
personally.

427
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,830
Like you really have to detach
and it.

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,710
At first, like, I, I cried a lot
at the rejections.

429
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,480
Um,  I struggle.

430
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,950
I mean, I'm, I'm open about
this.

431
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,210
I, I struggle with depression.

432
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,230
I struggle with anxiety.

433
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,740
This is like, that was something
that like, I ended up going to

434
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:58,680
therapy, like at the beginning
of my job search because I was

435
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,920
having a hard time handling the
rejection thing and it was like

436
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,240
really making my depression bad.

437
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,690
And, you know, you just, you
have to learn to,

438
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,620
to kind of detach from it,
realize that it's.

439
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,675
Personal attack.

440
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:19,545
It's not anything really
against, against you and you

441
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:23,865
kind of just, you, you have to
like take a moment and reflect

442
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:31,005
and be like, okay, well, why
could they have rejected me?

443
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:34,425
And, and like, in a way of like
being detached, like

444
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:37,965
think, okay, was I missing some
certain skills that they

445
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:39,675
were definitely asking for?

446
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:45,660
Um,  and that kind of gives you
a moment to like, reflect and

447
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,680
be like, okay, well, I didn't
have skill X, Y, Z, or sometimes

448
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,130
like, I even had to like think
through the interview that I

449
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,750
had with the person and be like,
okay, was there something, was

450
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,390
there something that I wouldn't
have liked about the company?

451
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,750
Did they ask me weird questions
that like, I, that would like

452
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,850
raise a little flag in my head.

453
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,040
At that point too.

454
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,510
Like, I definitely had a lot of
those.

455
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,780
I pulled out of interview
processes with companies because

456
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,370
like I was feeling red flags.

457
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,600
Um, and you have to realize that
the interview

458
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,070
process goes both ways.

459
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,030
And in that it's like a company
might not be a good fit for you.

460
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,920
You might not be a good fit for
a company.

461
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,300
And like, it's okay.

462
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,530
It's nothing against that
company.

463
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,250
It's nothing against.

464
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,350
You just like, you kind of have
to see it from an outside

465
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,740
point of view and try not to get
down on yourself about it.

466
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,280
I think it was really tough for
me to get that into

467
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,750
my head for a long time.

468
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,895
But it made things a lot better
when I was able to detach

469
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,325
from it a little bit more
personally and not feel like it

470
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,004
was an attack against myself.

471
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,044
Um, yeah,

472
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,294
Bekah: I think again, like
you're just dropping

473
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,095
every gem out there.

474
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:05,274
Um, I love that you are talking
about.

475
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,785
Pulling out of interviews.

476
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,855
I think it can be so hard,
especially when you're

477
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:12,525
looking for a role and you're
looking for one so long.

478
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:15,255
And then to think like, man,
there are a lot

479
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,545
of red flags here.

480
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:21,345
What should I, that has to be a
difficult decision to make.

481
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,855
And then, you know, also this
idea, you are also

482
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,685
interviewing them as well.

483
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:29,625
I think that, you know, that is
something that needs

484
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,785
to be really emphasizes.

485
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:33,315
People are going into
interviews.

486
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,570
I know I've done a really bad
job of like using my gut to

487
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,630
check whether or not like, okay,
this feels really awful.

488
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,830
And she's making me feel really
bad right now, but I, I probably

489
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,330
should keep trying anyway.

490
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,690
Right.

491
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,140
You know?

492
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:53,220
And so, yeah, I think those are
skills that, that

493
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,110
those are skills, right?

494
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,490
Those are things that you
develop and that you

495
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,000
Tori: build.

496
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,919
And you definitely like build
them the more you go

497
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,510
through the interview process.

498
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,270
And that was something that
like, once I started

499
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,669
having interviews, that made me
feel really good.

500
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:12,600
I started to realize how many
interviews I had had

501
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,370
that made me feel really bad.

502
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,120
um, and like made those terrible
interviews and like a lot of

503
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,850
those red flags that like, I
hadn't really recognized

504
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,979
as red flags in the past.

505
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,570
As I started having like
interviews with companies who

506
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,330
like genuinely cared about who
they were, like the person

507
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,780
that they were interviewing for,
like interviewing, um,

508
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,040
it wasn't like there are some
companies that you are just on

509
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,010
a line and they're just like
bringing you through the process

510
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,210
and you're just a number.

511
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,420
Um, but then there are also
interviews who care.

512
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,475
The candidate and their time,
there are, there

513
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:58,875
are companies that will pay you
for trial periods.

514
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,825
When I had that happen, I got
paid for a week of

515
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,495
work because the company wanted
to trial me and, you

516
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,875
know, it was, it was great.

517
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:07,515
It was very like breathtaking.

518
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,945
It was like, oh my gosh, this
actually does happen.

519
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:15,765
Um, so, um, yeah, so there
there're obviously companies.

520
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,270
Care about their candidates, um,
and treat them correctly.

521
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,720
There are some companies that
treat you like you're

522
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,070
just another number.

523
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,840
And I think that one thing that
you really have to remember

524
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,630
when you're going through the
interview process is like

525
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,470
I said before, and like you just
said, Bekah is that.

526
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:39,615
The interview process is a two
way street.

527
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:42,645
Like you are also interviewing
the company as

528
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:43,785
they are interviewing you.

529
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:48,915
Um, that is one thing that I
like really, really like drove

530
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:51,285
myself home with all the time.

531
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:53,685
I like prepared questions before
every interview.

532
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:56,775
I was like, I am going to ask
them all of the questions

533
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,205
that I need to know to know if I
want to work at

534
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:01,245
this place because yeah.

535
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,405
I wanted a job really bad, but
like, I wasn't

536
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:04,755
gonna put myself in a bad.

537
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,990
Work environment just because I
wanted a job really bad.

538
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:16,129
Like, I, I know that like, it's,
it's such a, a hard

539
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,480
thing, but I, I put myself in.

540
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:23,264
A work environment where I was
sexually harassed in the past.

541
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:27,344
And that is something that like
I would ask about diversity.

542
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:30,014
I would ask about like questions
of how they go

543
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,445
about dealing with things like
that in the workspace.

544
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:35,024
And those are tough questions to
ask during interviews.

545
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,935
But like, if it's something
that's important to you,

546
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,405
like you need to ask them.

547
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:42,314
And if the company like towers
down, when you ask

548
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,745
them those questions, it's not
somewhere that you wanna work.

549
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,195
Um, so like it.

550
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,235
It's something that like, you
have to interview

551
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,225
the company too.

552
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:55,995
And, um, at my current job, like
I, I am interviewing

553
00:27:55,995 --> 00:28:00,875
people  to work, to work with us
and, um, I am.

554
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:04,800
I I'm always thrown when
candidates don't prepare

555
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,340
questions  and they're like,
yeah, I don't have

556
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,120
any questions for you.

557
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,760
And I'm like, I literally left
like 15 minutes for you to

558
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,959
like, drill me with questions.

559
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm ready for them.

560
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:14,850
Like give 'em to me.

561
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:18,510
Like you should also be
interviewing us.

562
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,980
Like, this is very important.

563
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:22,110
Like, you should know that you
wanna work here.

564
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,870
Um, and.

565
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:28,965
Yeah, I think, I think it's so
important that like, you know,

566
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:31,905
the questions that you wanna ask
a company, you, you have to

567
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:35,265
know yourself and know what you
want out of a work environment.

568
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,975
And I think that's really
important in

569
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,145
the job search process.

570
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,965
Dan: You, um, you mentioned how
this process kind of a

571
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:45,165
skill that you build up, right?

572
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:49,095
The, the, like the way to be an
interviewer interviewee.

573
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,875
Um, I was wondering if that sort
of skill changed the way that.

574
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,175
Search for jobs or like apply,
you know, like change, which,

575
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:58,155
which companies you would apply
or which positions you would

576
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,475
apply for things like that.

577
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:04,125
As you sort of went through the
process, um, you know,

578
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,645
if you could talk about like how
you try to find different

579
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,195
positions to apply for, um, or
if that changed, you know,

580
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,215
from the start to the end.

581
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,175
Tori: Yeah.

582
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:14,925
It definitely changed from the
start to the, to the end of it.

583
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:19,275
Um, at the beginning I was kind
of applying to like everything.

584
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,880
Everything that I could find.

585
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,630
Honestly, when I first started
looking for a job,

586
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,520
I wasn't, I wasn't being picky
about working backend.

587
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,410
I was like, I'm gonna apply to
front end positions.

588
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,490
I'm gonna apply to full stack.

589
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,390
I'm gonna apply to backend.

590
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:34,230
I'm apply to everything.

591
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,780
Um,  and.

592
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:39,375
Man.

593
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:41,534
That was, that was a mistake.

594
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,554
I think.

595
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,465
I mean, like you, you spend so
much time

596
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:47,115
putting in applications.

597
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:50,205
And I think even at the
beginning, I wasn't

598
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,945
tailoring my resume to meet the
job application.

599
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:57,615
Like if I would've done that, I
would've spent like so many more

600
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:01,665
hours because I, it was, it.

601
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:05,715
Ridiculous that I was applying
to as many companies

602
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:07,335
as I was at the beginning.

603
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:12,135
Um, and towards, I don't know, a
few months in, I started

604
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:17,415
to realize that I needed to do
quality of a quantity.

605
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:22,515
And I started tailoring my
resume and cover letter to the

606
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:24,585
applications I was sending in.

607
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:29,145
Um, I was really trying to make
contacts with people

608
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,765
who worked at the company.

609
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:37,590
Um, I, I really started to, to
try to like put my best foot

610
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,650
forward, rather than just like
sending in an application to

611
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:48,390
the unknown , um, where like
hundreds of other applications

612
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:52,320
also go, uh, I started to
realize when I was applying

613
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,550
everywhere that often more often
than not, I, I wasn't

614
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,820
really getting replies back at
all, rejections or.

615
00:31:00,435 --> 00:31:02,175
Like interest for interviews.

616
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:07,155
Um, and I was applying to big
companies and small companies.

617
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:11,535
I, yeah, I, I was applying to
everything

618
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,795
under the, under the sun.

619
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:17,325
And then eventually I learned
that, um, I

620
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,254
learned what I wanted.

621
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,535
I like, I started to realize
through some of

622
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:22,485
the interview processes that I
was going through.

623
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:28,725
The bigger companies were the
companies that did those like

624
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,305
crazy technical interviews that
were like, here's this

625
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:32,895
crazy algorithm solve it.

626
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:37,755
And the startups were more the
ones of like giving take homes

627
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,665
or like walking, like pair
programming more like Laly I

628
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,915
guess, like it wasn't such a
high stress type of environment.

629
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:51,345
Um, so.

630
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,870
I think that like, eventually
through that, that interview

631
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,899
process of like going through
the interviews with

632
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,940
different types of companies, I
learned that I wanted to

633
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,470
stay more towards startup.

634
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,470
Um, it seemed like it was more
the environment of what I

635
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:08,700
would want to work in because I
mean, I think we all kind

636
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,899
of recognize that these crazy

637
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,740
algorithm interviews are just,
they're not applicable to.

638
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:23,685
The daily job that you do there.

639
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:29,415
It's not a, I don't know, it's
not an indicator.

640
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,215
I don't think it's an indicator
of like how good

641
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,415
you're gonna do at this job.

642
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:35,445
I, I really think that it's,
it's messy.

643
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:41,325
And, um, I think that there are
startups and smaller

644
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:46,095
companies that are kind of going
against the grain of what the

645
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:47,264
larger companies are doing.

646
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:47,685
And.

647
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,405
I think that I personally made
the decision that I would rather

648
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:52,545
work for a company like that.

649
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:57,405
So, you know, started tailoring
my, um, applications

650
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,375
towards startups and smaller
sized companies.

651
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,075
And then eventually I made the
decision.

652
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,345
Yeah.

653
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:04,365
I wanna work back end.

654
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:05,505
I don't wanna do full stack.

655
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,425
I don't wanna do front end,
started tailoring

656
00:33:07,425 --> 00:33:08,325
them more that way.

657
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:13,155
Um, So I think through the
process, I started applying

658
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:16,725
to everything and then I like
funneled down  and

659
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:18,915
eventually like became a little
bit more specialized

660
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,324
in what I was applying to.

661
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,264
And I started, I realized that I
was getting more responses,

662
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,395
more interviews that way.

663
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:27,004
So that was.

664
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,020
That was great.

665
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,580
I think that's so

666
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:29,910
Bekah: great.

667
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,630
And I think that especially, uh,
when you're fresh out of

668
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,660
school or bootcamp or whatever,
when you're first applying,

669
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,740
there's this tendency for a lot
of people just to start learning

670
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,960
everything at like a very.

671
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,600
Shallow level, because I think
that's going to make them more,

672
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,090
um, relevant in job search.

673
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,930
But I think that you're right
specializing or really

674
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,590
understanding yourself and what
you are interested

675
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,540
in can, can be useful.

676
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:02,990
I mean, it also can help you to
be more excited about what

677
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,930
you're doing and more relaxed.

678
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,180
And when you're in an interview
and you can.

679
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:12,655
Act in that way, it definitely
makes you a, a candidate

680
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:13,705
that seems confident.

681
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:14,275
I think.

682
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,000
Tori: I think you definitely
come off better.

683
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,830
Um, so

684
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,170
Bekah: you have touched on this
a couple of times,

685
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,420
but like, obviously there's an
industry problem with

686
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,380
interviewing, right.

687
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,040
And we see more people talking
about it.

688
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,130
Um, and I wonder what you think
about, or if you have

689
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,240
ideas about how to improve the
interview process, but

690
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,250
like also keeping in mind.

691
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:44,595
Is it an industry problem?

692
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:51,075
Is it a, um, my bootcamp or my
university didn't train me

693
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:55,185
well enough before going into
the job market, a combination

694
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:59,565
or, you know, what are your
thoughts on, you know, this

695
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,545
process and making it better?

696
00:35:02,385 --> 00:35:03,075
Tori: Yeah.

697
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:10,125
Um, I think, I think first to
touch on the whole like

698
00:35:10,305 --> 00:35:15,615
bootcamp and, um, computer
science degree thing.

699
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:20,685
I think bootcamps do, um, some
bootcamps are great.

700
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,775
Some bootcamps are not just like
some computer

701
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:26,655
science degree programs are
great and some are not.

702
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:31,515
Um, I, I have a friend who got a
computer science degree.

703
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,620
Like he knew a lot of the, the
theory and principal stuff, but

704
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,950
didn't really know how to code.

705
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,355
Um, and he struggled to find a
software engineering job.

706
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:48,255
He ended up finding a support
job, um, and has

707
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,445
kind of been stuck in that.

708
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:54,585
But he's finally got outta
finally got out of it recently

709
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,255
and just moved to Columbus, Ohio
and is working for a startup

710
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,365
and I'm super happy for him.

711
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:02,925
Um, but it took some time for
him to like pull out of that.

712
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,505
And I think.

713
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,930
I also struggled with my
interview process because

714
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,210
I came from a bootcamp cuz I
didn't know the

715
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,100
computer science like stuff.

716
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,850
I think there's weaknesses in
both areas.

717
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:21,450
Some bootcamps, maybe great at
teaching that stuff.

718
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,230
And they like the students come
out well rounded.

719
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,170
Some computer science degrees
are that way.

720
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,740
Um, but there's weaknesses in
everything.

721
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,720
Um, and.

722
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:42,675
I think that not everybody comes
out well rounded and to, as an

723
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:51,060
industry to expect . Brand new,
like entry level engineers to

724
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,880
solve these crazy algorithms.

725
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,230
Like, I mean, even senior
engineers, I've like, I've

726
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,110
heard, I've spoken to a few of
them who are terrified

727
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,930
to go back into the job market
because they would

728
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:05,130
have to do these things.

729
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,380
They don't feel comfortable
doing it either.

730
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,820
Which like, I think just that
fact alone that like, it doesn't

731
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,290
matter what level you are.

732
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,720
Whether you're entry, you're
senior you're principal.

733
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,280
Like it doesn't matter.

734
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,110
Like you can be just as afraid
of these crazy algorithm

735
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,500
questions as anyone else.

736
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,430
And I think that that speaks to
the fact that like somebody

737
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,120
with 10 years industry
experience can't solve it.

738
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,670
I.

739
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,690
I, why are you giving them if
it's something that

740
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,270
somebody has been working, like
doing this job for 10

741
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,790
years, like you would expect
them to be able to answer it

742
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,210
Bekah: easily.

743
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:47,549
But they can't

744
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:52,560
Tori: and it like it's, I, I
definitely think it's broken.

745
00:37:52,799 --> 00:38:00,540
I think that there's been this
idea that solving

746
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,910
these algorithms is a great way
to get to know

747
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,589
how the candidate thinks.

748
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:07,529
Like, if you wanna know how the
candidate thinks

749
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,830
or plans, then like speak to
them about planning.

750
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,820
Or like, like ask them those
types of driven questions.

751
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,090
Don't try to pull that out by
asking like some crazy,

752
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,500
like, weird question and like
try to get about it and get

753
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,700
to it in a roundabout way.

754
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,060
Like that's not, it doesn't seem
efficient.

755
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
It doesn't like, I, I don't know
it to me.

756
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:37,540
It just, everything seems kind
of broken and I feel like.

757
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,730
One day, one of these big tech
companies was like, we're gonna

758
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,580
ask this question and we have a
great interview process.

759
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,720
And like, it's really hard.

760
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,630
And then all of these other
companies were like, oh, we're

761
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,860
gonna implement that too.

762
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,530
And it's just been like a
copycat process.

763
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,230
And a lot of companies wanna be
like these big tech companies.

764
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,560
So they just, they just copied
the process and.

765
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,710
Whether it's good for their
company or company

766
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,140
or not, whether it's beneficial
for them or not.

767
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:09,029
And it's, I don't know.

768
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:14,220
I think, I think like a lot of
things, the head of industries

769
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,879
set a lot of standards that they
kind of like set those

770
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:24,149
standards and everybody follows
just, it's not necessarily,

771
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:31,875
uh, Not necessarily the best
thing  and it's tough and it's

772
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,285
tough to go against the grain.

773
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:37,215
But I think that there are a lot
of startups out there and

774
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:40,245
a lot of smaller companies and
even some like decently

775
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,395
large companies that are going
against the grain.

776
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:46,815
And I think that that's
wonderful that it's

777
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:50,805
being recognized that our
interview process is broken.

778
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:54,875
It's great that people are like
really standing up and being

779
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,315
like candidates are people too.

780
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:58,835
you need to respect their time.

781
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:02,465
You need to respect, like giving
somebody a take

782
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:03,515
home project or something.

783
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,045
That's gonna take four to six
hours.

784
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,845
That's a huge chunk of their
time.

785
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:12,515
I like, I just, if you're not
gonna pay them for

786
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:14,555
that work, it's crazy.

787
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:18,005
Like doing a two hour, one is
still a lot, but

788
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:19,715
I that's more reasonable.

789
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,620
It's I, it's just tough.

790
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,460
I think that there's a lot of, a
lot of things that are wrong in

791
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,120
the interview or yeah, like in
the interview process right now.

792
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,890
Um, and I'm not sure that there
is a blanket way to fix it.

793
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,370
Like it's really gonna be case
by case company by company.

794
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,570
And I think just recognizing
that there is an issue is the

795
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,400
first step to fixing the issue.

796
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,750
Um, and I think having more
people.

797
00:40:50,235 --> 00:40:53,535
Being outspoken about it is like
really important because

798
00:40:53,535 --> 00:41:01,395
it's gonna start pushing, um,
it's gonna start pushing

799
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,985
people that are the heads of
these companies and whatnot

800
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:11,295
to like, kind of look at their
processes and kind of.

801
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:16,365
Adjust and see what could be
going wrong and like

802
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:20,805
why people are unhappy and, you
know, we'll see.

803
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:23,505
Bekah: Yeah.

804
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:27,735
I, um, was talking to somebody
recently about the situation

805
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:34,995
in this, um, what you said it
not being a blanket.

806
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:38,685
Um, Like one, one answer for it.

807
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:39,194
Right.

808
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,714
And that we're looking at people
and people are complex.

809
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,274
I think really sticks out to me.

810
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:47,145
Um, in finding this idea of like
a, a person first

811
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:48,855
interview process is important.

812
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:52,125
And, um, one guy was saying,
well, well like, well, we

813
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,674
have to standardize it as best
as we possibly can.

814
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,785
And like, I, anytime that I hear
that, it just makes me cringe

815
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:02,685
a little bit because you can't
really standardize the process.

816
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:05,145
And I think if you're trying to
standardize.

817
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,960
Sanitizes things in some way,
and you don't see the complex

818
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,160
person and you're not allowing
for different perspectives.

819
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,340
And in that way, you are
probably cutting out some really

820
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:21,030
amazing candidates because maybe
they don't perform well

821
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,350
while you're staring at them or
with a timed test or something,

822
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,250
you know, there's all of these
problems and it's not just in

823
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,180
tech, but, um, not allowing for.

824
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:39,479
I think diversity of approach or
allowing a candidate to

825
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,049
fully explore what they would do
is really not good for

826
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:47,609
the company or the industry

827
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:48,149
Tori: either.

828
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,520
No, definitely not.

829
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:57,089
And it feels that would be
really hindering on some people

830
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:58,250
like you're not letting them.

831
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,650
Like show you their full
potential.

832
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:08,640
You're not letting them have a
creative mind or like

833
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,879
showing you something that you
wouldn't have thought of.

834
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:17,100
Like, if you're, if you're
setting a standard, it's you

835
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,230
also, you cut people out.

836
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,580
Of the process.

837
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,120
Like I, when you start setting
standards, I think that's

838
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:30,779
when you really start to get
into the issue of like really

839
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:36,480
messing with minority people and
you start messing with.

840
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,960
A lot of stuff.

841
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,980
Yeah, go ahead, Dan.

842
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,890
Dan: sorry to, I was just gonna
say, then you just

843
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,230
start hiring people that are
good at the stand getting

844
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,220
through the standard process.

845
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,530
It's like, this is the same
problem with the standardized

846
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,420
tests in public schools, you
know, um, all of the, like

847
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,390
then all of the learning will be
about trying to, you know,

848
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,565
Get through the standard test or
whatever it is.

849
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,755
I mean, this happens in schools,
but like, if that was the

850
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:04,245
process with interviews, you
know, and it already sort of

851
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:08,475
happens, there's so much effort
gone into, um, like that course

852
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:12,435
you bought was like, you know,
you used it to learn a specific

853
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,075
thing, but it was geared towards
passing technical interviews.

854
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:15,345
Right.

855
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,125
Like that was the whole thing.

856
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:16,365
Yeah.

857
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:21,375
And, uh, and like the there's a
lot of people, you know,

858
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,795
making money on that sort of
thing anyway, and so

859
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,865
much time and effort, and then
you get your job and.

860
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,420
You never use any of, any of
that stuff ever again.

861
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:30,780
Right?

862
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,410
Any of those skills?

863
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,460
I mean, obviously not totally
true, but there's just so

864
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,280
much, so much, uh, you know,
sweat that you put into

865
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,510
getting good at something.

866
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,230
And then like a lot of that
isn't transferable or doesn't

867
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,090
transfer, you know, to what
you're actually doing anyway.

868
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,175
Um, yeah.

869
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:50,325
Tori: And you hear all these
like crazy stories of

870
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:53,685
people who essentially train
themselves for the interview

871
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,325
process and then they get in and
they can't do the job.

872
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:56,745
Yeah.

873
00:44:57,105 --> 00:44:57,855
Bekah: 100%.

874
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,595
Tori: No it's.

875
00:44:59,605 --> 00:44:59,895
Yeah.

876
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,385
And like, how are these
companies filtering for that?

877
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:05,055
You can't, because like you're
not actually

878
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:06,225
testing for things that.

879
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,420
Job applicable , which is

880
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,050
Dan: crazy.

881
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,350
Yeah.

882
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,220
It's a hard problem.

883
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,200
And it's, and it's a hard
problem from the

884
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,100
employers side too.

885
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,790
You know, the smaller company is
the easier, I think it is.

886
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,580
So the company you started
working for, you know, you're

887
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
a man, I don't remember what
position, but whoever hired

888
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,560
you, you know, like sat and like
worked with you, like

889
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,730
talked with you for a while.

890
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,690
And that's really, I agree the
best way to find if a

891
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,190
person fits all of that stuff.

892
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,029
Um, but.

893
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:37,035
That's time consuming on their
end, you know, to, and you get

894
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,075
a large company where there's
literally millions of people

895
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:43,575
applying for a position  and
the, you know, they can kind

896
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,005
of see how this stuff happens.

897
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:48,015
Not, not that the solution is
good, but

898
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,235
like how they got there.

899
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:50,625
Right.

900
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,295
You know, just because just so
many people

901
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:57,165
applying and there are
programmers on the other end.

902
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:01,215
You know, like trying to
optimize it, like, you know,

903
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,345
like Bekah was saying, I'm sure
the person you were talking

904
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,865
to that said that we should
standardize the process was,

905
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:07,605
uh, in development somewhere.

906
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:11,025
I'm guessing, you know, cuz
that's the kind of, uh, like

907
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:12,975
that's the kind of answer that
you jump to first.

908
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:13,125
Right.

909
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:16,275
If I see a problem, I'm like,
okay, how can like, how can

910
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,375
we fix this with my hammer?

911
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:20,175
That is, you know, that is like
development,

912
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:20,745
you know what I mean?

913
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:22,845
but it's not a development
problem.

914
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:22,995
Right.

915
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:23,685
It's a people problem.

916
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:25,735
So mm-hmm  I.

917
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,045
I don't really have a point
there.

918
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,775
It's just a  it's a very complex
problem.

919
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:33,465
Tori: Um, yeah, it, it is a very
complex problem.

920
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:35,415
I absolutely love everything
that you said.

921
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:41,475
So it's yeah, it's, it's a tough
topic.

922
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:42,695
It's a really tough topic.

923
00:46:44,295 --> 00:46:44,625
Bekah: Yeah.

924
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:45,045
Yeah.

925
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:48,765
I, and I think I step one is
talking about it, right?

926
00:46:49,635 --> 00:46:49,875
yep.

927
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:51,615
Thinking about it.

928
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,645
Step one on a larger scale, if
you can, and just like

929
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,795
realizing and identifying.

930
00:46:58,305 --> 00:46:59,535
The things that are wrong.

931
00:46:59,745 --> 00:47:02,265
And sometimes it's hard to put
those things

932
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:03,825
into words, I think.

933
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:07,095
Or like, you're not exactly sure
why they're wrong, but

934
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:09,735
just acknowledging like,
something feels bad about this.

935
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:10,215
Right.

936
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:13,305
And then kind of building from
there and talking

937
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:14,625
to other people is.

938
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,745
Is moving in the right
direction.

939
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:17,955
Right.

940
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:20,685
You need to get some momentum,
so start there and

941
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:22,095
then keep moving forward.

942
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:25,005
And then, you know, definitely
have a support system as

943
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:28,245
you're going through the
interview process because it is

944
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,305
Tori: hard mm-hmm  yeah, it's
really hard.

945
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:34,965
And I think honestly, virtual
coffee kind of

946
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:38,355
came about right at the perfect
time for me because.

947
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:40,634
Interviewing did slow down a
ton.

948
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:42,945
And I really felt like I had
lost my momentum and was

949
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,355
feeling kind of down on myself.

950
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:49,245
And when interviews started
going well again, I was like

951
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:53,025
posting a bit and I was getting
cheered on and, you know, it was

952
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:55,215
just, it was great at the time.

953
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:59,415
And also when sad things happen,
like you don't get a job, like

954
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,555
you're told, like don't give up
and, you know, it's, it's a

955
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:05,985
great community to be a part of.

956
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:08,055
And I think.

957
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:13,125
I don't wanna say we're all
cheerleaders, but like , we're

958
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:19,245
all very positive and, um, very
much like pushing for one

959
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:22,965
another to do our best and to
keep our heads held high and

960
00:48:23,415 --> 00:48:24,975
not get too down on ourselves.

961
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,115
So it's great.

962
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,470
Wanna, thank

963
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,850
Bekah: you so much for being
here.

964
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,610
Tori, you said so many awesome
things.

965
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:37,260
Um, what are some things that
you have coming up or

966
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,820
things that you're interested

967
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,060
Tori: in?

968
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:40,424
Yeah.

969
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,875
Um, well, one huge thing coming
up.

970
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:49,484
I'm expecting my baby in my .
Um, but yeah, besides that,

971
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:54,134
I am kind of just trying to get
used to, you know, working

972
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:58,605
I'm about to hit my six months
mark of officially working as a

973
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,694
software engineer and I'm really
excited to hit it and I'm.

974
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:05,685
I'm almost getting to like full
autonomy and working

975
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:07,695
on my own, which is great.

976
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:13,455
Um, my coworkers are great,
confident, confident boosters.

977
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:17,565
They are like, I'm like, uh, can
we pair on this ticket?

978
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:22,815
And they're like, you got this,
you got this, like, okay, that

979
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:24,075
happened this morning again.

980
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,575
it keeps happening.

981
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:31,215
Um  but yeah, it's, it's fun.

982
00:49:31,565 --> 00:49:31,785
I'm.

983
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,700
I'm just excited to continue
working and building

984
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,050
my backend skills and.

985
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,310
I am hoping to move into site
reliability

986
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,290
engineering in the future.

987
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,779
And I'm like slowly reading
through the Google

988
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:47,339
site, reliability book.

989
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:53,700
And, uh, I'm working with our
site reliability engineer

990
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:57,630
and our head of engineering who
used to be an SRE, um,

991
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,960
going through some things, uh,
on our product and learning

992
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,569
a little bit about that stuff as
well as my backend.

993
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,529
So.

994
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:05,715
It's fun.

995
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:06,765
They're grooming me.

996
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:09,075
They're getting me ready and I'm
really liking it.

997
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:10,245
So it's great.

998
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:13,845
Bekah: that is very awesome.

999
00:50:13,935 --> 00:50:14,865
Um, okay.

1000
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:18,795
So if our listeners want to find
you, how can they do that?

1001
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:25,635
Tori: Yeah, I am over on Twitter
and I need to look up.

1002
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:29,325
I never remember my username,
your underscore T O

1003
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:32,085
Bekah: O R R.

1004
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:33,675
We'll include it in the show
notes.

1005
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:34,245
Yeah.

1006
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:36,255
And then you're also blogging

1007
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,105
Tori: over at dev two, right?

1008
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:40,515
Yes, I am.

1009
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:43,785
I've it's, it's been a little
bit since I've posted on there.

1010
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:47,775
Um, I've been writing on my
work, uh, on my company's

1011
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:54,375
blog a bit more, um, because
when  I joined, I was like

1012
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:59,395
super excited to start writing
for the blog and, um, Yeah.

1013
00:50:59,395 --> 00:50:59,635
Yeah.

1014
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,225
It's I don't know.

1015
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,235
I really enjoy it, but I've got
