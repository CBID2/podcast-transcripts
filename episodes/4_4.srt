Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we got
to talk to Mark Noonan. Mark is

12
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:34,322
a

13
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:36,333
senior engineer at Cypress.io
and is a co-organizer at Code

14
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,343
for

15
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:41,404

00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,682
with

18
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,734
developmental disabilities at
home, work and in the community.

19
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:51,219
Um, mark shared with us how his
background in music and theater

20
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,864
informs his work as a developer,
which I found really

21
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,509
interesting.

22
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:56,649
And then we spent the rest of
the episode talking about his

23
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,889
experience in civic tech, how
working with local civic tech

24
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,518
groups can benefit your
community, uh, can benefit other

25
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:06,819
developers and, and of course
your own career as a developer.

26
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:10,215
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

27
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:13,365
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

28
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,745
we're from, we do and a random
check-in question. We hope you

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:28,510
enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question. Is,

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,980
would you rather be the funniest
or the smartest person in the

31
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,515
room? So my name is Bekah. I am
a front end developer from a

32
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:38,050
small

33
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,625
town in Ohio. And I think I
would like to be the funniest

34
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,199
person in

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,460
the room it, because it makes it
easier to talk to people. And

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,010
you're more likable, I think.
And my grandma was funny and I

37
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,560
always

38
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,691
want to be as funny as my
grandma. So I'm going with that.

39
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:01,516
Dan: Uh, hi, I'm Dan. I am a
developer from Cleveland, Ohio.

40
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:05,686
And, um, yeah, I don't know. I
feel like lots of times the

41
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:10,036
funniest person often is pretty
smart anyway, you know, um, like

42
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,586
I don't want to be the person in
the room that everybody's

43
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,351
laughing at, you know, but, um,
right. So sure. I, I would take

44
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,116
a

45
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:24,360
funniest person and then. that
means you are absolutely not the

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,931
smartest person in the room, you
know? Uh, but like could still

47
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,330
have second place or something.
I think that's, I think that's

48
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:30,661
good.

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,195
Bekah: So now you're claiming
second place. Smartest first

50
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:34,635
Second place smart

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,411
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as long
as that's in the realm of

52
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,320
possibility, I'm not saying, you
know, I'm not saying that's, I'm

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,561
saying, you know, this, this
exercise, you know, if I say I'm

54
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,730
always the smartest or the
funniest person in the room, you

55
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,520
know, but it's not like saying
that means you're also the least

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,871
smart person in the room.

57
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,170
Bekah: No, that was not one

58
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,901
Dan: It's still open. Yeah.
That's what I'm saying. So it's

59
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,311
still, it's still possibility. I
could at least still imagine

60
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,721
that

61
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,151
I'm the second smartest person
in the room.

62
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:00,610
Bekah: right.

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,161
Dan: If I've made this choice.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,450
Bekah: You're the funniest you
can imagine that you are the

65
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,621
second smartest person.

66
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,151
Dan: All right. That's it.
That's my answer. Yes.

67
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,035
Mark: All right. Um, and I'm
Mark Noonan. I am a senior

68
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,604
engineer at

69
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:18,195
cypress.io. Um, I live in
Atlanta, Georgia, and I'm mostly

70
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:22,276
happy just to be in the room.
That's good for me. Um, I

71
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,076
probably would prefer to be the
funniest person than the

72
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:25,876
smartest

73
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,915
person. Uh, if I had to make
that choice, but in this

74
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,954
specific room

75
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:33,256
with the two of you, I will take
first place, smartest person

76
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,716
ahead of Dan and

77
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:36,015
Dan: I mean

78
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,626
Bekah: Gues I'm third place
then,

79
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,635
Dan: somebody had do it.

80
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:40,616
Mark: if, this how the

81
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,596
Bekah: I'm gonna fight for
funniest. And then I'll be third

82
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,316
place. First smartest.

83
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,265
Dan: I mean, I called dibs on
second place. I don't know what

84
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:47,566
to tell you.

85
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,596
Bekah: I didn't even know that
was an option. wasn't an option.

86
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,376
You made it up.

87
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,006
Dan: That's it. Listen, I always
gotta call dibs when its

88
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:56,121
available.

89
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,681
Mark: Everbody in a room of
three it's. Okay. Everybody's

90
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:59,241
walking

91
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,441
away with something yet.

92
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,735
Bekah: I I like I have lost in
the, I got the participation

93
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:10,395
ribbon I got purple ribbon.
Welcome Mark, and is really good

94
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:13,695
to have you here with us and
being the smartest person in the

95
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,830
room. so we'll let you do most
of the talking today. Um, we

96
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,965
always

97
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,915
like to start off with your
origin story, how you got to

98
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,864
this

99
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,946
point of where you are in your
developer career. So you could

100
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,115
give us your overview, we would
love here it.

101
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:34,565
Mark: Okay. Um, I'm going to try
to remove some of the twists and

102
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,495
turns. Um, but the short version
is I kind of thought about doing

103
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,615
this job really since I was a
teenager, I started making

104
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,145
websites and stuff like that.
Um, but when I was like 16, 17,

105
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,675
yeah.

106
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:50,776
I was in Ireland where I grew up
and I was learning bits and

107
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,426
pieces of programming and
hitting some problems. And I

108
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,076
just hit a

109
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:57,196
point where I was sure this was
not for me. Like you had to be

110
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,336
more into maths. You have to be
smarter than I was to be good at

111
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:05,475
programming. Um, and a lot of
that had to do with what was

112
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,170
available to me. Education wise,
if you get stuck with a book

113
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,865
that

114
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:13,935
you got from the library, um,
just very hard, like back then,

115
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,750
this is right around the year,
2000, it's a little bit harder

116
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,565
to

117
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:21,615
get resources than it is today.
So I ended up going to college

118
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,490
for music and English and, um,
did a master's in

119
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,365
ethnomusicology

120
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:28,485
like That's my education
background loved all of that

121
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,120
stuff, but I kind of kept
getting sucked into making

122
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,755
websites on

123
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:38,776
the side. Um, and gradually like
found more and more things where

124
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,026
I'm like, oh, I wish I could do
that. So I could make this for

125
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:45,300
this reason, for this family
business or whatever. Yeah. And

126
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,130
eventually found myself finding
things like free code camp and

127
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,960
CS

128
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:54,690
50, um, using those courses to
learn more. that kind of got me

129
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,235
into the Atlanta Free Code Camp
Community, which got me

130
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,780
connected

131
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,560
to Code for Atlanta, which is
like civic tech code for America

132
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,100
non-profit work, which really
aligned with the, my day job,

133
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,510
which was at a nonprofit,
working with adults with

134
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,890
developmental

135
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:11,610
disabilities. Um, so I just kept
doing more stuff and learning

136
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,598
more things until like, it was
kind of obvious. I was able to

137
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,586
do

138
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:16,966
this for a job and it was time
to start thinking about

139
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,346
switching.

140
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:24,985
And so that led me to, being
developer Twitter, following

141
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,185
people, uh, connecting with
people there. And that kind of

142
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,036
introduced me to some places
where I could interview and

143
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,251
slowly get better at
interviewing. And then, you

144
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,466
know,

145
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,036
I found a job.

146
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,130
Bekah: That's awesome. I love
the non-traditional backgrounds

147
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,720
and I

148
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,300
feel like we hear a lot of
people that have come from music

149
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,355
backgrounds and made the
transition into dev world. And

150
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,410
my

151
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,130
background's in English too. Did
you find like you were able to

152
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,031
use any transferable skills or
that background helped you in

153
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,420
some way as you learned to code?

154
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,115
Mark: I I think looking back,
there are a couple of ways. Um,

155
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:03,935
is like you practice music,
you're able to get into flow as

156
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,281
you play. Um, and so there's
this. It happens with writing

157
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,646
too, where you have this
experience on your own of

158
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,011
working

159
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,500
on something and being in the
moment of like, and stuff coming

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,090
together. it can still be
challenging, but it's sort of

161
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,680
fun

162
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,550
and you don't notice the time
passing. Um, and it seems like

163
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,980
when we're learning development
or actually doing like the

164
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,680
day-to-day work, um, being able
to get into that state, um, kind

165
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,920
of on-demand is really useful so
that you can actually settle in

166
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,141
and achieve something and a few
hours. Without quite having a

167
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:41,130
full plan going in how you do
it. I think that's useful from

168
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,880
playing an instrument. Um, also
we used to have to read like big

169
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,965
symphony scores or just lots of
interconnected pieces. And

170
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,050
you're

171
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,940
supposed to be able to talk
about how they work together.

172
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,830
And I was

173
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,975
never like really that into the
theory part of what we were

174
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,119
doing

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,047
in college, but it did exercise
a part of my brain that was

176
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,974
like,

177
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,826
and same with plays and with,
with any kind of complicated

178
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:05,940
structures you're supposed to
get into, um, theater was a big

179
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,054
thing

180
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:11,745
for me in college. And so the
combination of like thinking

181
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:16,516
about a hour or two long play as
a whole script and writing some

182
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:19,171
and directing some as well as,
we have this big, complicated

183
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,826
thing

184
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:24,016
but we have 48 hours to build
all the sets and stand this show

185
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,636
up

186
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,030
and do it for a week. And
there's a lot of rushing around

187
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,424
as well

188
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,625
as trying to maintain this
complicated. Like, so all of

189
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,926
that, at least I feel like it
exercise some of the same stuff

190
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:41,346
mentally for me that I'm using
now being directly like how to

191
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,066
write a form in HTML or
something.

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,081
Dan: I love that. Never really
connected the flow state thing

193
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:52,311
with you. You're totally right
with me between music and, and

194
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,495
developing. Um, I like the, I
mean, I just really liked the

195
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:56,610
way

196
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,581
you described that and it is
true. Like once you said it, you

197
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,860
know, I thought I thought about
it and it is the exact same way.

198
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,530
Like, and you can feel when
you're not in it too, you know,

199
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,931
but you can feel when you're in
it. And that idea of like,

200
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,855
putting, just getting started on
something and not knowing

201
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,580
exactly

202
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,671
how it's going to turn out, but
you're, you know, and it it's

203
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,650
like you're driving it, but it's
still like you're in that flow,

204
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,681
so you're not forcing it. And at
the end, something, hopefully at

205
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,150
least something, something has
come out, um, I, I had never, I

206
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,950
never connected those, those
two, the music, like the music

207
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,750
flows

208
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,270
state and then developing flow
state before. I, I really

209
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,201
appreciate that. That was cool.

210
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,416
Bekah: Yeah, I liked that a lot.
And like, thinking about how all

211
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,546
of the pieces are working
together and whatever you're

212
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:41,625
doing. that sometimes we think
about transferable skills, like,

213
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,655
okay. And how do they exactly
match up? But you're talking

214
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,946
about like exercising, the same
muscles or the same part of your

215
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:51,196
brain to learn new things. And
you know, if you're breaking

216
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,446
down

217
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:56,512
a poem if you are matching
patterns, is. When you're

218
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,369
writing

219
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,910
or playing music, those are all
things that we're doing as

220
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,130
coders. It doesn't necessarily
mean that we can understand

221
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,610
directly how that works, but I
think it certainly helps to

222
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,090
build

223
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:15,750
those skills as we learn new
things.

224
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:20,520
Mark: Yeah. And I think it sort
of, when I started to listen to

225
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,521
specific podcasts, as
programmers were talking, this

226
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,591
is what kind

227
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,221
of helped me go from learning on
my own to being able to with

228
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,185
others and interact with other
developers. was like, I got

229
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,149
quite

230
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,640
far on my own, but I didn't know
how to say any of the words out

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,721
loud. So listening to podcasts,
when called Coding Blocks and

232
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,931
stuff like Code Newbie. And let
me hear how developers were

233
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:46,980
talking. And one concept was
like levels of abstraction. And

234
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,720
they're talking about not mixing
levels of abstraction, which

235
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,460
when

236
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:55,890
you're new that's a complicated
concept because you have, you're

237
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,410
not sure what levels of
extraction means. Let alone to

238
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,681
know if you're mixing them or
not. Um, but when I start to

239
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:05,520
think of like, yeah, you can
spend time looking at a single

240
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,130
line in a, in a play or
something or, uh, the

241
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,740
conversation or the

242
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,821
whole scene and zoom out further
to see how things like structure

243
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:21,750
really relate to each other. Um,
and understanding what layer of

244
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,591
the structure you're in, when
you're doing something. Yeah.

245
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,451
Like the ability to zoom in and
out to a specific layer and

246
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:33,360
understand its purpose and the
structure connected above and

247
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,640
below it. Um, that is hard to
like articulate, I think, in

248
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,500
programming because it's often
so abstract. but when you're

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,360
making

250
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,431
art, you have to think about
those layers all the time,

251
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,801
because you're working on the
details of a piece and on the

252
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,160
whole, the whole piece and each
script do it seamlessly without

253
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,461
knowing that you're zooming in
and out. Um, but I do think they

254
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,100
kind of relate.

255
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,640
Bekah: Oh, absolutely. And I
love that that's, that was such

256
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,020
a

257
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,015
great description of how you
kind of look at things together

258
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,010
and,

259
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,095
and have to break it apart at
the same time and move back at

260
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:05,550
that.

261
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:13,456
It is it's like, um, I was gonna
like, when. No, it's not coming

262
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:17,625
there. was something in there
about like being blurry and not

263
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,696
being blurry, but.

264
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:22,250
Mark: no, I think that you like,
especially with your background

265
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,440
in writing. There's a first
draft where you cannot get lost

266
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,630
in the

267
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,975
details, or you'll never finish
the first draft. Um, and that's

268
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,320
a

269
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:35,030
whole different layer of the
work, trying to get something

270
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,250
that has roughly the structure
you want. Um, and it's, uh, it's

271
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,705
so difficult to make progress if
you get stuck on one paragraph

272
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,160
or

273
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,941
one sentence. Um, and I actually
I'm bad at that. I don't write

274
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,926
and never wrote novels or
attempted to write a novel. Um,

275
00:12:54,076 --> 00:13:00,755
because cannot, um, sustain that
first draft mode long enough to,

276
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,765
to really produce something like
that. So I ended up really

277
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:06,436
liking, working in theater,
really liking, working on poems

278
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:11,385
and songs because that lives in
the zoomed in world of a smaller

279
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:12,855
structure where I feel happy,
and I feel like it's okay to

280
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,325
spend

281
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,316
time working on sentences,
paragraphs, words, line breaks.

282
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:21,812
Okay. And uh, if I try to write
a 400 page novel like that, I

283
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:24,269
just

284
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,150
would never, ever get it done.
Um, so yeah, I think that that

285
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,061
blurry not blurry makes some
sense in that sense.

286
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,600
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. And you know,
like when you're going there's,

287
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,880
your rough draft, right. For no
matter what you do, like you can

288
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,186
have a coding, rough draft to
where you're. Get it working.

289
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:50,056
Right. But that you can make the
code better. so I think even

290
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:52,936
like, if you break down the
process, you can pseudo code

291
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,751
something and then you can code
and make it work. And that's

292
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,566
your

293
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,516
second draft. And then you can
go back and do those revisions

294
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,466
that

295
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:04,456
really make it do what you want
it to do, but also like how you

296
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,285
want it to do it in the most
efficient way that you can. Um,

297
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:08,114
I

298
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,870
like thinking of that as part of
the process. I don't think that

299
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,625
I

300
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:14,865
thought about that before, but
that makes a lot of sense to me.

301
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,365
Mark: Yeah, lately, I've started
a routine where I will do that.

302
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:22,115
Get it working past first, even
if it's horrendous. Um, and then

303
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,086
I will write the tests for the
thing that I just wrote that's

304
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:29,466
working so that, um, I can go
through and refactor and try to

305
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:34,650
make it right. Code-wise and you
know, to think about reuse and

306
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,561
thinking about readability and
stuff. Um, and then at a certain

307
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,316
point, I know it's still wrong,
but I have to cut it off and

308
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,071
make

309
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:45,120
a pull request because there's,
there's not much value in making

310
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,460
it better to read or, or like
more efficient to reuse

311
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,800
something

312
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:54,765
because we do have to actually
complete work. Which also really

313
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:55,995
reminds me of when I used to
send poems out to magazines. I'm

314
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,225
like,

315
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:01,785
I know this is still terrible,
but it's time. It's time to send

316
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,346
it out. Um,

317
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,625
Bekah: I found magazine, poetry
magazine editors were the

318
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,520
meanest

319
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,250
people that I have ever met.
They would the meanest

320
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,980
rejections

321
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,510
this. You are personally
attacking me. What is, why, why

322
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,630
did you do that to me?

323
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Mark: I used to, I think the,
the framing of this that I heard

324
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
was

325
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,445
that, um, like poems are never
finished. They're just

326
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,620
abandoned,

327
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,110
like at a certain point and you
have to move on with your life

328
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,730
and start writing the next one.
Um, and so there's so many even

329
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,150
great things that we love that
people have made that you look

330
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,212
back and you just see, these
are, um, you know, The things

331
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:46,274
somebody

332
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:49,186
felt anxious about and hated and
thought it was, it's still not

333
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:52,275
finished when they released it.
And like, luckily you don't get

334
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:55,155
to actually experience that when
you read the work.

335
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:56,035
Bekah: Yeah.

336
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,280
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I think
that's true. And I, I mean, you

337
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,629
were

338
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,610
saying this, but I think that's
true of pretty much anything you

339
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,711
can create. Right. I mean, you
can try to improve things

340
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:10,433
forever, you know? And, um, I've
heard that advice. You know,

341
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,155
from

342
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:16,125
a lot of other people too, is
especially, uh, when it comes to

343
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,745
maybe blogging, things like
that. Right. It's like, just get

344
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,274
it out

345
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,820
there, you know, and then you
can always improve it if you

346
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,365
want to

347
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:25,396
later, um, you know, Jono was on
talking about the, um, was it

348
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,706
the

349
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:31,995
digital garden, you know, and,
um, how you can kind of put

350
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,270
something out there even in a
rough draft. I mean, like it's

351
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,545
up

352
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:37,275
to your comfort level, but it's
okay to like put, put things out

353
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,721
there, you know? that aren't
completely perfect because

354
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:43,410
nothing is ever going to be
completely perfect and accepting

355
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,571
that it can be hard for sure.
I've found myself deep in a hole

356
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,490
spending half an afternoon on
something that literally like

357
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,409
has

358
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,850
no effect on the world and
nobody is ever going to notice

359
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,290
or care

360
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,626
if it's better or is, or, you
know, and I'm just like, I know

361
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:57,961
I

362
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,230
could do the, you know, I can
have, I know I can get better. I

363
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,050
know I can like whatever and, it
can be easy, be easy to step

364
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,870
into

365
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,171
that trap.

366
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,631
Mark: Yeah. That's all. It was
the stuff that ends up later on

367
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,131
getting like cut from the
roadmap.

368
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,066
Dan: Yeah. And then that reminds
me, that does, the other thing I

369
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,265
was going to say is, is getting
that poll request. So like,

370
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,464
there

371
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:18,336
is a, there is a, a level of
refinement that you want to wait

372
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,596
until other people maybe have
looked at something first to, to

373
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,185
confirm that it's even going to
stay, that it's even going to be

374
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:29,435
worth like the, uh, the extra
time, you know, if needed or, or

375
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:30,620
even if it's needed, you know?
Um, and most of the time, I

376
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,805
think

377
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:32,661
when a teammate will look at
something, they'll be like,

378
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,516
yeah,

379
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,141
This is good. You know, this is
good enough. Like let's, let's

380
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,570
keep moving. Cause we can put
efforts, you know, in other

381
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,451
places, but it can be hard to
let go sometimes.

382
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,506
Bekah: Yeah. And so, so we're
talking about, you know,

383
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,111
relating

384
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:51,260
all of these different things
from music and writing and

385
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,810
coding. And so you have this
non-traditional background, but

386
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,461
you also, um, done a lot of
work, helping other people from

387
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,770
non-traditional backgrounds
coming into the industry. Um,

388
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,079
can

389
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,610
you just talk a little bit
about, you know, how you've done

390
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,140
that

391
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,691
and maybe share a highlight
story?

392
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:15,945
Mark: Yeah, totally. Um, so for,
for me, Like the thing that

393
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,715
really helped me about this as a
job and change was starting to

394
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:19,485
go

395
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:22,741
to meetups in Atlanta. Um, and
at my first meetup, it was a, it

396
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,996
was

397
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:30,615
a meetup for to think that
pancakes might be about to

398
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:35,895
arrive. No, maybe yes. Unclear.
Okay. We're going to move on.

399
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,695
Bekah: can go check for your
pancakes.

400
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,695
Dan: I are there pancakes for
all of us?

401
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:40,816
Mark: Let's find out.

402
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,296
Bekah: I don't like pancakes.

403
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,086
Dan: You don't like pancakes,

404
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,645
Bekah: like a savory breakfast
person. I usually don't like the

405
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,306
sweet stuff.

406
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,365
Dan: but Bekah,

407
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,675
Bekah: Maybe crepes that are
like stuffed with cream cheese,

408
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,836
filling that I will take those.

409
00:18:58,056 --> 00:18:59,495
Dan: I'd do a savory crepe. A
Crepe I would prefer to be

410
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,934
savory

411
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,296
then than sweet, like a, like a
crepe with like cheese and meat

412
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,461
or something in it, you know,
but like, Pancakes, but Pancake

413
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:08,596
you

414
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,355
can like a pancake on its own if
you make it, unless you're going

415
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,846
crazy yet. It's not very sweet.
Right. And so it's all about how

416
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:16,455
much, like stuff you put on top
of it. Right.

417
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,980
Bekah: it was just like boring.
I don't know.

418
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:19,545
Dan: But I'm saying mix it in
with some of your, some like

419
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:20,895
meat

420
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,205
and eggs and you know, and a
little bit of syrup because you

421
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,695
know, a little bit of sweet with
a savory, you know, like really

422
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,016
like helps everything kinda.

423
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,175
Bekah: Are you telling me to mix
up my pancakes with meat.

424
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:32,401
Dan: not mixed. I mean, I'm
saying eat them on a plate

425
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,591
together. Not, not mixed not
like mixed up next to each other

426
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,721
and

427
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,971
then eat them at the same time
as if it was a meal

428
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:40,746
Mark: they, they,

429
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,361
Dan: with multiple points. Like.

430
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,725
Mark: um, eitherway I have
pancakes now I'm not going to

431
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,134
eat

432
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:48,566
them right next to microphone
though, for, for everyone's

433
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,505
benefit. Um, but, uh, so get
back to this first meetup I went

434
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:54,444
to,

435
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:56,635
is, uh, like

436
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,046
Bekah: Thanks for bringing it
back, Mark. Cause I could've

437
00:19:59,046 --> 00:19:59,226
gone.

438
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,476
Dan: I know I'm already
spiraling on this pancake thing.

439
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,993
Mark: So Yeah. So I. Part of
Free Code Camp was your

440
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:11,760
onboarding and

441
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,110
Free Code Camp. And they tell
you to go join the Facebook

442
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,460
group for

443
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,051
your city. Um, and if there's
not a Facebook group in your

444
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,641
city,

445
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,490
you're supposed to start it. So
it's really good. It was, that

446
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,580
was how it was back then, at
least. Um, I found the Facebook

447
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,545
group for Free Code Camp
Atlanta, and, uh, there were

448
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,510
meeting at a

449
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,361
certain coffee shop at a certain
time. So my first tech meetup, I

450
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,920
was pretty nervous. I didn't
know how to act at a tech

451
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,479
meetup. I

452
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,971
didn't know too many people in
Atlanta yet, or what even

453
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,755
happened there. So I go to the
coffee shop. And I see a group

454
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,539
of

455
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,141
like six or seven people sitting
around a table with laptops and

456
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,865
talking and stuff. And I'm like,
okay, this is obviously the

457
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,589
right

458
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,515
group. And so I walk up and I'm
talking to them for a few

459
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,440
minutes

460
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,510
asking people, what are they
working on? You know, just

461
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,431
they're like, Hey, what are you
doing? I'm learning this and

462
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,941
working on some Java script. And
then at some point I mentioned

463
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:01,451
Free Code Camp and they didn't
know what I was talking about.

464
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:01,726
Bekah: Yeah.

465
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,375
Mark: This was a group of
strangers. Who were just

466
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,750
tolerating me, interrupting
their meeting. And they were

467
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,125
just too

468
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,570
nice to tell me to go away. Um,
and so once we figured it out,

469
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,015
we

470
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,200
had a little bit of a laugh and
I was like, okay, well, the

471
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,384
worst

472
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,996
has happened. This the worse
thing that could possibly happen

473
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,220
with these meetups. So I'm
through that. Um, but what it

474
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,444
was

475
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:30,945
was people were from code for
Atlanta. And so they were like,

476
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:32,340
we're, we're not your meetup
that you came to, but we do run

477
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,704
a

478
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:38,836
different meetup and you should,
you should come to that. I was

479
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:41,175
like, there's no way I'm going
to go to that. I can't live this

480
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:45,316
moment down. Does no, just, uh,
going to stay as far away from

481
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,311
that as I can obviously. And,
uh, so I went over to the other

482
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,306
table

483
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:50,551
where there were just two people
sitting down there that was

484
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:51,796
like,

485
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:55,358
asked a crucial question. Are
you Free Code Camp meet up, um,

486
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,440
and

487
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,615
who was sitting there was
Nerando Johnson and our friend

488
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:02,789
Krista,

489
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:06,060
that's the two people that were
there. And, uh, obviously that

490
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,361
was a life-changing moment for
me, cause me and Nerando and

491
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:12,240
Krista had been friends ever
since, um, and help each other.

492
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,980
So the kindness of everybody at
that meetup and through people

493
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,836
showing up to just like. I
realized that week after week,

494
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:24,496
people were going there who were
not just learning, but also

495
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,776
people who had been through it
and people who had jobs and were

496
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,620
coming back just to hang out and
answer questions and support.

497
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,464
Um,

498
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:34,155
and so I learned so much from
those meetups, having specific

499
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:37,365
people there who could say, oh,
the problem you're having today,

500
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:42,861
the solution is not. Continue
hacking in the bad way that

501
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,345
you're hacking the solution is
you should learn Firebase so

502
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:45,829
that

503
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,191
you can users and have data
stored properly. And that will

504
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:52,070
solve like all of the pain that
you're having, trying to

505
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,941
something weird with cookies or
write to the server in PHP or

506
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,840
whatever. Um, so those moments
were really helpful for me. And

507
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,411
going to, when I actually did
start going to Code for Atlanta,

508
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,431
getting into the hackathons
there, like just improved my

509
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:10,316
confidence and improve my
skills. So having gone through

510
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:13,201
that, I

511
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:17,820
think it's nice to sort of pay
that back when are new in the

512
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,140
industry as well. You always
learn a lot when you're trying

513
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,460
to

514
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:26,310
help people. I vividly remember
the sort of embarrassment and

515
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,040
hesitation that you feel when
you're starting to learn and

516
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,861
trying to convince yourself that
it's possible to switch careers.

517
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:35,358
And, um, it seems ridiculous.
So, uh, Yeah. I like those. I

518
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,855
like

519
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:43,445
doing kind of portfolio reviews,
mock interviews. Um, since I've

520
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:46,685
been on the hiring type a little
bit as well, like those are

521
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,681
really useful. Um, and you get
to know people and, um, kinda

522
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,586
make

523
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,796
connections that stick with you.

524
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:56,965
Bekah: Yeah, That's awesome. And
I think that, like you were

525
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,625
saying about learning Firebase
rather than, than continuing

526
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,655
hacking in a way that doesn't
make sense. That's so hard to

527
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:07,796
figure out if you're learning on
your own, because it just really

528
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,928
depends on what resources.
You've read and how you've

529
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:12,060
understood

530
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,780
things. You know sometimes there
are resources, there are blog

531
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,651
posts out there that are not
giving you the best information.

532
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,951
And so recognizing that like,
Hey, there's a lot written out

533
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:25,230
there. Not everything is going
to you the right ways or the

534
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,509
best

535
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,375
practices and figuring out how
to discern between what is a

536
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,240
good

537
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,711
resource and not can be really,
really tricky. On your own. So

538
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:40,681
that's why meetups like that
are, are awesome.

539
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,516
Dan: Yeah, I would just, I would
also say. This is true, even if

540
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,480
you're not learning, you know,
uh it's you can be very

541
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,444
expensive,

542
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,596
like be developing for a long
time. Uh, but being kind of

543
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:53,681
isolated and it's possible. And
I say, this has, you know,

544
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,766
person

545
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:58,976
who I'm describing myself a
couple of years ago, basically.

546
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:03,175
Uh, but it's, it's like it that
exposure to other people. And

547
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,546
it's just, like mark said, like,
oh, just use Firebase. Like

548
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:07,650
somebody just saying that, and
it doesn't have to. Somebody

549
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,454
who's,

550
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,736
you know, a mentor or somebody
who is teaching or whatever, it

551
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,435
can be somebody who's also just
learning, you know what I mean?

552
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:16,310
But that, those, uh, that, that
exposure to other people who

553
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,185
are,

554
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,766
who are doing the same sorts of
things as you are, it's, it's so

555
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:24,695
important. And so, and, and
useful, uh, just even on a, on a

556
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:28,296
like tactical level, you know
what I mean? It just, it just

557
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:30,723
like makes you better. Um,
osmosis, you know, even if

558
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:33,150
you're

559
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,721
not like, uh, actively doing
talks or doing, you know, act

560
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:37,591
that, you know, whatever,
whatever, just like that

561
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:38,461
exposure

562
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:39,871
to people. Um,

563
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:42,935
Mark: Yeah. and you could go to
that group and just kinda hang

564
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,395
out, um, kind of like the
coworking room and Virtual

565
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:49,266
Coffee, where, uh, sometimes I
went to that meetup and I really

566
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:53,586
didn't say anything to anybody
because I was, um, some jobs. I

567
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:56,915
would usually get there after
work and have like some goal. I

568
00:25:56,915 --> 00:25:58,700
was like, I need to do this. And
for some reason, being around

569
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,485
all

570
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:03,195
these people, even if they're
really busily talking. It gives

571
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,925
me enough energy to actually
spend two or three hours coding

572
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:09,915
do the thing I came to do. Um,
versus if I went home, I would

573
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:14,266
just be like, I'm tired after
work not have that energy from

574
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:14,955
those people.

575
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,701
Dan: Yeah, it totally. And the
other, the other part is, I

576
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,576
mean,

577
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,786
the other benefit of a small
group like that, especially in

578
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:26,215
person wants, which I know is
like very, very hard right now,

579
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:29,635
but, um, uh, you know, it's the
kind of thing we're trying to

580
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:34,026
recapture at least in Virtual
Coffee. Um, but. You know, you,

581
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,685
you can get exposure in on
Twitter, like by following a

582
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:37,780
whole bunch of people. Right.
But you never know exactly

583
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,875
what's

584
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,210
going to happen. And if you
don't know the people, then your

585
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,545
last

586
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,826
time following people that other
people, you know, based on

587
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,586
numbers and based on what
Twitter's algorithm kind of

588
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:50,576
pushes in front of you and you,
again, you, can't always, you

589
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:54,536
can't always know, uh, exactly
like who people are or whether

590
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,566
you can trust their information
and stuff like that. And, um,

591
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,101
when you're in a group of just
people. Uh, as a small group,

592
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:06,721
it's much more there's no, like
he can't tell how many people

593
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:07,936
follow, like follow that person.
You know, everyone's just

594
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,151
sitting

595
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,941
in a room together. There's
nobody has like a, you know,

596
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,340
inherent value with air quotes
is value, you know, uh, bigger

597
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,739
than

598
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,840
another person, you know, and
one person has 20 followers on

599
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,260
Twitter. Another has, you know,
10,000, but when they're in just

600
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,790
the room together, talking to
them, Sort of everybody's more

601
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,320
on

602
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:29,250
a similar level, um, think
improves communication. Yeah.

603
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,861
Mark: And I remember seeing
Krista who is fantastic and was

604
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,991
kind of years ahead of me in her
development and like being

605
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:37,121
along,

606
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:40,190
learning. And seeing her,
knowing that she knows more than

607
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,259
me and

608
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,290
is really good at what she does.
And when somebody would bring up

609
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,360
a topic that hadn't run into
yet, she would just ask the

610
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,430
question

611
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:52,381
and she'd be like, oh, I don't
know what that is. Tell me about

612
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:56,551
it and not feel the need to
like, um, I don't know, pretend

613
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:00,721
that,

614
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,311
you know, everything or like
show off people aren't going

615
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,901
there to

616
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,201
show off. People are going there
to like, Um, and so seeing

617
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,951
somebody that I know is better
than me still comfortable, I'm

618
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,571
like, oh, maybe this is why
better than me. Like, this is

619
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,191
how

620
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,641
you get good, is you keep asking
questions and you don't try to

621
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:24,211
bluff. and, and like use, use
your curiosity to drive you. Um,

622
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,181
so I do some of those moments
kind of stood out to me that I

623
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:29,520
think you can only witness when
you're in a group and see a

624
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,451
dynamic, um, and see different
people handling situations in

625
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:35,678
different ways. So Yeah. whether
it's a virtual group or not,

626
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,905
but,

627
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,385
um, it's nice that we have these
to other people.

628
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,185
Bekah: Yeah, I think when you
have that exposure, it allows

629
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:45,860
you

630
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:49,080
to build some sort of
relationship of trust and

631
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:53,490
understanding, and there's more
of a comfort level. So there's a

632
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,701
built-in credibility almost. And
so can feel free to free or to

633
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:04,740
ask questions in some situations
to not like even people that I

634
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,570
know from Virtual Coffee, I'm
not a big, um, YouTube tutorial

635
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,010
watcher, but if I know somebody
from Virtual Coffee or if I've

636
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,070
met them in real life, it's
easier for me to watch their

637
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,790
videos. I think because it's
like, okay, yeah, this is, is my

638
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,100
friend. And I know they know
what they're talking about or I

639
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,410
know

640
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:27,901
that this person talks about
this, so I'm going to go watch

641
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:30,286
their video. And so it, it
allows for that. I don't know,

642
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:32,671
like, um,

643
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,855
a step towards trusting that
they will be a good resource for

644
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:39,390
you.

645
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,441
Um, so now that experience with
Code for Atlanta was not your

646
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,701
last experience with them,
right?

647
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:51,631
Mark: No, no. So this is good.
This and this ties into another

648
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:56,580
thing. That I try to communicate
to new developers, um, which is

649
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,490
how to put things on your resume
that are like closer to

650
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,650
professional work. Then even
solo projects you do on your

651
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,810
own. And

652
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,320
for me, Code for Atlanta had a
headache connection for me

653
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,401
because they were running a
hackathon series with Marta is

654
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:18,570
Atlanta's transit agency and
working at people, making

655
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,310
progress, which I'm still
connected with. Uh, I was

656
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,050
working

657
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,530
as a job coach and running
supported employment programs

658
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,090
where people would use the, um,
Marta Mobility Service to get

659
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,300
from home to work. So an example
is somebody with down syndrome

660
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,201
who works bagging groceries, or
somebody who's working in a dish

661
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,810
room or something that we use to
support with schedule these

662
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,401
rides. The bus takes you door to
door. Um, but scheduling and

663
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:47,191
everything around scheduling was
done over the phone, which is

664
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,891
pretty difficult for people with
cognitive impairments or speech

665
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,131
impediments, like challenges
around judgment when you're

666
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:57,330
sitting in a phone queue. So I
had a lot of experience of the

667
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,721
pain of working with Marta and
Atlanta Code for Atlanta was

668
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:05,621
running these events. And I saw
it as my chance to like talk to

669
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:09,840
MARTA. Not on the phone, but be
in their face and say, Hey,

670
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,080
here's a, here's a lot of stuff
that's happening on the phone

671
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,280
that probably could be happening
through the website or something

672
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,010
like that. And the hack my
proposal for the hackathon was

673
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,671
here's a better way to handle
like booking and canceling rides

674
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:27,300
and keeping people informed of
when the van is coming. 'Cause

675
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,240
they have a 30 minute window and
sometimes it's Atlanta, there's

676
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,605
always traffic. Sometimes the
bus can be an hour late, be an

677
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:32,970
hour

678
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:37,050
and a half late, but if you're
waiting for it, and they come,

679
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,415
you only have five minutes to
get to the bus before they move

680
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,750
on.

681
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,250
So people would just stand
outside for as long as it takes

682
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,000
the hot and the cold and the
rain, whether they have to pee

683
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,810
bad situation for people to just
be waiting without knowing how

684
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,621
long the bus comes. And I could
get more into the weeds of that

685
00:31:55,621 --> 00:32:00,705
problem, but that's the general
idea and the solution, because I

686
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:03,645
knew when I would call on behalf
of somebody and I would pick up

687
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:07,935
the phone and say, Hey, when is
Kevin's bus going to get here? I

688
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:11,236
could feel that that person was
just clicking on a computer and

689
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:12,906
reading a line off of the sheet
and telling me what the time

690
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,576
said

691
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:19,006
at like that field of the
estimated time of arrival, which

692
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,080
I could just publish that time
on the website, we could read

693
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,485
that

694
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:24,286
ourselves and we wouldn't have
to tie up the phones all the

695
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:26,086
time

696
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:28,882
asking about the late buses. So,
um, I went to the hackathon

697
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,559
there

698
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,050
and, uh, met some people. I
think I really wanted to go to

699
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,300
the

700
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
hackathon because in CS 50, they
explained what a hackathon is.

701
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,601
And I was like, I want to have
that 24 hour experience of like,

702
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:46,320
seeing what it's like to do it.
Um, Nerando came along for that

703
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
hackathon and we met two other
people just chatting beforehand,

704
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,421
who became the team. I learned
about, uh, how to turn like that

705
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:57,316
idea into a kind of app
solution. So we had somebody who

706
00:32:57,316 --> 00:33:00,211
knew about

707
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,020
iOS. He worked on actually
building out an iOS app based on

708
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,475
some wire frames that we made
and some wishlists I had of what

709
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,930
we

710
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,901
would be able to do. Um, and
that a three-part event. we

711
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,871
actually

712
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:16,770
had two more cracks at this. We
convinced MARTA to provide some

713
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,730
data to us about the disability
support service they had, this

714
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,550
was not a part of the hackathon
dataset. This was like,

715
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,095
something, we were bringing in
that we wanted to work on. Um,

716
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:29,130
we

717
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:31,560
worked with them for awhile. We
made a pilot for them that they

718
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,641
actually used for a few weeks.
And as it turned out, they were

719
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,425
separately in negotiations to
buy something that did some

720
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,090
similar

721
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,270
stuff. So on the one hand it was
a bummer. We didn't get to like

722
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,780
really ship our code. We were
able to get into meetings with

723
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,560
the third party provider who
they were using to provide this

724
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,560
service and give them early
feedback on what their product

725
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,740
did or didn't do that would be
useful for the population we

726
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,215
wanted it to help. So, um, it
got us like in the room for

727
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:00,690
those

728
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,941
types of conversations and it,
let me put MARTA on my resume as

729
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,220
like I did a project with MARTA.
not saying it was a paid

730
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,440
project.

731
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,860
Not saying I was a consultant or
anything, but here's a project

732
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,721
with an organization that you've
heard of in your city, um, that

733
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:21,585
is different to my calculator
that's on code pen. is homework

734
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:26,686
from Free Code Camp and like
using civic tech to connect with

735
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,831
nonprofits or other
organizations that you can do

736
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:30,976
work for so that

737
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:34,545
you have something people have
heard of on your resume that

738
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,030
you've contributed to. Maybe you
had requirements, you worked

739
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,515
with

740
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:41,506
a team, all this like benefits
of adding to your resume beyond

741
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:45,496
a

742
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:48,976
project you came up with on your
own, really strengthened that.

743
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:52,755
And let me talk about something
different in interviews. So I

744
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,621
really believe like my purpose
is Code for Atlanta now is not

745
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:58,456
so

746
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:01,786
much to support any specific
project, but to like support

747
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:04,365
people, building their resumes,
who are new to the industry and

748
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:08,235
have worked for them to do, uh,
that's kind of what motivates me

749
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:11,005
to stay involved and spend some
time like helping to organize

750
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,626
things I'm able to do that.

751
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,105
Bekah: I love that. And I think,
you know, we hear a lot of

752
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,680
advice

753
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,601
to early career folks to, you
know, get into open source and

754
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:26,110
that's a good way to build your
resume, I liked this idea of

755
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,885
civic tech. Because it seems
like be a more intimate group of

756
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:36,746
people communicating together.
Whereas you almost feel a lot of

757
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:41,186
open source contributions. Like
you're an outsider coming in and

758
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:45,291
if you need help, it's harder.
Ask because there's not clear

759
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,010
paths of communication or, or
whatever, but you're working on

760
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,521
something that's mission driven
and that has a team of people

761
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:54,740
that need to communicate, those
are certainly all skills that

762
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,959
can

763
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,285
be utilizing and kind of
building your own team. Right.

764
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:01,610
So if

765
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,820
you're involved in a community
like code camp or code for

766
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,150
Atlanta Virtual Coffee or
whatever, You can turn to people

767
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,351
and say like, look, there's a
nonprofit in my hometown. And

768
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:14,453
they could really use some help.
I'd love to. Ask them, if I

769
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,555
could

770
00:36:16,556 --> 00:36:19,585
work on a project for them, but
I could use some support, is

771
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:23,215
anybody else interested? And I
think that's a really great way

772
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,425
to show, like, look, you are
taking initiative, you are

773
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:31,766
working on a project and that is
not a calculator or, you know, a

774
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:34,361
to-do list app and really,
really kind of own the project

775
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,956
yourself

776
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:41,576
is, is a great way to showcase
you can do to learn a lot pretty

777
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,851
quickly. Um, and yeah, to have
something on your resume.

778
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:48,295
Mark: Yeah, and Nerando will be
annoyed if I don't mention this.

779
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,416
Cause I do sometimes forget to
mention this, that project

780
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:55,436
extended into a different, uh,
event. That was a civic tech

781
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,968
challenge. That was run by GE
and AT&T. And so our team kind

782
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:02,471
of re

783
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,081
rebuilt the project, added some
smart city integration because

784
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,681
it

785
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,625
was a smart city thing. Um, and
we won a $40,000 prize, Uh,

786
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,569
which

787
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,130
we didn't expect to win. So we
had all signed in advance that

788
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,690
we

789
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,715
agreed to donate this to charity
because we thought maybe we

790
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:20,740
would

791
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,590
come in third or whatever. So
like, um, it's. uh, I think it's

792
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,701
a better story that we gave away
when we were all broke. This is

793
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,311
the thing, like we were not, we
didn't have jobs yet as

794
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:37,751
developers. Um, but we agreed
that so many people had

795
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:40,960
contributed to this, that it
would be kind of unfair for just

796
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,800
the, the six people on the team
at the time of that competition

797
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,410
to walk away with the money, um,
because it was a long project.

798
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,020
20

799
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,881
30 people who did something on
it. Um, so we all felt good

800
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:54,971
about

801
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:56,771
that. And we thought maybe we
would come in third, which was

802
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:59,305
like five grand, not too much.
Um, but you get involved in

803
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:01,839
stuff

804
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,690
like this, it does have
potential. This won't happen to

805
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,940
everybody. It has potential to
snowball into a weird side

806
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,190
effect

807
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,510
of like donating more to
charity. Then you make it a

808
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,830
year. So, uh,

809
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,800
uh, that was good. That was a
good thing that we did and I

810
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,410
still stand by it. But, um,
Yeah. I, I also was wierd if I

811
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,020
forget

812
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,541
to finish the story with that
detail.

813
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:29,885
Dan: Yeah, no, he was, he, uh,
he might've mentioned that when

814
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:31,115
he

815
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:35,706
was on the podcast as well. I
think he pretty much felt the

816
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:40,246
same way as you like. Well, I'm
glad we did it... but also...

817
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,831
Mark: Well, the thing, the thing
I like about it is when that's

818
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:48,280
the outcome of a project, it
doesn't matter that like MARTA

819
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,061
didn't use our prototype. We got
money to charities that serve

820
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,471
people with disabilities, which
enables them to increase their

821
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,211
mission and have impact. And
like I, because I worked at one

822
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,951
of

823
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,463
those charities, I know what
that money is spent on. So

824
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:04,975
through the

825
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,956
channel of civic tech, if you
are able to enter and win prizes

826
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,936
and

827
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:12,835
donate prizes, have this other
way of making impact. That's

828
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:15,475
actually probably a little bit
more effective than on any

829
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:18,115
single

830
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,755
project to really take off and
be implemented. It's like a lot

831
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:23,395
of

832
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:26,920
the work in civic tech. If it's
not tightly integrated with an

833
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:29,771
actual organization or a
nonprofit is more like proof of

834
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:31,196
concepts. Here's how you could
do your government. Here's how

835
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:32,621
you

836
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,280
could do your MARTA mobility
service. And it shows the way to

837
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,860
something, but it might not be,
um, it might not be the

838
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,440
technical

839
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,110
solution that actually gets
implemented, but if it gets the

840
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,245
conversation going or you raise
some money with it, like that's

841
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,380
a

842
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,880
valuable output, or if it helps
someone get a job, that's a

843
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,065
valuable output for um, the
activity of civic tech that can

844
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,686
sometimes seem like it goes
nowhere.

845
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:03,358
Dan: Yeah, I love that, you
know, and it's is, uh, Like

846
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,160
Bekah was

847
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,800
saying. Yeah. Some people, you
know, it's a little easier to

848
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,405
conceive of going into, trying
to contribute to open source,

849
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:11,950
um,

850
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:13,946
stuff like that, but that it's
civic tech is it's a little

851
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:15,911
more,

852
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,555
um, so what I was gonna say was
it is a little more, um,

853
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:19,150
nebulous

854
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,910
in my mind, if you, excuse me,
if you were, if a developer was

855
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,670
like

856
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,221
one or two, start getting
involved in this in maybe they

857
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,276
don't live in Atlanta, uh, like
where, where would I look like

858
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:31,331
if

859
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:34,300
I want to. Maybe, you know, try
to get involved in civic tech a

860
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,295
little bit more in Cleveland.
Um, for instance, like, should I

861
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:38,290
just

862
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,661
Google civic tech, Cleveland and
see what comes up or is there

863
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,570
other like specific places, you
know, that you might look first?

864
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:44,685
Like what, what can we do to,
you know, if somebody wants to

865
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:45,709
do

866
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:45,800
this.

867
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,001
Mark: Within the US, there's
definitely Code for America is

868
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,635
like the umbrella organization.
And Code for America itself is a

869
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:58,916
nonprofit that, um, specific
projects and has employees and

870
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,956
often works with local
governments and organizations

871
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:05,996
like that, but it also supports
the brigade network, which is,

872
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:09,596
um, all around the U S there's
there's many Brigades, I forget

873
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:12,340
how many, but most states have
at least one. Um, you can find

874
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,084
your

875
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:19,016
local project from there. And
there are, there are also civic

876
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:22,661
tech communities around the
world. Um, so I guess I'll have

877
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:27,010
to look up the address for that
and we can it somewhere. Um,

878
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,480
yeah, but I know there are
communities in Ireland, there

879
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,410
are

880
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:33,010
communities, um, kind of all
around that are United by the

881
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,090
sort of social good impact tech
work. Um, people consider the

882
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,515
actual details of what's
important to focus on

883
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:42,940
differently

884
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,666
in those communities, depending
on kind of what their mission

885
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,331
is.

886
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:49,323
Um, obviously my point of view
is like helping people get

887
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,835
exposure.

888
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,775
Um, very much I'm focused on the
non-profit side of things, not

889
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:55,654
as

890
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:58,140
much on the interfacing with
government entities. but so

891
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,625
there

892
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,351
are different roles. You can see
a typical civic tech

893
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:04,076
organization

894
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:10,811
having, um, but it's, uh, it's
really nice when. Most of the

895
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:14,710
time, there is plenty of people
to do the work. And there's also

896
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,390
plenty of projects happening at
once. So you can come in and

897
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,070
find

898
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,170
something where you can either
learn or you can participate.

899
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,270
Um,

900
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:25,481
and the kind of people who do
these things tend to be of the

901
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,661
helpful variety. Like whoever's
giving up a Tuesday night to go

902
00:42:28,661 --> 00:42:30,266
and work for free for a
nonprofit they never heard of.

903
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:31,871
They're

904
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:35,740
probably nice enough to help you
set up git do things like.

905
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:36,496
Dan: Yeah.

906
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:38,455
Mark: This is where I learned
how to use git properly. It's

907
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,715
where I

908
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:43,556
learned how to install packages.
Like just real basic stuff. Came

909
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:46,826
from Code for Atlanta people
helping me there.

910
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:52,226
Bekah: I just want to follow
that up and say that when you're

911
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,026
working on you don't have to
work on a time intensive

912
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:55,826
project.

913
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:56,996
Right. So I know, you know,
there are people that are

914
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,166
learning who

915
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,465
have jobs and kids or other
responsibilities, and they might

916
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:04,525
say like, wow, that's just not
doable. But I think that, you

917
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:06,490
know, there are so many
different options out there and,

918
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,455
know, one,

919
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:13,405
if you're working on a three-day
project. are going to learn so

920
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:16,315
much in those three days it
might be more than weeks worth

921
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:19,225
of work

922
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:22,885
that you were learning by
yourself. And so, ya know, kind

923
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:26,306
of thinking about the benefits
or, you know, look at a longer

924
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:27,760
project, start something
yourself with other people and

925
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,214
say like,

926
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,335
we're going to do this over a
period of six weeks and then

927
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:35,726
evaluate where we are and it's
going to be five hours a week or

928
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:39,835
whatever, you know, it doesn't
it work for you, but those

929
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,615
experiences are invaluable as
you're making your way into the

930
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:44,425
tech industry.

931
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:47,780
Mark: Totally. And I agree it
can be slow. Our, um, our MARTA

932
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,075
thing

933
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:54,635
went on for about a year, maybe
more. Um, a lot of it is really

934
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,940
incremental. Some of the
projects I worked on only did

935
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,245
anything

936
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:03,655
twice a month at the civic hack
night. So I would work really

937
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:05,110
hard to prepare for a civic hack
night because I would have

938
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,565
people

939
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:09,056
who wanted to come and work on
something like Free Live

940
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:11,335
Transcript.com that you guys
have seen. Um, so a lot of the

941
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:13,614
work

942
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:16,465
that's on that now came from a
civic hack night where I have

943
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:20,005
like two hours of people I'm
going to try to explain how the

944
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:22,795
whole project works in the first
few minutes and then figure out

945
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:24,100
what everybody's good at and
what they want to do. And come

946
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,405
up with

947
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:30,476
tasks and get them assigned out
and like check on them. And

948
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:33,025
sometimes that works beautifully
and sometimes it's hard to get

949
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,416
people going because the, the
code is pretty ugly in there.

950
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:38,396
And, uh, you need a certain
level of experience to, uh, undo

951
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,376
what I

952
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:45,235
did when I wrote that project.
But like, uh, sometimes it is

953
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,365
effective and you can get eight
hours of work done by four

954
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,495
people

955
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,016
in a two hour period, which
really moves the project

956
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,536
forward.

957
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:56,876
Um, and now four people know how
to work on it. And one of them

958
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:59,335
might have like a bee in their
bonnet and want to come back and

959
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:00,790
fix it the next time. Or
sometimes they just drift off.

960
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,245
It

961
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:03,970
doesn't matter. They
contributed, they got something

962
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,694
out of it. Um,

963
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:10,945
I kind of liken it to being an a
band in college where sometimes

964
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:13,142
most people would show up to
practice. And like you're

965
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:15,339
relying

966
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,880
on volunteers. Your expectations
should be that things are going

967
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,200
to be slow and every now and
then a hackathon will come and

968
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,520
they'll

969
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,490
be really fast for a few days,
but mostly you will try to set

970
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,459
up

971
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,911
your tickets and try to set up
your list of tasks to be like,

972
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:34,931
anybody can pick this up. And
nothing's too big or too small

973
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:38,291
for someone to take a crack at
it at a hack night. And even the

974
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,271
smallest ticket is really
meaningful. If it's someone's

975
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,420
first pull request, um, that
they've made to an open source

976
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,690
project or something like that.
So fixing a spelling mistake or

977
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,090
whatever, um, can be like, Hey,
so my first time forking a repo

978
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,311
and contributing to open source,
just like we're doing what heck

979
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:56,290
over Fest at this moment in
time. Uh, those do that does

980
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,209
kind of

981
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,221
the mystery of how to do that.

982
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:06,175
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I think
that any step forward the

983
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:11,005
momentum. Right? And so if you a
typo or something small, then

984
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:13,645
it's still moving you forward
and getting you ready for the

985
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,845
next

986
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:19,746
time you create a pull request
and feeling a little bit more

987
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:22,445
confident as you do that. So I
don't think that we should

988
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:25,390
diminish any contributions. It's
good to get started and to get

989
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,915
in

990
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:28,215
there.

991
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,510
Dan: Yeah, and I mean, this is
something we talk about a lot

992
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,021
with Virtual Coffee. It is hard
to get into opensource. You

993
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,501
know,

994
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,581
it's, there's a lot of, uh, uh,
and this is true. I'm sure of

995
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:42,460
civic tech just opens doors in
general. Right? There's, there's

996
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,431
a bunch of things to learn, you
know? And so honestly, if you're

997
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:50,081
doing something that is maybe a
small contribution to the code

998
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:53,110
itself, like fixing the, a typo,
um, then it frees you up to

999
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,621
actually just concert and
learning about, get or learning

1000
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,981
about pull requests, learning
about, uh, that process, uh,

1001
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:03,416
without trying to learn a
mountain of coding stuff at the

1002
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,916
same time. Right. And, you know,
it's a great way to, I like,

1003
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,416
it's

1004
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,305
a, I think that's the best way
to get started in, um, you know,

1005
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,194
and

1006
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:11,290
get in contribute and, you know,
open source, things like that

1007
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,385
is,

1008
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:14,875
is do, uh, you know, small,
small contributions where you're

1009
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,365
not

1010
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:19,735
overshooting, you know, you're
not biting off a big chunk of

1011
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:24,385
something um, code-wise to start
because then you can just

1012
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:26,126
concentrate on the one thing,
learning one thing at a time.

1013
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,200
Mark: I'm really struck by how,
working in the industry for,

1014
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,750
four

1015
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,791
or five years now or whatever it
is. Um, you're only using a tiny

1016
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:44,501
slice of your programming
knowledge at a time. Um, to all

1017
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:46,601
that you have learned already,
you're still on using a tiny

1018
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:49,240
amount of that. And relative to
all the stuff you could learn,

1019
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,820
that's so scary when you're
getting started, you're like

1020
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,471
using a little dot of knowledge.
like, I work in a Vue code base

1021
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:01,751
and I use Tailwind for CSS and I
do certain things that like, um,

1022
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:07,900
are their own little bubble and
have their own documentation. it

1023
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,150
doesn't matter that I even know
PHP from before. Um, I'm not

1024
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,425
using it. I guess I learned
something from learning that,

1025
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,700
but

1026
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:18,686
like, When you actually see
projects and action and talk to

1027
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:20,071
the people they're like, Hey,
you can contribute. And here's

1028
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,456
the

1029
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:23,111
tiny area that you need to know
about. Like, you need to know

1030
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,746
how

1031
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:29,396
to, how to, how to extract this
thing from a loop and JavaScript

1032
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:32,096
and make it more efficient. And
here's the tiny piece of

1033
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:34,916
documentation that will help you
do that. And then ask me if you

1034
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,765
need help, like that reveals
that we're still focused on just

1035
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:40,614
like

1036
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:43,765
really small areas of the
overall practice of programming,

1037
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:45,895
um, at

1038
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:49,525
any given moment on any given
ticket, we're not using the a

1039
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,115
hundred things that we could
know about.

1040
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:55,050
Dan: Yeah. I, I mean, absolutely
agree with that. And I think

1041
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,220
that's actually another benefit
of getting involved in a

1042
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,390
project,

1043
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:58,756
like a civic hacking project
where somebody else, you know,

1044
00:48:58,756 --> 00:49:00,121
if

1045
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,695
somebody, if you have somebody
like Mark who was sort of

1046
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,240
running

1047
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,995
the project, right. And you
join, um, as, uh, somebody who

1048
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:06,750
is

1049
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:11,335
learning, um, you know, you can
be provided. One of the

1050
00:49:11,335 --> 00:49:14,065
challenges of learning when
you're learning is that cloud of

1051
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:16,916
there's a huge amount of things
that you could learn, right? So

1052
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,190
if you go to something like
this, I want to contribute like

1053
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,464
you

1054
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:24,056
now, now you have, um, the thing
to do set in front of you, and

1055
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:25,046
maybe you can just concentrate
on learning just that one thing,

1056
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,036
you

1057
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:29,726
know, and it removes the choice,
uh, which, and then maybe you'll

1058
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:32,635
find it they'll figure out,
well, I hate this. I don't like

1059
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,306
JavaScript or something, or I
don't like something and you can

1060
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,868
move on, you know, it, um, but
the. That's just another,

1061
00:49:37,868 --> 00:49:40,430
another

1062
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:43,311
benefit of get involved with
groups like this, especially a

1063
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:45,381
civic hacking group that is
going to have projects like it's

1064
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:47,451
going

1065
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,341
to have work to do, you know,
and, and, and help, um, doing

1066
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:51,231
it.

1067
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,615
Uh, that's my, like my, my go-to
advice for learning is just

1068
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,850
like,

1069
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:57,650
make, do a project, just do
something, you know, and

1070
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:02,036
Obviously better, but it can't
be bad advice. Cause like, well,

1071
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:03,611
what do I do then, Dan? And then
I'm like, well, I don't know

1072
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:05,186
that

1073
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,565
this is like something that
provides that,

1074
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,431
Mark: And I'll say as well, it,
it provided me with leadership

1075
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,230
experience. I did not go in
wanting to run the project. I

1076
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,029
was

1077
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,516
like, so if I have an idea, Do I
also have to run it and they're

1078
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:23,626
like, Yeah, you have to do, if
its your idea, you pitch it and

1079
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:27,115
you own it. will get join your
team. Um, I was like, okay,

1080
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:30,595
I'll,

1081
00:50:30,706 --> 00:50:33,565
I'll learn how to pitch a
project. And I would be very

1082
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:38,786
nervous at first. And, um, I got
feedback one night from somebody

1083
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,726
who was like part of the local
Toastmasters or something,

1084
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:43,405
happened to be there.

1085
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:45,306
Bekah: it's a recurring theme
here, toastmasters.

1086
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:46,570
Dan: Yeah, it was, was it Gant?

1087
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:51,226
Mark: I don't know, but it was
just like, uh, he, offered take

1088
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:52,861
notes on me pitching and give me
like he had three or four

1089
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:54,496
points.

1090
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:55,815
He's like, you move way too
much. Your, your idea is good

1091
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:57,134
and your

1092
00:50:57,135 --> 00:50:59,476
communications clear, but you
speak too softly and you're

1093
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,335
swaying and it's distracting,
but here's the good things, you

1094
00:51:01,335 --> 00:51:03,194
know,

1095
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,746
and that was a, you don't have
to remember much advice to be

1096
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:08,266
like,

1097
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,440
okay, I'm going to move less.
Um, and try to slow down a

1098
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,585
little.

1099
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:17,996
Uh, uh, just from being at a
hack night happening to run into

1100
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:20,516
people who are experienced,
looking at how you're doing when

1101
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:24,565
you speak. Um, so a lot of
benefits for me, random

1102
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:26,605
unpredictable benefits from
being involved in Code for

1103
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:27,924
Atlanta.

1104
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:31,081
Bekah: When I want to follow up
on that too, and say that that's

1105
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:34,501
a skillset, right. That you're
learning. Not everybody can

1106
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:38,920
pitch. It's not a natural thing.
I, well, maybe for some people

1107
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,041
it's a natural thing that you're
born with, but a lot of us, it's

1108
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:45,760
a skill that we need to work on
and get evaluation. And mean, it

1109
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,101
goes right along with
interviewing, right? Because you

1110
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:50,321
are essentially pitching
yourself and if you're using the

1111
00:51:50,321 --> 00:51:52,541
wrong

1112
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:56,545
tone, I will never forget. I
think I was 11 years old. It was

1113
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:58,285
my first science fair project.
And the highest you could get

1114
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,025
was

1115
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:01,840
a superior. I got an excellent
and I was like very upset with

1116
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,655
my

1117
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:06,506
excellent and the feedback I got
was, um, inappropriate

1118
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:09,326
inflection

1119
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,565
at the end of sentences. Right.
So what that means is when I

1120
00:52:12,565 --> 00:52:16,016
talked, I would talk and, and
like, it was a question than

1121
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:20,820
actually saying what. Actually
knew about the project, And so

1122
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,360
there, you lose credibility. And
I worked very hard to not do

1123
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,210
that

1124
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,760
anymore, but that feedback has
allowed me to grow as a speaker

1125
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,365
and be more deliberate and think
through how I'm doing things

1126
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:37,970
and.

1127
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:42,175
So maybe your tone is wrong when
you're interviewing and you're

1128
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:46,826
not coming off as credible, or
maybe you're not completing your

1129
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:48,496
sentences. There there've been
times in my life where would

1130
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,166
just

1131
00:52:50,186 --> 00:52:53,576
start a sentence and then would
get overwhelmed with people

1132
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:57,206
looking at me and I would just
stop. There was no end to that

1133
00:52:57,206 --> 00:53:01,436
sentence. And usually I ended it
with, so, and that was to me.

1134
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:07,240
didn't know where go from there.
It's something that I have to

1135
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,130
think about still even, you
know, if I'm in a situation

1136
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,020
where I

1137
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,021
suddenly get uncomfortable, like
don't end your sentence with, so

1138
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,251
it's a complete

1139
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,311
Mark: implies that you're going
to keep speaking. So it actually

1140
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:20,650
makes it take even longer for
people to realize that you've

1141
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,251
stopped.

1142
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:25,581
Bekah: Just like once someone to
pick it up for me. So who

1143
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:30,666
Dan: I've never done anything
like that, except for every

1144
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,806
single podcast episode.

1145
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,010
Mark: Oh yeah. But But's another
one. Sometimes I'll be like, so

1146
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,661
yeah, that's it. But, uh,

1147
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:41,030
Bekah: Yes. Yes. 100% do that.

1148
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:42,283
Dan: Well, you probably looked
through the transcripts and

1149
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:43,195
just,

1150
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,376
just see all the times I've done
that. even on the podcast.

1151
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,271
Mark: I'm very self-conscious
about how much I may have done

1152
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:49,260
that in the last hour.

1153
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:50,635
Dan: Oh,

1154
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,420
Mark: We'll find out.

1155
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:58,451
Dan: Yeah, we have a, um, we're
using, uh, what's it called, uh,

1156
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:01,601
Descript now for, uh, podcast
editing, which is a really cool

1157
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:03,145
tool. But one of the things it
does is highlights, filler

1158
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:04,689
words.

1159
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,041
And like, I don't like there, we
could just remove them all or

1160
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,166
something, you know? I mean, I,
I know that there, I'm sure

1161
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,291
there's

1162
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:15,731
some podcasts that will do that
or whatever. Um, I don't do that

1163
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,641
both because it is
time-consuming, but also I, you

1164
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:21,731
know, is pretty, it's a pretty
chill, you know, podcasts in

1165
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:25,840
general, but it does highlight
all of them. And I can see them

1166
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,751
in my, you know, in the
transcripts for my, uh,

1167
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:30,101
paragraphs of talking it's.

1168
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,400
Mark: Published a stats Dan.
Don't keep this from the people.

1169
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:38,561
Dan: I don't think I'm going to
do that. It'd be too

1170
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:40,361
embarrassing, but I'll do it
for, maybe I'll do it for just

1171
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,161
this

1172
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:42,731
episode.

1173
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:45,615
Bekah: But we have transcripts
available for every episode. So

1174
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,295
if somebody would like to just
go do a control, find, you will

1175
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,975
know

1176
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:51,466
how many ums we have had in
every episode, you can publish

1177
00:54:51,466 --> 00:54:53,956
it for

1178
00:54:53,956 --> 00:55:00,666
us. Well, I think we're about at
time Mark. This was really great

1179
00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:04,565
to hear about civic tech. I
actually am really excited to go

1180
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:07,135
find some civic tech projects
and think about how I can

1181
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:09,674
involved in

1182
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:13,775
this more, is there any last
piece of advice you have for

1183
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:14,416
listeners?

1184
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:20,775
Mark: Em, I think that it's.
It's natural to not be sure if

1185
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:25,005
we're

1186
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:26,415
talking to listeners
specifically who are learning

1187
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:27,825
development,

1188
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:29,671
which is not everybody like in
the Virtual Coffee Community.

1189
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:31,516
Um,

1190
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:35,896
but like I remember so much
hesitation and, and not being

1191
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:38,775
sure that this was the right
thing or it was gonna work out,

1192
00:55:39,405 --> 00:55:43,775
um, that does not mean that it's
not the right thing or it's not

1193
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:47,706
going to work out. So I would
suggest people find some way to

1194
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:49,776
live with that feeling. It may
well be there for many years

1195
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:51,846
into

1196
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:54,965
your career for a lot of us.
and, uh, it's just not a very

1197
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:58,084
useful

1198
00:55:58,085 --> 00:56:01,956
feeling. So, uh, I would
encourage people to let it be

1199
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:05,405
and, uh, keep working regardless
and don't pay any mind to the

1200
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:08,166
part of you that's saying that,
uh, cause it's not going to help

1201
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,333
you learn and, uh, Obviously
from the amount of people who

1202
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,500
have

1203
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,360
come through the same journey,
these people that are going on,

1204
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:16,760
uh, it doesn't, uh, hold you
back.

1205
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:20,960
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great.
