00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:18,303
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:21,094
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:23,974
coding journey, and they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:26,673
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:29,653
you here with me. Today is my
cohost Dan.

8
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:34,323
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we got
to talk to Mark Noonan. Mark is a

9
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:38,344
senior engineer at Cypress.io and
is a co-organizer at Code for

10
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:41,404
Atlanta. He also works as a
program developer for People

11
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:44,683
Making Progress ,an Atlanta based
nonprofit serving adults with

12
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,734
developmental disabilities at
home, work and in the community.

13
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:51,219
Um, mark shared with us how his
background in music and theater

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,509
informs his work as a developer,
which I found really interesting.

15
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:56,649
And then we spent the rest of the
episode talking about his

16
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,889
experience in civic tech, how
working with local civic tech

17
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,518
groups can benefit your
community, uh, can benefit other

18
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:06,819
developers and, and of course
your own career as a developer.

19
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:10,215
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

20
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:13,365
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

21
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,745
we're from, we do and a random
check-in question. We hope you

22
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:28,510
enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question. Is,

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,980
would you rather be the funniest
or the smartest person in the

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,051
room? So my name is Bekah. I am a
front end developer from a small

25
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:43,200
town in Ohio. And I think I would
like to be the funniest person in

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,460
the room it, because it makes it
easier to talk to people. And

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,561
you're more likable, I think. And
my grandma was funny and I always

28
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,691
want to be as funny as my
grandma. So I'm going with that.

29
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:01,516
Dan: Uh, hi, I'm Dan. I am a
developer from Cleveland, Ohio.

30
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:05,686
And, um, yeah, I don't know. I
feel like lots of times the

31
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:10,036
funniest person often is pretty
smart anyway, you know, um, like

32
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,586
I don't want to be the person in
the room that everybody's

33
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:20,116
laughing at, you know, but, um,
right. So sure. I, I would take a

34
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:24,360
funniest person and then. that
means you are absolutely not the

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,931
smartest person in the room, you
know? Uh, but like could still

36
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,330
have second place or something. I
think that's, I think that's

37
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:30,661
good.

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,195
Bekah: So now you're claiming
second place. Smartest first

39
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:34,635
Second place smart

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,411
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as long
as that's in the realm of

41
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,320
possibility, I'm not saying, you
know, I'm not saying that's, I'm

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,561
saying, you know, this, this
exercise, you know, if I say I'm

43
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,730
always the smartest or the
funniest person in the room, you

44
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,520
know, but it's not like saying
that means you're also the least

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,871
smart person in the room.

46
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,170
Bekah: No, that was not one

47
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,901
Dan: It's still open. Yeah.
That's what I'm saying. So it's

48
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,721
still, it's still possibility. I
could at least still imagine that

49
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,151
I'm the second smartest person in
the room.

50
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:00,610
Bekah: right.

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,161
Dan: If I've made this choice.

52
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,450
Bekah: You're the funniest you
can imagine that you are the

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,621
second smartest person.

54
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,151
Dan: All right. That's it. That's
my answer. Yes.

55
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,605
Mark: All right. Um, and I'm Mark
Noonan. I am a senior engineer at

56
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:18,195
cypress.io. Um, I live in
Atlanta, Georgia, and I'm mostly

57
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:22,276
happy just to be in the room.
That's good for me. Um, I

58
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,876
probably would prefer to be the
funniest person than the smartest

59
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,955
person. Uh, if I had to make that
choice, but in this specific room

60
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:33,256
with the two of you, I will take
first place, smartest person

61
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,716
ahead of Dan and

62
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:36,015
Dan: I mean

63
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,626
Bekah: Gues I'm third place then,

64
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,635
Dan: somebody had do it.

65
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:40,616
Mark: if, this how the

66
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,596
Bekah: I'm gonna fight for
funniest. And then I'll be third

67
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,316
place. First smartest.

68
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,265
Dan: I mean, I called dibs on
second place. I don't know what

69
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:47,566
to tell you.

70
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,596
Bekah: I didn't even know that
was an option. wasn't an option.

71
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,376
You made it up.

72
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,006
Dan: That's it. Listen, I always
gotta call dibs when its

73
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:56,121
available.

74
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:59,241
Mark: Everbody in a room of three
it's. Okay. Everybody's walking

75
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,441
away with something yet.

76
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,735
Bekah: I I like I have lost in
the, I got the participation

77
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:10,395
ribbon I got purple ribbon.
Welcome Mark, and is really good

78
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:13,695
to have you here with us and
being the smartest person in the

79
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:19,966
room. so we'll let you do most of
the talking today. Um, we always

80
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,865
like to start off with your
origin story, how you got to this

81
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,946
point of where you are in your
developer career. So you could

82
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,115
give us your overview, we would
love here it.

83
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:34,565
Mark: Okay. Um, I'm going to try
to remove some of the twists and

84
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,495
turns. Um, but the short version
is I kind of thought about doing

85
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,615
this job really since I was a
teenager, I started making

86
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:46,675
websites and stuff like that. Um,
but when I was like 16, 17, yeah.

87
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:50,776
I was in Ireland where I grew up
and I was learning bits and

88
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:54,076
pieces of programming and hitting
some problems. And I just hit a

89
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:57,196
point where I was sure this was
not for me. Like you had to be

90
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,336
more into maths. You have to be
smarter than I was to be good at

91
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:05,475
programming. Um, and a lot of
that had to do with what was

92
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:08,865
available to me. Education wise,
if you get stuck with a book that

93
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:13,935
you got from the library, um,
just very hard, like back then,

94
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:17,565
this is right around the year,
2000, it's a little bit harder to

95
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:21,615
get resources than it is today.
So I ended up going to college

96
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:25,365
for music and English and, um,
did a master's in ethnomusicology

97
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:28,485
like That's my education
background loved all of that

98
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,755
stuff, but I kind of kept getting
sucked into making websites on

99
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:38,776
the side. Um, and gradually like
found more and more things where

100
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:41,026
I'm like, oh, I wish I could do
that. So I could make this for

101
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:45,300
this reason, for this family
business or whatever. Yeah. And

102
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,961
eventually found myself finding
things like free code camp and CS

103
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:54,690
50, um, using those courses to
learn more. that kind of got me

104
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,781
into the Atlanta Free Code Camp
Community, which got me connected

105
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,560
to Code for Atlanta, which is
like civic tech code for America

106
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,100
non-profit work, which really
aligned with the, my day job,

107
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,891
which was at a nonprofit, working
with adults with developmental

108
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:11,610
disabilities. Um, so I just kept
doing more stuff and learning

109
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,586
more things until like, it was
kind of obvious. I was able to do

110
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,346
this for a job and it was time to
start thinking about switching.

111
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:24,985
And so that led me to, being
developer Twitter, following

112
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,185
people, uh, connecting with
people there. And that kind of

113
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,036
introduced me to some places
where I could interview and

114
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,466
slowly get better at
interviewing. And then, you know,

115
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,036
I found a job.

116
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,721
Bekah: That's awesome. I love the
non-traditional backgrounds and I

117
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,300
feel like we hear a lot of people
that have come from music

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,411
backgrounds and made the
transition into dev world. And my

119
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,130
background's in English too. Did
you find like you were able to

120
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,031
use any transferable skills or
that background helped you in

121
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,420
some way as you learned to code?

122
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,115
Mark: I I think looking back,
there are a couple of ways. Um,

123
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:03,935
is like you practice music,
you're able to get into flow as

124
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,281
you play. Um, and so there's
this. It happens with writing

125
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:11,011
too, where you have this
experience on your own of working

126
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,500
on something and being in the
moment of like, and stuff coming

127
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,680
together. it can still be
challenging, but it's sort of fun

128
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,550
and you don't notice the time
passing. Um, and it seems like

129
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,980
when we're learning development
or actually doing like the

130
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,680
day-to-day work, um, being able
to get into that state, um, kind

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,920
of on-demand is really useful so
that you can actually settle in

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,141
and achieve something and a few
hours. Without quite having a

133
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:41,130
full plan going in how you do it.
I think that's useful from

134
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,880
playing an instrument. Um, also
we used to have to read like big

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,050
symphony scores or just lots of
interconnected pieces. And you're

136
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,831
supposed to be able to talk about
how they work together. And I was

137
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,120
never like really that into the
theory part of what we were doing

138
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,975
in college, but it did exercise a
part of my brain that was like,

139
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,826
and same with plays and with,
with any kind of complicated

140
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:08,055
structures you're supposed to get
into, um, theater was a big thing

141
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:11,745
for me in college. And so the
combination of like thinking

142
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:16,516
about a hour or two long play as
a whole script and writing some

143
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:21,826
and directing some as well as, we
have this big, complicated thing

144
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:25,636
but we have 48 hours to build all
the sets and stand this show up

145
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,425
and do it for a week. And there's
a lot of rushing around as well

146
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,625
as trying to maintain this
complicated. Like, so all of

147
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,926
that, at least I feel like it
exercise some of the same stuff

148
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:41,346
mentally for me that I'm using
now being directly like how to

149
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,066
write a form in HTML or
something.

150
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,081
Dan: I love that. Never really
connected the flow state thing

151
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:52,311
with you. You're totally right
with me between music and, and

152
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,610
developing. Um, I like the, I
mean, I just really liked the way

153
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,581
you described that and it is
true. Like once you said it, you

154
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,860
know, I thought I thought about
it and it is the exact same way.

155
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,530
Like, and you can feel when
you're not in it too, you know,

156
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,931
but you can feel when you're in
it. And that idea of like,

157
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,581
putting, just getting started on
something and not knowing exactly

158
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,671
how it's going to turn out, but
you're, you know, and it it's

159
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,650
like you're driving it, but it's
still like you're in that flow,

160
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,681
so you're not forcing it. And at
the end, something, hopefully at

161
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,150
least something, something has
come out, um, I, I had never, I

162
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,750
never connected those, those two,
the music, like the music flows

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,270
state and then developing flow
state before. I, I really

164
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,201
appreciate that. That was cool.

165
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,416
Bekah: Yeah, I liked that a lot.
And like, thinking about how all

166
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,546
of the pieces are working
together and whatever you're

167
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:41,625
doing. that sometimes we think
about transferable skills, like,

168
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,655
okay. And how do they exactly
match up? But you're talking

169
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,946
about like exercising, the same
muscles or the same part of your

170
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:53,446
brain to learn new things. And
you know, if you're breaking down

171
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:59,370
a poem if you are matching
patterns, is. When you're writing

172
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,910
or playing music, those are all
things that we're doing as

173
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,130
coders. It doesn't necessarily
mean that we can understand

174
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,091
directly how that works, but I
think it certainly helps to build

175
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:15,750
those skills as we learn new
things.

176
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:20,520
Mark: Yeah. And I think it sort
of, when I started to listen to

177
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:25,591
specific podcasts, as programmers
were talking, this is what kind

178
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,221
of helped me go from learning on
my own to being able to with

179
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:33,150
others and interact with other
developers. was like, I got quite

180
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,640
far on my own, but I didn't know
how to say any of the words out

181
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,721
loud. So listening to podcasts,
when called Coding Blocks and

182
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,931
stuff like Code Newbie. And let
me hear how developers were

183
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:46,980
talking. And one concept was like
levels of abstraction. And

184
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,461
they're talking about not mixing
levels of abstraction, which when

185
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:55,890
you're new that's a complicated
concept because you have, you're

186
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,410
not sure what levels of
extraction means. Let alone to

187
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,681
know if you're mixing them or
not. Um, but when I start to

188
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:05,520
think of like, yeah, you can
spend time looking at a single

189
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,740
line in a, in a play or something
or, uh, the conversation or the

190
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,821
whole scene and zoom out further
to see how things like structure

191
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:21,750
really relate to each other. Um,
and understanding what layer of

192
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,591
the structure you're in, when
you're doing something. Yeah.

193
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,451
Like the ability to zoom in and
out to a specific layer and

194
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:33,360
understand its purpose and the
structure connected above and

195
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,640
below it. Um, that is hard to
like articulate, I think, in

196
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,360
programming because it's often so
abstract. but when you're making

197
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,431
art, you have to think about
those layers all the time,

198
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,801
because you're working on the
details of a piece and on the

199
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,160
whole, the whole piece and each
script do it seamlessly without

200
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,461
knowing that you're zooming in
and out. Um, but I do think they

201
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,100
kind of relate.

202
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,020
Bekah: Oh, absolutely. And I love
that that's, that was such a

203
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,010
great description of how you kind
of look at things together and,

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,551
and have to break it apart at the
same time and move back at that.

205
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:13,456
It is it's like, um, I was gonna
like, when. No, it's not coming

206
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:17,625
there. was something in there
about like being blurry and not

207
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,696
being blurry, but.

208
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:22,250
Mark: no, I think that you like,
especially with your background

209
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,630
in writing. There's a first draft
where you cannot get lost in the

210
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,321
details, or you'll never finish
the first draft. Um, and that's a

211
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:35,030
whole different layer of the
work, trying to get something

212
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,250
that has roughly the structure
you want. Um, and it's, uh, it's

213
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,160
so difficult to make progress if
you get stuck on one paragraph or

214
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,941
one sentence. Um, and I actually
I'm bad at that. I don't write

215
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,926
and never wrote novels or
attempted to write a novel. Um,

216
00:12:54,076 --> 00:13:00,755
because cannot, um, sustain that
first draft mode long enough to,

217
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,765
to really produce something like
that. So I ended up really

218
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:06,436
liking, working in theater,
really liking, working on poems

219
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:11,385
and songs because that lives in
the zoomed in world of a smaller

220
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:14,326
structure where I feel happy, and
I feel like it's okay to spend

221
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,316
time working on sentences,
paragraphs, words, line breaks.

222
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:24,270
Okay. And uh, if I try to write a
400 page novel like that, I just

223
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,150
would never, ever get it done.
Um, so yeah, I think that that

224
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,061
blurry not blurry makes some
sense in that sense.

225
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,600
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. And you know,
like when you're going there's,

226
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,880
your rough draft, right. For no
matter what you do, like you can

227
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,186
have a coding, rough draft to
where you're. Get it working.

228
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:50,056
Right. But that you can make the
code better. so I think even

229
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:52,936
like, if you break down the
process, you can pseudo code

230
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:56,566
something and then you can code
and make it work. And that's your

231
00:13:56,566 --> 00:14:00,466
second draft. And then you can go
back and do those revisions that

232
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:04,456
really make it do what you want
it to do, but also like how you

233
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:08,115
want it to do it in the most
efficient way that you can. Um, I

234
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,625
like thinking of that as part of
the process. I don't think that I

235
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:14,865
thought about that before, but
that makes a lot of sense to me.

236
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,365
Mark: Yeah, lately, I've started
a routine where I will do that.

237
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:22,115
Get it working past first, even
if it's horrendous. Um, and then

238
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,086
I will write the tests for the
thing that I just wrote that's

239
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:29,466
working so that, um, I can go
through and refactor and try to

240
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:34,650
make it right. Code-wise and you
know, to think about reuse and

241
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,561
thinking about readability and
stuff. Um, and then at a certain

242
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:41,071
point, I know it's still wrong,
but I have to cut it off and make

243
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:45,120
a pull request because there's,
there's not much value in making

244
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,801
it better to read or, or like
more efficient to reuse something

245
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:54,765
because we do have to actually
complete work. Which also really

246
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:57,225
reminds me of when I used to send
poems out to magazines. I'm like,

247
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:01,785
I know this is still terrible,
but it's time. It's time to send

248
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,346
it out. Um,

249
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,520
Bekah: I found magazine, poetry
magazine editors were the meanest

250
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,980
people that I have ever met. They
would the meanest rejections

251
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,510
this. You are personally
attacking me. What is, why, why

252
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,630
did you do that to me?

253
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Mark: I used to, I think the, the
framing of this that I heard was

254
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,620
that, um, like poems are never
finished. They're just abandoned,

255
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,110
like at a certain point and you
have to move on with your life

256
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,730
and start writing the next one.
Um, and so there's so many even

257
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,150
great things that we love that
people have made that you look

258
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,275
back and you just see, these are,
um, you know, The things somebody

259
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:49,186
felt anxious about and hated and
thought it was, it's still not

260
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:52,275
finished when they released it.
And like, luckily you don't get

261
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:55,155
to actually experience that when
you read the work.

262
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:56,035
Bekah: Yeah.

263
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:00,630
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I think that's
true. And I, I mean, you were

264
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,610
saying this, but I think that's
true of pretty much anything you

265
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,711
can create. Right. I mean, you
can try to improve things

266
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:13,155
forever, you know? And, um, I've
heard that advice. You know, from

267
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:16,125
a lot of other people too, is
especially, uh, when it comes to

268
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,275
maybe blogging, things like that.
Right. It's like, just get it out

269
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,365
there, you know, and then you can
always improve it if you want to

270
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:27,706
later, um, you know, Jono was on
talking about the, um, was it the

271
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:31,995
digital garden, you know, and,
um, how you can kind of put

272
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,546
something out there even in a
rough draft. I mean, like it's up

273
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:37,275
to your comfort level, but it's
okay to like put, put things out

274
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,721
there, you know? that aren't
completely perfect because

275
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:43,410
nothing is ever going to be
completely perfect and accepting

276
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,571
that it can be hard for sure.
I've found myself deep in a hole

277
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:52,410
spending half an afternoon on
something that literally like has

278
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,291
no effect on the world and nobody
is ever going to notice or care

279
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,961
if it's better or is, or, you
know, and I'm just like, I know I

280
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,230
could do the, you know, I can
have, I know I can get better. I

281
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,870
know I can like whatever and, it
can be easy, be easy to step into

282
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,171
that trap.

283
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,631
Mark: Yeah. That's all. It was
the stuff that ends up later on

284
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,131
getting like cut from the
roadmap.

285
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,066
Dan: Yeah. And then that reminds
me, that does, the other thing I

286
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,465
was going to say is, is getting
that poll request. So like, there

287
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:18,336
is a, there is a, a level of
refinement that you want to wait

288
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,596
until other people maybe have
looked at something first to, to

289
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,185
confirm that it's even going to
stay, that it's even going to be

290
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:29,435
worth like the, uh, the extra
time, you know, if needed or, or

291
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,806
even if it's needed, you know?
Um, and most of the time, I think

292
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,516
when a teammate will look at
something, they'll be like, yeah,

293
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,141
This is good. You know, this is
good enough. Like let's, let's

294
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,570
keep moving. Cause we can put
efforts, you know, in other

295
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,451
places, but it can be hard to let
go sometimes.

296
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:48,111
Bekah: Yeah. And so, so we're
talking about, you know, relating

297
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:51,260
all of these different things
from music and writing and

298
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,810
coding. And so you have this
non-traditional background, but

299
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,461
you also, um, done a lot of work,
helping other people from

300
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,080
non-traditional backgrounds
coming into the industry. Um, can

301
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,141
you just talk a little bit about,
you know, how you've done that

302
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,691
and maybe share a highlight
story?

303
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:15,945
Mark: Yeah, totally. Um, so for,
for me, Like the thing that

304
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:19,486
really helped me about this as a
job and change was starting to go

305
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:25,996
to meetups in Atlanta. Um, and at
my first meetup, it was a, it was

306
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:30,615
a meetup for to think that
pancakes might be about to

307
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:35,895
arrive. No, maybe yes. Unclear.
Okay. We're going to move on.

308
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,695
Bekah: can go check for your
pancakes.

309
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,695
Dan: I are there pancakes for all
of us?

310
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:40,816
Mark: Let's find out.

311
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,296
Bekah: I don't like pancakes.

312
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,086
Dan: You don't like pancakes,

313
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,645
Bekah: like a savory breakfast
person. I usually don't like the

314
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,306
sweet stuff.

315
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,365
Dan: but Bekah,

316
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,675
Bekah: Maybe crepes that are like
stuffed with cream cheese,

317
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,836
filling that I will take those.

318
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,935
Dan: I'd do a savory crepe. A
Crepe I would prefer to be savory

319
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,296
then than sweet, like a, like a
crepe with like cheese and meat

320
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:08,596
or something in it, you know, but
like, Pancakes, but Pancake you

321
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,355
can like a pancake on its own if
you make it, unless you're going

322
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,846
crazy yet. It's not very sweet.
Right. And so it's all about how

323
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:16,455
much, like stuff you put on top
of it. Right.

324
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,980
Bekah: it was just like boring. I
don't know.

325
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,895
Dan: But I'm saying mix it in
with some of your, some like meat

326
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,205
and eggs and you know, and a
little bit of syrup because you

327
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,695
know, a little bit of sweet with
a savory, you know, like really

328
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,016
like helps everything kinda.

329
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,175
Bekah: Are you telling me to mix
up my pancakes with meat.

330
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:32,401
Dan: not mixed. I mean, I'm
saying eat them on a plate

331
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:36,721
together. Not, not mixed not like
mixed up next to each other and

332
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,971
then eat them at the same time as
if it was a meal

333
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:40,746
Mark: they, they,

334
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,361
Dan: with multiple points. Like.

335
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,135
Mark: um, eitherway I have
pancakes now I'm not going to eat

336
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:48,566
them right next to microphone
though, for, for everyone's

337
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:54,445
benefit. Um, but, uh, so get back
to this first meetup I went to,

338
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:56,635
is, uh, like

339
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,046
Bekah: Thanks for bringing it
back, Mark. Cause I could've

340
00:19:59,046 --> 00:19:59,226
gone.

341
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,476
Dan: I know I'm already spiraling
on this pancake thing.

342
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:11,760
Mark: So Yeah. So I. Part of Free
Code Camp was your onboarding and

343
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,461
Free Code Camp. And they tell you
to go join the Facebook group for

344
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,641
your city. Um, and if there's not
a Facebook group in your city,

345
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,490
you're supposed to start it. So
it's really good. It was, that

346
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,580
was how it was back then, at
least. Um, I found the Facebook

347
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,510
group for Free Code Camp Atlanta,
and, uh, there were meeting at a

348
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,361
certain coffee shop at a certain
time. So my first tech meetup, I

349
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:33,480
was pretty nervous. I didn't know
how to act at a tech meetup. I

350
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,971
didn't know too many people in
Atlanta yet, or what even

351
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:39,540
happened there. So I go to the
coffee shop. And I see a group of

352
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,141
like six or seven people sitting
around a table with laptops and

353
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,590
talking and stuff. And I'm like,
okay, this is obviously the right

354
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,441
group. And so I walk up and I'm
talking to them for a few minutes

355
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,510
asking people, what are they
working on? You know, just

356
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,431
they're like, Hey, what are you
doing? I'm learning this and

357
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,941
working on some Java script. And
then at some point I mentioned

358
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:01,451
Free Code Camp and they didn't
know what I was talking about.

359
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:01,726
Bekah: Yeah.

360
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,375
Mark: This was a group of
strangers. Who were just

361
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:13,125
tolerating me, interrupting their
meeting. And they were just too

362
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:18,016
nice to tell me to go away. Um,
and so once we figured it out, we

363
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:20,385
had a little bit of a laugh and I
was like, okay, well, the worst

364
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,996
has happened. This the worse
thing that could possibly happen

365
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:27,445
with these meetups. So I'm
through that. Um, but what it was

366
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:30,945
was people were from code for
Atlanta. And so they were like,

367
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:33,705
we're, we're not your meetup that
you came to, but we do run a

368
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:38,836
different meetup and you should,
you should come to that. I was

369
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:41,175
like, there's no way I'm going to
go to that. I can't live this

370
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:45,316
moment down. Does no, just, uh,
going to stay as far away from

371
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:49,306
that as I can obviously. And, uh,
so I went over to the other table

372
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,796
where there were just two people
sitting down there that was like,

373
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:58,441
asked a crucial question. Are you
Free Code Camp meet up, um, and

374
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:02,790
who was sitting there was Nerando
Johnson and our friend Krista,

375
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:06,060
that's the two people that were
there. And, uh, obviously that

376
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,361
was a life-changing moment for
me, cause me and Nerando and

377
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:12,240
Krista had been friends ever
since, um, and help each other.

378
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,980
So the kindness of everybody at
that meetup and through people

379
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,836
showing up to just like. I
realized that week after week,

380
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:24,496
people were going there who were
not just learning, but also

381
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,776
people who had been through it
and people who had jobs and were

382
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,465
coming back just to hang out and
answer questions and support. Um,

383
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:34,155
and so I learned so much from
those meetups, having specific

384
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:37,365
people there who could say, oh,
the problem you're having today,

385
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:42,861
the solution is not. Continue
hacking in the bad way that

386
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,830
you're hacking the solution is
you should learn Firebase so that

387
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,191
you can users and have data
stored properly. And that will

388
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:52,070
solve like all of the pain that
you're having, trying to

389
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,941
something weird with cookies or
write to the server in PHP or

390
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,840
whatever. Um, so those moments
were really helpful for me. And

391
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,411
going to, when I actually did
start going to Code for Atlanta,

392
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,431
getting into the hackathons
there, like just improved my

393
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:13,201
confidence and improve my skills.
So having gone through that, I

394
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:17,820
think it's nice to sort of pay
that back when are new in the

395
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,461
industry as well. You always
learn a lot when you're trying to

396
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:26,310
help people. I vividly remember
the sort of embarrassment and

397
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,040
hesitation that you feel when
you're starting to learn and

398
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,861
trying to convince yourself that
it's possible to switch careers.

399
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:38,855
And, um, it seems ridiculous. So,
uh, Yeah. I like those. I like

400
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:43,445
doing kind of portfolio reviews,
mock interviews. Um, since I've

401
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:46,685
been on the hiring type a little
bit as well, like those are

402
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:50,586
really useful. Um, and you get to
know people and, um, kinda make

403
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,796
connections that stick with you.

404
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:56,965
Bekah: Yeah, That's awesome. And
I think that, like you were

405
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,625
saying about learning Firebase
rather than, than continuing

406
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,655
hacking in a way that doesn't
make sense. That's so hard to

407
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:07,796
figure out if you're learning on
your own, because it just really

408
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:12,060
depends on what resources. You've
read and how you've understood

409
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,780
things. You know sometimes there
are resources, there are blog

410
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,651
posts out there that are not
giving you the best information.

411
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,951
And so recognizing that like,
Hey, there's a lot written out

412
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:27,510
there. Not everything is going to
you the right ways or the best

413
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,240
practices and figuring out how to
discern between what is a good

414
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,711
resource and not can be really,
really tricky. On your own. So

415
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:40,681
that's why meetups like that are,
are awesome.

416
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,516
Dan: Yeah, I would just, I would
also say. This is true, even if

417
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,445
you're not learning, you know, uh
it's you can be very expensive,

418
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,596
like be developing for a long
time. Uh, but being kind of

419
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:55,766
isolated and it's possible. And I
say, this has, you know, person

420
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:58,976
who I'm describing myself a
couple of years ago, basically.

421
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:03,175
Uh, but it's, it's like it that
exposure to other people. And

422
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,546
it's just, like mark said, like,
oh, just use Firebase. Like

423
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:09,455
somebody just saying that, and it
doesn't have to. Somebody who's,

424
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,736
you know, a mentor or somebody
who is teaching or whatever, it

425
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,435
can be somebody who's also just
learning, you know what I mean?

426
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:18,185
But that, those, uh, that, that
exposure to other people who are,

427
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,766
who are doing the same sorts of
things as you are, it's, it's so

428
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:24,695
important. And so, and, and
useful, uh, just even on a, on a

429
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:28,296
like tactical level, you know
what I mean? It just, it just

430
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:33,151
like makes you better. Um,
osmosis, you know, even if you're

431
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,721
not like, uh, actively doing
talks or doing, you know, act

432
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,461
that, you know, whatever,
whatever, just like that exposure

433
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:39,871
to people. Um,

434
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:42,935
Mark: Yeah. and you could go to
that group and just kinda hang

435
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,395
out, um, kind of like the
coworking room and Virtual

436
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:49,266
Coffee, where, uh, sometimes I
went to that meetup and I really

437
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:53,586
didn't say anything to anybody
because I was, um, some jobs. I

438
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:56,915
would usually get there after
work and have like some goal. I

439
00:25:56,915 --> 00:26:00,486
was like, I need to do this. And
for some reason, being around all

440
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:03,195
these people, even if they're
really busily talking. It gives

441
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,925
me enough energy to actually
spend two or three hours coding

442
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:09,915
do the thing I came to do. Um,
versus if I went home, I would

443
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:14,266
just be like, I'm tired after
work not have that energy from

444
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:14,955
those people.

445
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:20,576
Dan: Yeah, it totally. And the
other, the other part is, I mean,

446
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,786
the other benefit of a small
group like that, especially in

447
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:26,215
person wants, which I know is
like very, very hard right now,

448
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:29,635
but, um, uh, you know, it's the
kind of thing we're trying to

449
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:34,026
recapture at least in Virtual
Coffee. Um, but. You know, you,

450
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,685
you can get exposure in on
Twitter, like by following a

451
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:38,875
whole bunch of people. Right. But
you never know exactly what's

452
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,546
going to happen. And if you don't
know the people, then your last

453
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,826
time following people that other
people, you know, based on

454
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,586
numbers and based on what
Twitter's algorithm kind of

455
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:50,576
pushes in front of you and you,
again, you, can't always, you

456
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:54,536
can't always know, uh, exactly
like who people are or whether

457
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,566
you can trust their information
and stuff like that. And, um,

458
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,101
when you're in a group of just
people. Uh, as a small group,

459
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:06,721
it's much more there's no, like
he can't tell how many people

460
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:09,151
follow, like follow that person.
You know, everyone's just sitting

461
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,941
in a room together. There's
nobody has like a, you know,

462
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:16,740
inherent value with air quotes is
value, you know, uh, bigger than

463
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,840
another person, you know, and one
person has 20 followers on

464
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,260
Twitter. Another has, you know,
10,000, but when they're in just

465
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,320
the room together, talking to
them, Sort of everybody's more on

466
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:29,250
a similar level, um, think
improves communication. Yeah.

467
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,861
Mark: And I remember seeing
Krista who is fantastic and was

468
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:37,121
kind of years ahead of me in her
development and like being along,

469
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:43,260
learning. And seeing her, knowing
that she knows more than me and

470
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,290
is really good at what she does.
And when somebody would bring up

471
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,431
a topic that hadn't run into yet,
she would just ask the question

472
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:52,381
and she'd be like, oh, I don't
know what that is. Tell me about

473
00:27:52,381 --> 00:28:00,721
it and not feel the need to like,
um, I don't know, pretend that,

474
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,901
you know, everything or like show
off people aren't going there to

475
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,201
show off. People are going there
to like, Um, and so seeing

476
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,951
somebody that I know is better
than me still comfortable, I'm

477
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:14,191
like, oh, maybe this is why
better than me. Like, this is how

478
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,641
you get good, is you keep asking
questions and you don't try to

479
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:24,211
bluff. and, and like use, use
your curiosity to drive you. Um,

480
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,181
so I do some of those moments
kind of stood out to me that I

481
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:29,520
think you can only witness when
you're in a group and see a

482
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,451
dynamic, um, and see different
people handling situations in

483
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,905
different ways. So Yeah. whether
it's a virtual group or not, but,

484
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,385
um, it's nice that we have these
to other people.

485
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,861
Bekah: Yeah, I think when you
have that exposure, it allows you

486
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:49,080
to build some sort of
relationship of trust and

487
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:53,490
understanding, and there's more
of a comfort level. So there's a

488
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,701
built-in credibility almost. And
so can feel free to free or to

489
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:04,740
ask questions in some situations
to not like even people that I

490
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,570
know from Virtual Coffee, I'm not
a big, um, YouTube tutorial

491
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,010
watcher, but if I know somebody
from Virtual Coffee or if I've

492
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,070
met them in real life, it's
easier for me to watch their

493
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,790
videos. I think because it's
like, okay, yeah, this is, is my

494
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,411
friend. And I know they know what
they're talking about or I know

495
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:27,901
that this person talks about
this, so I'm going to go watch

496
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:32,671
their video. And so it, it allows
for that. I don't know, like, um,

497
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,391
a step towards trusting that they
will be a good resource for you.

498
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,441
Um, so now that experience with
Code for Atlanta was not your

499
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,701
last experience with them, right?

500
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:51,631
Mark: No, no. So this is good.
This and this ties into another

501
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:56,580
thing. That I try to communicate
to new developers, um, which is

502
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,490
how to put things on your resume
that are like closer to

503
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,810
professional work. Then even solo
projects you do on your own. And

504
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,320
for me, Code for Atlanta had a
headache connection for me

505
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,401
because they were running a
hackathon series with Marta is

506
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:18,570
Atlanta's transit agency and
working at people, making

507
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,050
progress, which I'm still
connected with. Uh, I was working

508
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,530
as a job coach and running
supported employment programs

509
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,090
where people would use the, um,
Marta Mobility Service to get

510
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,300
from home to work. So an example
is somebody with down syndrome

511
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,201
who works bagging groceries, or
somebody who's working in a dish

512
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,810
room or something that we use to
support with schedule these

513
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,401
rides. The bus takes you door to
door. Um, but scheduling and

514
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:47,191
everything around scheduling was
done over the phone, which is

515
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,891
pretty difficult for people with
cognitive impairments or speech

516
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,131
impediments, like challenges
around judgment when you're

517
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:57,330
sitting in a phone queue. So I
had a lot of experience of the

518
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,721
pain of working with Marta and
Atlanta Code for Atlanta was

519
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:05,621
running these events. And I saw
it as my chance to like talk to

520
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:09,840
MARTA. Not on the phone, but be
in their face and say, Hey,

521
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,080
here's a, here's a lot of stuff
that's happening on the phone

522
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,280
that probably could be happening
through the website or something

523
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,010
like that. And the hack my
proposal for the hackathon was

524
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,671
here's a better way to handle
like booking and canceling rides

525
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:27,300
and keeping people informed of
when the van is coming. 'Cause

526
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,240
they have a 30 minute window and
sometimes it's Atlanta, there's

527
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,971
always traffic. Sometimes the bus
can be an hour late, be an hour

528
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:37,050
and a half late, but if you're
waiting for it, and they come,

529
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,750
you only have five minutes to get
to the bus before they move on.

530
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,250
So people would just stand
outside for as long as it takes

531
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,000
the hot and the cold and the
rain, whether they have to pee

532
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,810
bad situation for people to just
be waiting without knowing how

533
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,621
long the bus comes. And I could
get more into the weeds of that

534
00:31:55,621 --> 00:32:00,705
problem, but that's the general
idea and the solution, because I

535
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:03,645
knew when I would call on behalf
of somebody and I would pick up

536
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:07,935
the phone and say, Hey, when is
Kevin's bus going to get here? I

537
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:11,236
could feel that that person was
just clicking on a computer and

538
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:14,576
reading a line off of the sheet
and telling me what the time said

539
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:19,006
at like that field of the
estimated time of arrival, which

540
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:22,486
I could just publish that time on
the website, we could read that

541
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:26,086
ourselves and we wouldn't have to
tie up the phones all the time

542
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:31,560
asking about the late buses. So,
um, I went to the hackathon there

543
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,300
and, uh, met some people. I think
I really wanted to go to the

544
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
hackathon because in CS 50, they
explained what a hackathon is.

545
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,601
And I was like, I want to have
that 24 hour experience of like,

546
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:46,320
seeing what it's like to do it.
Um, Nerando came along for that

547
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
hackathon and we met two other
people just chatting beforehand,

548
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,421
who became the team. I learned
about, uh, how to turn like that

549
00:32:54,421 --> 00:33:00,211
idea into a kind of app solution.
So we had somebody who knew about

550
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,020
iOS. He worked on actually
building out an iOS app based on

551
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,931
some wire frames that we made and
some wishlists I had of what we

552
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:12,871
would be able to do. Um, and that
a three-part event. we actually

553
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:16,770
had two more cracks at this. We
convinced MARTA to provide some

554
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,730
data to us about the disability
support service they had, this

555
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,550
was not a part of the hackathon
dataset. This was like,

556
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,131
something, we were bringing in
that we wanted to work on. Um, we

557
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:31,560
worked with them for awhile. We
made a pilot for them that they

558
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,641
actually used for a few weeks.
And as it turned out, they were

559
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,090
separately in negotiations to buy
something that did some similar

560
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,270
stuff. So on the one hand it was
a bummer. We didn't get to like

561
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,780
really ship our code. We were
able to get into meetings with

562
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,560
the third party provider who they
were using to provide this

563
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,560
service and give them early
feedback on what their product

564
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,740
did or didn't do that would be
useful for the population we

565
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,691
wanted it to help. So, um, it got
us like in the room for those

566
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,941
types of conversations and it,
let me put MARTA on my resume as

567
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,440
like I did a project with MARTA.
not saying it was a paid project.

568
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,860
Not saying I was a consultant or
anything, but here's a project

569
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,721
with an organization that you've
heard of in your city, um, that

570
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:21,585
is different to my calculator
that's on code pen. is homework

571
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:26,686
from Free Code Camp and like
using civic tech to connect with

572
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:30,976
nonprofits or other organizations
that you can do work for so that

573
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:34,545
you have something people have
heard of on your resume that

574
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,516
you've contributed to. Maybe you
had requirements, you worked with

575
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:45,496
a team, all this like benefits of
adding to your resume beyond a

576
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:48,976
project you came up with on your
own, really strengthened that.

577
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:52,755
And let me talk about something
different in interviews. So I

578
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:58,456
really believe like my purpose is
Code for Atlanta now is not so

579
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:01,786
much to support any specific
project, but to like support

580
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:04,365
people, building their resumes,
who are new to the industry and

581
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:08,235
have worked for them to do, uh,
that's kind of what motivates me

582
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:11,005
to stay involved and spend some
time like helping to organize

583
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,626
things I'm able to do that.

584
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,681
Bekah: I love that. And I think,
you know, we hear a lot of advice

585
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,601
to early career folks to, you
know, get into open source and

586
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:26,110
that's a good way to build your
resume, I liked this idea of

587
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,885
civic tech. Because it seems like
be a more intimate group of

588
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:36,746
people communicating together.
Whereas you almost feel a lot of

589
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:41,186
open source contributions. Like
you're an outsider coming in and

590
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:45,291
if you need help, it's harder.
Ask because there's not clear

591
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,010
paths of communication or, or
whatever, but you're working on

592
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,521
something that's mission driven
and that has a team of people

593
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:56,960
that need to communicate, those
are certainly all skills that can

594
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,610
be utilizing and kind of building
your own team. Right. So if

595
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,820
you're involved in a community
like code camp or code for

596
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,150
Atlanta Virtual Coffee or
whatever, You can turn to people

597
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,351
and say like, look, there's a
nonprofit in my hometown. And

598
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:16,556
they could really use some help.
I'd love to. Ask them, if I could

599
00:36:16,556 --> 00:36:19,585
work on a project for them, but I
could use some support, is

600
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:23,215
anybody else interested? And I
think that's a really great way

601
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,425
to show, like, look, you are
taking initiative, you are

602
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:31,766
working on a project and that is
not a calculator or, you know, a

603
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:36,956
to-do list app and really, really
kind of own the project yourself

604
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:41,576
is, is a great way to showcase
you can do to learn a lot pretty

605
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,851
quickly. Um, and yeah, to have
something on your resume.

606
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:48,295
Mark: Yeah, and Nerando will be
annoyed if I don't mention this.

607
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,416
Cause I do sometimes forget to
mention this, that project

608
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:55,436
extended into a different, uh,
event. That was a civic tech

609
00:36:55,465 --> 00:37:02,471
challenge. That was run by GE and
AT&T. And so our team kind of re

610
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,681
rebuilt the project, added some
smart city integration because it

611
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:13,570
was a smart city thing. Um, and
we won a $40,000 prize, Uh, which

612
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,690
we didn't expect to win. So we
had all signed in advance that we

613
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,740
agreed to donate this to charity
because we thought maybe we would

614
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,590
come in third or whatever. So
like, um, it's. uh, I think it's

615
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,701
a better story that we gave away
when we were all broke. This is

616
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,311
the thing, like we were not, we
didn't have jobs yet as

617
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:37,751
developers. Um, but we agreed
that so many people had

618
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:40,960
contributed to this, that it
would be kind of unfair for just

619
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,800
the, the six people on the team
at the time of that competition

620
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,021
to walk away with the money, um,
because it was a long project. 20

621
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:54,971
30 people who did something on
it. Um, so we all felt good about

622
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:56,771
that. And we thought maybe we
would come in third, which was

623
00:37:56,771 --> 00:38:01,840
like five grand, not too much.
Um, but you get involved in stuff

624
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,690
like this, it does have
potential. This won't happen to

625
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,190
everybody. It has potential to
snowball into a weird side effect

626
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:17,831
of like donating more to charity.
Then you make it a year. So, uh,

627
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,800
uh, that was good. That was a
good thing that we did and I

628
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,021
still stand by it. But, um, Yeah.
I, I also was wierd if I forget

629
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,541
to finish the story with that
detail.

630
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:31,115
Dan: Yeah, no, he was, he, uh, he
might've mentioned that when he

631
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:35,706
was on the podcast as well. I
think he pretty much felt the

632
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:40,246
same way as you like. Well, I'm
glad we did it... but also...

633
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,831
Mark: Well, the thing, the thing
I like about it is when that's

634
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:48,280
the outcome of a project, it
doesn't matter that like MARTA

635
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,061
didn't use our prototype. We got
money to charities that serve

636
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,471
people with disabilities, which
enables them to increase their

637
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,951
mission and have impact. And like
I, because I worked at one of

638
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:04,976
those charities, I know what that
money is spent on. So through the

639
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,936
channel of civic tech, if you are
able to enter and win prizes and

640
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:12,835
donate prizes, have this other
way of making impact. That's

641
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:18,115
actually probably a little bit
more effective than on any single

642
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:23,396
project to really take off and be
implemented. It's like a lot of

643
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:26,920
the work in civic tech. If it's
not tightly integrated with an

644
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:29,771
actual organization or a
nonprofit is more like proof of

645
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:32,621
concepts. Here's how you could do
your government. Here's how you

646
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,280
could do your MARTA mobility
service. And it shows the way to

647
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,440
something, but it might not be,
um, it might not be the technical

648
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,110
solution that actually gets
implemented, but if it gets the

649
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,380
conversation going or you raise
some money with it, like that's a

650
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,880
valuable output, or if it helps
someone get a job, that's a

651
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,065
valuable output for um, the
activity of civic tech that can

652
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,686
sometimes seem like it goes
nowhere.

653
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:06,161
Dan: Yeah, I love that, you know,
and it's is, uh, Like Bekah was

654
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,800
saying. Yeah. Some people, you
know, it's a little easier to

655
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,951
conceive of going into, trying to
contribute to open source, um,

656
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:15,911
stuff like that, but that it's
civic tech is it's a little more,

657
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,150
um, so what I was gonna say was
it is a little more, um, nebulous

658
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,670
in my mind, if you, excuse me, if
you were, if a developer was like

659
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,221
one or two, start getting
involved in this in maybe they

660
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:31,331
don't live in Atlanta, uh, like
where, where would I look like if

661
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:34,300
I want to. Maybe, you know, try
to get involved in civic tech a

662
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,291
little bit more in Cleveland. Um,
for instance, like, should I just

663
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,661
Google civic tech, Cleveland and
see what comes up or is there

664
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,570
other like specific places, you
know, that you might look first?

665
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,710
Like what, what can we do to, you
know, if somebody wants to do

666
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:45,800
this.

667
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,001
Mark: Within the US, there's
definitely Code for America is

668
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,635
like the umbrella organization.
And Code for America itself is a

669
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:58,916
nonprofit that, um, specific
projects and has employees and

670
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,956
often works with local
governments and organizations

671
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:05,996
like that, but it also supports
the brigade network, which is,

672
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:09,596
um, all around the U S there's
there's many Brigades, I forget

673
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:15,085
how many, but most states have at
least one. Um, you can find your

674
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:19,016
local project from there. And
there are, there are also civic

675
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:22,661
tech communities around the
world. Um, so I guess I'll have

676
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:27,010
to look up the address for that
and we can it somewhere. Um,

677
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,411
yeah, but I know there are
communities in Ireland, there are

678
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:33,010
communities, um, kind of all
around that are United by the

679
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,090
sort of social good impact tech
work. Um, people consider the

680
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,940
actual details of what's
important to focus on differently

681
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,331
in those communities, depending
on kind of what their mission is.

682
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:51,835
Um, obviously my point of view is
like helping people get exposure.

683
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:55,655
Um, very much I'm focused on the
non-profit side of things, not as

684
00:41:55,655 --> 00:42:00,626
much on the interfacing with
government entities. but so there

685
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:04,076
are different roles. You can see
a typical civic tech organization

686
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:10,811
having, um, but it's, uh, it's
really nice when. Most of the

687
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:14,710
time, there is plenty of people
to do the work. And there's also

688
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,070
plenty of projects happening at
once. So you can come in and find

689
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,271
something where you can either
learn or you can participate. Um,

690
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:25,481
and the kind of people who do
these things tend to be of the

691
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,661
helpful variety. Like whoever's
giving up a Tuesday night to go

692
00:42:28,661 --> 00:42:31,871
and work for free for a nonprofit
they never heard of. They're

693
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:35,740
probably nice enough to help you
set up git do things like.

694
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:36,496
Dan: Yeah.

695
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:39,715
Mark: This is where I learned how
to use git properly. It's where I

696
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:43,556
learned how to install packages.
Like just real basic stuff. Came

697
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:46,826
from Code for Atlanta people
helping me there.

698
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:52,226
Bekah: I just want to follow that
up and say that when you're

699
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:55,826
working on you don't have to work
on a time intensive project.

700
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,166
Right. So I know, you know, there
are people that are learning who

701
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,465
have jobs and kids or other
responsibilities, and they might

702
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:04,525
say like, wow, that's just not
doable. But I think that, you

703
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:08,456
know, there are so many different
options out there and, know, one,

704
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:13,405
if you're working on a three-day
project. are going to learn so

705
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:19,226
much in those three days it might
be more than weeks worth of work

706
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:22,885
that you were learning by
yourself. And so, ya know, kind

707
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:26,306
of thinking about the benefits
or, you know, look at a longer

708
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:29,215
project, start something yourself
with other people and say like,

709
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,335
we're going to do this over a
period of six weeks and then

710
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:35,726
evaluate where we are and it's
going to be five hours a week or

711
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:39,835
whatever, you know, it doesn't it
work for you, but those

712
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,615
experiences are invaluable as
you're making your way into the

713
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:44,425
tech industry.

714
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:50,076
Mark: Totally. And I agree it can
be slow. Our, um, our MARTA thing

715
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:54,635
went on for about a year, maybe
more. Um, a lot of it is really

716
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:59,246
incremental. Some of the projects
I worked on only did anything

717
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:03,655
twice a month at the civic hack
night. So I would work really

718
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:06,565
hard to prepare for a civic hack
night because I would have people

719
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:09,056
who wanted to come and work on
something like Free Live

720
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:13,615
Transcript.com that you guys have
seen. Um, so a lot of the work

721
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:16,465
that's on that now came from a
civic hack night where I have

722
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:20,005
like two hours of people I'm
going to try to explain how the

723
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:22,795
whole project works in the first
few minutes and then figure out

724
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:25,405
what everybody's good at and what
they want to do. And come up with

725
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:30,476
tasks and get them assigned out
and like check on them. And

726
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:33,025
sometimes that works beautifully
and sometimes it's hard to get

727
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,416
people going because the, the
code is pretty ugly in there.

728
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:40,376
And, uh, you need a certain level
of experience to, uh, undo what I

729
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:45,235
did when I wrote that project.
But like, uh, sometimes it is

730
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:49,496
effective and you can get eight
hours of work done by four people

731
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:52,536
in a two hour period, which
really moves the project forward.

732
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:56,876
Um, and now four people know how
to work on it. And one of them

733
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:59,335
might have like a bee in their
bonnet and want to come back and

734
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:02,246
fix it the next time. Or
sometimes they just drift off. It

735
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:05,695
doesn't matter. They contributed,
they got something out of it. Um,

736
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:10,945
I kind of liken it to being an a
band in college where sometimes

737
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:15,340
most people would show up to
practice. And like you're relying

738
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,880
on volunteers. Your expectations
should be that things are going

739
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,521
to be slow and every now and then
a hackathon will come and they'll

740
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:27,460
be really fast for a few days,
but mostly you will try to set up

741
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,911
your tickets and try to set up
your list of tasks to be like,

742
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:34,931
anybody can pick this up. And
nothing's too big or too small

743
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:38,291
for someone to take a crack at it
at a hack night. And even the

744
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,271
smallest ticket is really
meaningful. If it's someone's

745
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,420
first pull request, um, that
they've made to an open source

746
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,690
project or something like that.
So fixing a spelling mistake or

747
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,090
whatever, um, can be like, Hey,
so my first time forking a repo

748
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,311
and contributing to open source,
just like we're doing what heck

749
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:58,210
over Fest at this moment in time.
Uh, those do that does kind of

750
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,221
the mystery of how to do that.

751
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:06,175
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I think
that any step forward the

752
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:11,005
momentum. Right? And so if you a
typo or something small, then

753
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:15,846
it's still moving you forward and
getting you ready for the next

754
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:19,746
time you create a pull request
and feeling a little bit more

755
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:22,445
confident as you do that. So I
don't think that we should

756
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:27,916
diminish any contributions. It's
good to get started and to get in

757
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:28,215
there.

758
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,510
Dan: Yeah, and I mean, this is
something we talk about a lot

759
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,501
with Virtual Coffee. It is hard
to get into opensource. You know,

760
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,581
it's, there's a lot of, uh, uh,
and this is true. I'm sure of

761
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:42,460
civic tech just opens doors in
general. Right? There's, there's

762
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,431
a bunch of things to learn, you
know? And so honestly, if you're

763
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:50,081
doing something that is maybe a
small contribution to the code

764
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:53,110
itself, like fixing the, a typo,
um, then it frees you up to

765
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,621
actually just concert and
learning about, get or learning

766
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,981
about pull requests, learning
about, uh, that process, uh,

767
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:03,416
without trying to learn a
mountain of coding stuff at the

768
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:06,416
same time. Right. And, you know,
it's a great way to, I like, it's

769
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:10,195
a, I think that's the best way to
get started in, um, you know, and

770
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,385
get in contribute and, you know,
open source, things like that is,

771
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:17,365
is do, uh, you know, small, small
contributions where you're not

772
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:19,735
overshooting, you know, you're
not biting off a big chunk of

773
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:24,385
something um, code-wise to start
because then you can just

774
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:26,126
concentrate on the one thing,
learning one thing at a time.

775
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,751
Mark: I'm really struck by how,
working in the industry for, four

776
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,791
or five years now or whatever it
is. Um, you're only using a tiny

777
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:44,501
slice of your programming
knowledge at a time. Um, to all

778
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:46,601
that you have learned already,
you're still on using a tiny

779
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:49,240
amount of that. And relative to
all the stuff you could learn,

780
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,820
that's so scary when you're
getting started, you're like

781
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,471
using a little dot of knowledge.
like, I work in a Vue code base

782
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:01,751
and I use Tailwind for CSS and I
do certain things that like, um,

783
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:07,900
are their own little bubble and
have their own documentation. it

784
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,150
doesn't matter that I even know
PHP from before. Um, I'm not

785
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,701
using it. I guess I learned
something from learning that, but

786
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:18,686
like, When you actually see
projects and action and talk to

787
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:21,456
the people they're like, Hey, you
can contribute. And here's the

788
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:24,746
tiny area that you need to know
about. Like, you need to know how

789
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:29,396
to, how to, how to extract this
thing from a loop and JavaScript

790
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:32,096
and make it more efficient. And
here's the tiny piece of

791
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:34,916
documentation that will help you
do that. And then ask me if you

792
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:40,615
need help, like that reveals that
we're still focused on just like

793
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:45,896
really small areas of the overall
practice of programming, um, at

794
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:49,525
any given moment on any given
ticket, we're not using the a

795
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,115
hundred things that we could know
about.

796
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:55,050
Dan: Yeah. I, I mean, absolutely
agree with that. And I think

797
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,391
that's actually another benefit
of getting involved in a project,

798
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:00,121
like a civic hacking project
where somebody else, you know, if

799
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,240
somebody, if you have somebody
like Mark who was sort of running

800
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,751
the project, right. And you join,
um, as, uh, somebody who is

801
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:11,335
learning, um, you know, you can
be provided. One of the

802
00:49:11,335 --> 00:49:14,065
challenges of learning when
you're learning is that cloud of

803
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:16,916
there's a huge amount of things
that you could learn, right? So

804
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,465
if you go to something like this,
I want to contribute like you

805
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:24,056
now, now you have, um, the thing
to do set in front of you, and

806
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,036
maybe you can just concentrate on
learning just that one thing, you

807
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:29,726
know, and it removes the choice,
uh, which, and then maybe you'll

808
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:32,635
find it they'll figure out, well,
I hate this. I don't like

809
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,306
JavaScript or something, or I
don't like something and you can

810
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:40,431
move on, you know, it, um, but
the. That's just another, another

811
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:43,311
benefit of get involved with
groups like this, especially a

812
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:47,451
civic hacking group that is going
to have projects like it's going

813
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,231
to have work to do, you know,
and, and, and help, um, doing it.

814
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,851
Uh, that's my, like my, my go-to
advice for learning is just like,

815
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:57,650
make, do a project, just do
something, you know, and

816
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:02,036
Obviously better, but it can't be
bad advice. Cause like, well,

817
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:05,186
what do I do then, Dan? And then
I'm like, well, I don't know that

818
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,565
this is like something that
provides that,

819
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,431
Mark: And I'll say as well, it,
it provided me with leadership

820
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:15,030
experience. I did not go in
wanting to run the project. I was

821
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,516
like, so if I have an idea, Do I
also have to run it and they're

822
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:23,626
like, Yeah, you have to do, if
its your idea, you pitch it and

823
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:30,596
you own it. will get join your
team. Um, I was like, okay, I'll,

824
00:50:30,706 --> 00:50:33,565
I'll learn how to pitch a
project. And I would be very

825
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:38,786
nervous at first. And, um, I got
feedback one night from somebody

826
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,726
who was like part of the local
Toastmasters or something,

827
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:43,405
happened to be there.

828
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:45,306
Bekah: it's a recurring theme
here, toastmasters.

829
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:46,570
Dan: Yeah, it was, was it Gant?

830
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:51,226
Mark: I don't know, but it was
just like, uh, he, offered take

831
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:54,496
notes on me pitching and give me
like he had three or four points.

832
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:57,135
He's like, you move way too much.
Your, your idea is good and your

833
00:50:57,135 --> 00:50:59,476
communications clear, but you
speak too softly and you're

834
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:03,195
swaying and it's distracting, but
here's the good things, you know,

835
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:08,266
and that was a, you don't have to
remember much advice to be like,

836
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:12,585
okay, I'm going to move less. Um,
and try to slow down a little.

837
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:17,996
Uh, uh, just from being at a hack
night happening to run into

838
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:20,516
people who are experienced,
looking at how you're doing when

839
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:24,565
you speak. Um, so a lot of
benefits for me, random

840
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:27,925
unpredictable benefits from being
involved in Code for Atlanta.

841
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:31,081
Bekah: When I want to follow up
on that too, and say that that's

842
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:34,501
a skillset, right. That you're
learning. Not everybody can

843
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:38,920
pitch. It's not a natural thing.
I, well, maybe for some people

844
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,041
it's a natural thing that you're
born with, but a lot of us, it's

845
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:45,760
a skill that we need to work on
and get evaluation. And mean, it

846
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,101
goes right along with
interviewing, right? Because you

847
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:52,541
are essentially pitching yourself
and if you're using the wrong

848
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:56,545
tone, I will never forget. I
think I was 11 years old. It was

849
00:51:56,545 --> 00:52:00,025
my first science fair project.
And the highest you could get was

850
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:03,655
a superior. I got an excellent
and I was like very upset with my

851
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:09,326
excellent and the feedback I got
was, um, inappropriate inflection

852
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,565
at the end of sentences. Right.
So what that means is when I

853
00:52:12,565 --> 00:52:16,016
talked, I would talk and, and
like, it was a question than

854
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:20,820
actually saying what. Actually
knew about the project, And so

855
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:27,210
there, you lose credibility. And
I worked very hard to not do that

856
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,760
anymore, but that feedback has
allowed me to grow as a speaker

857
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,971
and be more deliberate and think
through how I'm doing things and.

858
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:42,175
So maybe your tone is wrong when
you're interviewing and you're

859
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:46,826
not coming off as credible, or
maybe you're not completing your

860
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:50,166
sentences. There there've been
times in my life where would just

861
00:52:50,186 --> 00:52:53,576
start a sentence and then would
get overwhelmed with people

862
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:57,206
looking at me and I would just
stop. There was no end to that

863
00:52:57,206 --> 00:53:01,436
sentence. And usually I ended it
with, so, and that was to me.

864
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:07,240
didn't know where go from there.
It's something that I have to

865
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,021
think about still even, you know,
if I'm in a situation where I

866
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,021
suddenly get uncomfortable, like
don't end your sentence with, so

867
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,251
it's a complete

868
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,311
Mark: implies that you're going
to keep speaking. So it actually

869
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:20,650
makes it take even longer for
people to realize that you've

870
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,251
stopped.

871
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:25,581
Bekah: Just like once someone to
pick it up for me. So who

872
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:30,666
Dan: I've never done anything
like that, except for every

873
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,806
single podcast episode.

874
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,010
Mark: Oh yeah. But But's another
one. Sometimes I'll be like, so

875
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,661
yeah, that's it. But, uh,

876
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:41,030
Bekah: Yes. Yes. 100% do that.

877
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:43,195
Dan: Well, you probably looked
through the transcripts and just,

878
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,376
just see all the times I've done
that. even on the podcast.

879
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,271
Mark: I'm very self-conscious
about how much I may have done

880
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:49,260
that in the last hour.

881
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:50,635
Dan: Oh,

882
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,420
Mark: We'll find out.

883
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:58,451
Dan: Yeah, we have a, um, we're
using, uh, what's it called, uh,

884
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:01,601
Descript now for, uh, podcast
editing, which is a really cool

885
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:04,690
tool. But one of the things it
does is highlights, filler words.

886
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,041
And like, I don't like there, we
could just remove them all or

887
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:11,291
something, you know? I mean, I, I
know that there, I'm sure there's

888
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:15,731
some podcasts that will do that
or whatever. Um, I don't do that

889
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,641
both because it is
time-consuming, but also I, you

890
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:21,731
know, is pretty, it's a pretty
chill, you know, podcasts in

891
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:25,840
general, but it does highlight
all of them. And I can see them

892
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,751
in my, you know, in the
transcripts for my, uh,

893
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:30,101
paragraphs of talking it's.

894
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,400
Mark: Published a stats Dan.
Don't keep this from the people.

895
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:38,561
Dan: I don't think I'm going to
do that. It'd be too

896
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:42,161
embarrassing, but I'll do it for,
maybe I'll do it for just this

897
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:42,731
episode.

898
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:45,615
Bekah: But we have transcripts
available for every episode. So

899
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,976
if somebody would like to just go
do a control, find, you will know

900
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:53,956
how many ums we have had in every
episode, you can publish it for

901
00:54:53,956 --> 00:55:00,666
us. Well, I think we're about at
time Mark. This was really great

902
00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:04,565
to hear about civic tech. I
actually am really excited to go

903
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:09,675
find some civic tech projects and
think about how I can involved in

904
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:13,775
this more, is there any last
piece of advice you have for

905
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:14,416
listeners?

906
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:25,005
Mark: Em, I think that it's. It's
natural to not be sure if we're

907
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:27,826
talking to listeners specifically
who are learning development,

908
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:31,516
which is not everybody like in
the Virtual Coffee Community. Um,

909
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:35,896
but like I remember so much
hesitation and, and not being

910
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:38,775
sure that this was the right
thing or it was gonna work out,

911
00:55:39,405 --> 00:55:43,775
um, that does not mean that it's
not the right thing or it's not

912
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:47,706
going to work out. So I would
suggest people find some way to

913
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:51,846
live with that feeling. It may
well be there for many years into

914
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:58,085
your career for a lot of us. and,
uh, it's just not a very useful

915
00:55:58,085 --> 00:56:01,956
feeling. So, uh, I would
encourage people to let it be

916
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:05,405
and, uh, keep working regardless
and don't pay any mind to the

917
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:08,166
part of you that's saying that,
uh, cause it's not going to help

918
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:12,501
you learn and, uh, Obviously from
the amount of people who have

919
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,360
come through the same journey,
these people that are going on,

920
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:16,760
uh, it doesn't, uh, hold you
back.

921
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:20,960
Bekah: Yeah, that's so great.
thanks so much for being here
