00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season 1, episode

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,339
5 of the Virtual Coffee Podcast.
I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,519
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,670
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,299
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,329
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,689
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co-host, Dan.

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,979
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today on
this episode, you'll hear from

9
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,369
Rahat Chowdhury, and Cameron
Bardell. Rahat is a

10
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,640
second-career developer, mental
health advocate, live coding

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,700
streamer, and a rapper. He is
also the founder of a mental

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,939
health startup called Whimser,
which is aimed at providing

13
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,140
tools to help keep up your
mental health. Cameron is an iOS

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,379
developer in the healthcare
industry from Waterloo, Ontario.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,439
He is also in the final stages
of an undergraduate degree in

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,340
physics and computer science. In
this episode, we talk about

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,069
building mental health projects
balancing mental health with

18
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,609
careers and life and how mental
health recovery isn't linear.

19
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,099
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

20
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,859
like we start every Virtual
Coffee. We introduce ourselves

21
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,000
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,349
in question. Today's question is
if you had to choose one

23
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,109
song for karaoke, what would it
be?

24
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey, I'm Bekah. I'm a front end
developer from a small town in

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,785
Ohio. And if I could sing one
song for karaoke, it would be

26
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:52,530
"No

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,090
Time Left For You" by The Guess
Who?

28
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,340
Dan Ott: Nice. Hi, I'm Dan. I'm
a front end developer from

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:06,000
Cleveland, Ohio. I would, if I
could sing any karaoke song, I

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
think anything about Cake is
like really in my wheelhouse.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,129
Both, you know, I like the music
and his register kind of matches

32
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,159
mine. So I think pretty much
anything by Cake. And I would

33
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,270
just see what they have and pick
one.

34
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,810
Rahat Chowdhury: Hey, I'm Rahat,
a software engineer from New

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,650
York. If I had to pick one song
for karaoke, I guess it would be

36
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:30,719
"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing".
Because I am a new dad, and I've

37
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,789
been obsessed with my daughter
for the past month. So yeah.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,710
Dan Ott: That's a good one.

39
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,439
Cameron Bardell: That's better
than what I got (laugh). I'm

40
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,999
Cameron.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,379
I'm an iOS developer from
Waterloo, Ontario. And my go-to

42
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,750
karaoke song is "Smile" by Uncle
Cracker.

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,400
Dan Ott: Nice.

44
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,520
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Awesome.
Well, thank you both for being

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,550
here. We're very excited to have
you on today to talk about

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,879
mental health tech. Both have
been working on some really cool

47
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,169
projects that we're excited to
talk about. But before we get

48
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,500
there, I always like to do a
little bit of the origin story.

49
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,819
And so can you talk about that
maybe Cameron, if you want to

50
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,449
talk first and tell us how you
got into tech and then Rahat.

51
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,289
That would be awesome.

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,449
Cameron Bardell: Sure, yeah. I
was always like, it's kind of a

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,199
techie kid. And then, but I
didn't do any real programming

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,979
until I got to high school. So I
think it was in about grade 10

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,810
when I took my first, you know,
intro to programming course,

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,310
which was

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,039
all in Python. And my, my
teacher, that course, who was a

58
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,229
really good guy who I still talk
to sometimes, he was my

59
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,689
computer science and physics
teacher in high school. And now

60
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,300
I do computer science and
physics. So you can see where

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,879
that came from. He just noticed
that I was taking a bit of extra

62
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,484
interest, then he pulled me
aside and said, would you like

63
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,089
to find

64
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,120
some extra projects to work on?
And I said, yeah. So he sent me

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,530
down to the like center for
extended learning, I think it

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,540
was called there in high school.
And they were started, got

67
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,550
started with a

68
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,395
project building Flash games and
action, and ActionScript

69
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,240
(laugh).

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,319
Educational, yeah, RAP Flash,
educational games and

71
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,374
ActionScript for students, and
that was my first, I don't know,

72
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,429
the first thing I

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,789
ever programmed that anyone else
ever looked at. And you know, I

74
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,289
just took it from there.

75
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,269
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
awesome.  I always love those

76
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,240
stories when you have good
teachers who kind of, you know,

77
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,930
notice that in you and, and
they're able to cultivate that.

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,540
Cameron Bardell: That's a big
thing what he does at that

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,084
school with me. He always like
kinda gets identifies the kids

80
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:28,628
who

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,540
are, you know, do a little extra
just because they're interested

82
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,519
in any tries to take them under
his wing. Just super great.

83
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So great.
All right. Rahat.

84
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,629
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, so I got
into tech a little bit later in

85
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,379
life, I guess. So I had a built
up a career kind of in like

86
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,319
customer support. And I was
managing customer support teams

87
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,149
at different tech startups. And
I got to like work with a lot of

88
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,120
the engineers just seeing like
different bugs kind of get fixed

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,189
whenever a customer would like
complain about things, I guess.

90
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,779
And that's what kind of got me
interested into the whole thing

91
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,290
at first. I wanted to see if I
could be the one actually fixing

92
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,329
stuff. So my wife is really
supportive. She helped me

93
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,620
through a lot of things and went
to a bootcamp and yeah, now I'm

94
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,579
doing fixing stuff.

95
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,819
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That is
awesome. I love it. And so you

96
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,459
both also have different
histories with Virtual Coffee.

97
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,930
Cameron, I feel like I've known
you forever. I remember you

98
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,470
first joining Virtual Coffee.
But I always like to ask to

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,050
you, how did you find Virtual
Coffee?

100
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,110
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. So
someone retweeted I think it was

101
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,110
in June, you guys there in
April, right? Then somebody

102
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,500
retweeted your invite link in
June. And I think I just

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,540
replied to the tweet asking you
if it was public, or if it was

104
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,430
like, kind of close thing? You
said, yeah, it's public. Come

105
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,550
join. So I did. And I've been
coming ever since then. It was

106
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,740
probably, it was really, you
know, in the midst of the

107
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,620
pandemic, and, you know, talk to
anyone that it wasn't directly

108
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,550
related to a month. It was a bit
of a savior for me.

109
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,529
Definitely one of the best
things I did in all of 2020.

110
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,800
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and
now you are, you're growing our

111
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,779
iOS, our mobile group of
developers, because people see,

112
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,729
and they come for Cameron.

113
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,105
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. I was the
only one for a long time

114
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:09,240
(laugh).

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,290
I was only one for a few months.
Now I think

116
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,589
we're up to four or five. You
know, we're still, what is

117
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,810
that? 2% of all the people who
attend (laugh), but still.

118
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,019
Dan Ott: Also a strong member of
our Canadian contingent.

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,160
Cameron Bardell: Right? Yeah.

120
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,480
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,699
Cameron Bardell: Like, I'm
meeting some niche groups.

122
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,929
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: (laugh) And
Rahat. How did you find Virtual

123
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,279
Coffee?

124
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,514
Rahat Chowdhury: Um, I think
I've seen it a couple times on

125
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,209
Twitter.

126
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,219
And I didn't join at first,
because I'm not 100% know what

127
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,989
it

128
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:47,579
was? And then I think it was
Andy, from protege.dev, told

129
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,350
me a little bit about it. And
yeah, joined in into one of the

130
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,089
meetups, I guess. And then,
yeah, from there just really

131
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,269
loved the environment and vibe.
So kept going.

132
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,579
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, nice.
I remember, I remember that

133
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,129
conversation now. Because we
were talking about working on

134
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,180
Epic React.

135
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:06,569
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah.

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,439
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And we have
a channel for that, which is not

137
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,980
that active. (laugh)

138
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,309
Rahat Chowdhury: (laugh) Came
for Epic React, stayed for

139
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,328
everything else.

140
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,180
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: There you
go. It's our new tagline.

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,639
Okay, so both of you have
projects using mental health

142
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,970
tech, and I'd love to talk a
little bit more about those. So

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,540
can you just kind of give an
overview about the projects that

144
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,529
you started?

145
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,589
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah. So
there's a couple, two things

146
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,479
that I'm

147
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,649
mainly working on. One is an
open-source project. It's called

148
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:47,040
The Sylar Project. So that is
sort of like a database of

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,600
different mental health
resources in the US. What I'm

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,110
hoping is to kind of like, get
people to help me add more and

151
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,370
more resources to it. And either
in their own states or cities.

152
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,800
So there could be like more
stuff for people to look up. The

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
reason I kind of started it is
because, you know, taking that

154
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
step into, like trying to find
help or find resources that will

155
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
help you is like a pretty big
one. And I wanted to make it as

156
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,310
easy as possible, like once you
did make that step to find

157
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,790
something that could be helpful
for you. So having it all kind

158
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,060
of like in one central place
would be, you know, probably

159
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,250
ideal for that. So yeah, I'm,
eventually I'm going to turn it

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,309
into like an API that other
developers can like, build stuff

161
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,559
off of. But for now, yeah, it's
just kind of a list. The US,

162
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,240
hopefully, maybe in more
countries soon. And yeah, the

163
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,500
thing is a startup, I'm hoping
to launch very, very soon. It's

164
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,100
called Whimser. And it's all
about cognitive-behavioral

165
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,940
therapy, and kind of like
journaling and voice note

166
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,870
journaling, and kind of getting
reminders of like, the good

167
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,929
things that happened over time
and challenging those negative

168
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,320
thoughts and stuffs.

169
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,340
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
awesome. I love that. I was

170
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,440
working on this postpartum app.
And I kind of just went into it,

171
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,220
working on it by myself. But I
reached out to a group of moms

172
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,679
and I said, like, what would you
like to see in something like

173
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,370
this? And one of the top
responses was resources for my

174
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,039
area. And I didn't have anything
about that there. But also, it

175
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,139
was really hard to find that
online, too. And so I certainly

176
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,700
think that that's really, really
valuable. Along with, you know,

177
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,669
all of the other things,
anything that can benefit mental

178
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,740
health is super important.

179
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,529
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think
there's like a lot of, I guess,

180
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,139
niches in mental health that
aren't really covered in some of

181
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,139
the general labs. So there's
definitely a lot of things that

182
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,450
we can do in this space.

183
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I feel like
I could talk about it for seven

184
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,059
hours. So try and stay focused
here. Um, Cameron, what about

185
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:03,840
your project?

186
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,629
Cameron Bardell: Sure. So my
project kind of grew out of my

187
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,450
own personal journey with mental
health, I was doing lots of

188
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,570
research on how people track
their mental health over time

189
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,929
and how you can do, there's
various different methods to

190
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,169
like check trends and mental
health, whether it's like, like

191
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:22,110
CBT, like Rahat said, or just
like doing daily journaling, or,

192
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,580
and I found that a lot of these
clinical studies use these super

193
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,250
long surveys that can take up to
like, half an hour to complete,

194
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,960
and you're supposed to do them
every day. And that's

195
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,690
exhausting. And it was a time
for that. So I dug a little more

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,480
into that, and found that those
studies who use those, I would

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,039
certainly have their place and
not saying they should be

198
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,909
replaced in anyway. But they can
often get similar results to

199
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,970
these other smaller scale
studies that use really simple

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,549
measurement systems and the one
I found that I really liked was,

201
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,320
so it's just really simple, all
you do is you get yourself, your

202
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,110
mental well being whatever is
most important to you, on a

203
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,690
scale of 1 to 10, once in the
morning, and once in the

204
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,570
evening, and you do that twice.
So you do it kind of for your

205
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,639
general overall well being, then
you pick another thing that's

206
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,889
important to you, whether
that's, you know, your sleep, or

207
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:08,490
your anxiety or your nutrition,
and you rate that in a scale of

208
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,440
1 to 10 along with your general
wellness. So you're

209
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,419
basically doing four readings a
day. Two in the morning, two in

210
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,234
the afternoon. It's super easy
to do. You, I, you know, you

211
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,049
open

212
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,269
after 10 seconds a day and do
your reading, and then you go

213
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,700
about with your day. So I
started building an app for

214
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,299
that. And I've had to kind of
shell that a little bit because

215
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,179
I recently started a new full
time job, hoping to get back to

216
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,639
it soon. But yeah, I think a lot
of the solutions out there

217
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,729
really intensive and
time-consuming. And you're meant

218
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,439
to

219
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
open the app and kind of spend
some time in there. But I think,

220
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,320
you know, the goal for my app
would be to spend as little time

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,980
in it as possible.

222
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
like that approach. Some of

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,685
those, you, you look at in it,
it's so complicated, it that it,

224
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,370
it's an

225
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,330
automatic like, I'm done. I'm
not gonna sit here and go

226
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,509
through all of these things. And
watch all of your screens give

227
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,309
me messages and positive things
like I want to feel where I

228
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,109
wanna go.

229
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,299
Cameron Bardell: It feels like
you're supposed to live in the

230
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,730
app, sometimes. Like they have
common videos to watch, and you

231
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,519
know, like maybe guided
meditations, or some of them are

232
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,220
like gamified, where you can
like earn awards and stuff. And

233
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,710
sure, yeah, those work for tons
of people get great reviews and

234
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,359
works a lot. But it doesn't work
for me (laugh). I want to, you

235
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,008
know, I

236
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,009
want to spend as little time
thinking about it. So, and there

237
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,299
was no solution out there. So I
built it.

238
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,039
Dan Ott: That's awesome. I was
going to say something about

239
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,699
the,

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,639
oh, the cognitive therapy, yeah.
Rahat, you had mentioned that

241
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,624
with your, with your startup
that you're working on. The,

242
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,609
that area

243
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,509
of like therapy has been very
interesting to me. And at some

244
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,474
times, it's been successful, but
a lot of it with, I mean

245
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,439
personally,

246
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,150
when, I mean it's just my
personal experience, my problem

247
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,860
with it

248
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,509
is sort of getting myself to do
anything about it. And this is

249
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,029
sort of applies to what Cameron
was saying to you. But like, the

250
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,470
exercises that a therapist
would, would give me would be,

251
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,820
you

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,519
know, these things that I have
to both remember how to do,

253
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,509
remember to do them, and then
also, I don't know, do them at

254
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:08,700
the right way, or whatever. Or
maybe there isn't like a right

255
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,149
way. But it's like there's full
of doubt, you know, like,

256
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,600
wondering if I'm doing it the
right way or not. So I was, I

257
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,220
was

258
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,610
wondering if there's, if you
have some plans with cognitive

259
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,750
therapy, like specifically
about, you know, I don't know.

260
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,389
About how to approach like, sort
of things like that?

261
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,149
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think
in our case, probably, cognitive

262
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,299
behavioral therapy is probably
just kind of in the MVP, or the

263
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,864
beginning stages. What we're
kind of planning to do is like,

264
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,429
have it

265
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,690
be a little bit of a guided sort
of prompt thing, but hopefully,

266
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,929
with not too many prompts, like
Cameron mentioned, which is

267
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,289
definitely an issue in a lot of
apps. So it's kind of like,

268
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,929
choose your emotion. You can
write down something, record

269
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,039
something and be done with that.
Or if you want to, like, get

270
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,740
more insight onto things and
challenge some of your thoughts.

271
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,769
It'll then take you on, like,
guided like two more questions

272
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,829
of like, what's a cognitive,
like a cognitive behavioral

273
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,859
distortion

274
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
that you're facing right now.
Gives you some info about what

275
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,080
those are, and asks you to kind
of challenge the thought in some

276
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,915
way. And, you know, if, and
that, that journey, I think is

277
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:24,750
more

278
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,059
optional. And sort of like, if
you just want to record, record

279
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,240
yourself an event, it's kind of
like, that's an option too.

280
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,840
And if you do want more, more of
that info and more like, I guess

281
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,100
more deeper CBT stuff, then it's
a little bit guided scope and

282
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,200
more questions on that. Our
eventual hope is that the app

283
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,379
kind of becomes a sort of like a
custom journey based on like

284
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,450
your work with like your
therapist or psychiatrist, or

285
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,289
whoever. We're hoping that like
health professionals can like

286
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,584
prescribe a journey for the app
that's tailored towards the

287
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,789
user.

288
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,160
Dan Ott: That's really
interesting. Yeah, that, I

289
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,570
hadn't

290
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,490
really thought about, I mean,
they don't always like, there's

291
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,440
a lot of apps out there. But not
always connected, you know, to

292
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,955
like, to therapy, right? And
it's kind of okay, therapy is

293
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:22,320
either

294
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,559
not doing it for me or, you
know, something like that. And

295
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,889
people are kind of going on
their own to like, onto the App

296
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,700
Store, you know?

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,909
Rahat Chowdhury: I think CBT
definitely doesn't work for

298
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:37,190
everybody. So, yeah, our goal is
just to like, while we're

299
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,509
starting there, we just want to
figure out like, something easy

300
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,559
and simple for people to do that
is helpful for them. And just

301
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,980
based on stuff that an actual
therapist would recommend for

302
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,690
them to do on their own time.

303
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:51,919
Cameron Bardell: Like Rahat said
earlier, there's tons of room in

304
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,669
the

305
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,129
space very, like very individual
responses. I mean, that's the

306
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,629
whole problem with mental
health. It's the problem and

307
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,159
the solution, I guess. Is that
it's so varied for an

308
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,689
individual,

309
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,600
for everyone. So yeah, there's
just tons of different ways to

310
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,720
build tools like this. And each
I know, part of figuring out how

311
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
to control your own mental
health is you might have to try

312
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,870
a lot of these different things,
and most of them won't work. And

313
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,235
that's really hard and
frustrating. But, you know, it's

314
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,600
part of

315
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,929
the journey.

316
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,409
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and I
think, you know, they're all

317
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,799
valuable. Because everybody
approaches it a different way.

318
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,309
And I think that technology is
really changing the face of how

319
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,330
we view mental health. I mean,
even openness to talking about

320
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,990
it, and having these
conversations. I know like in

321
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,889
my mental health journey, it
would not be nearly as

322
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,850
productive as it was if I didn't
talk to other people who

323
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,049
I never would have met on, if I
weren't on Twitter, or online,

324
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,830
or whatever, you know? So
hearing other people's stories

325
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,210
kind of guided my journey and
where I was going, but it looks

326
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,360
different for every person. And
the more we learn about it, I

327
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,049
think using technology also
helps us better identify the

328
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,140
problems and the solutions that
will work for different people.

329
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,868
Cameron Bardell: And the good
thing about using technology for

330
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,969
that kind of things, it's
impartial. Like a big part of

331
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,364
the reason why I built what I
built is that like uncompress

332
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,759
new

333
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,489
things and graphs and numbers.
And so I wanted to see like,

334
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:18,509
kind of the true history of, of
what I was feeling. And so I

335
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,638
looked, and when I was doing
this research, I found out that

336
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,179
there's a lot of studies that
show that if you ask people how

337
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,788
they're feeling, at a certain
time, and on a scale of 1 to

338
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,818
10 like I said, like say, they
get a text and they have to say

339
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,308
how do I feel right now? And,
and you do that multiple times,

340
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,448
maybe throughout a day, or
throughout the week, and then

341
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:34,588
you ask them

342
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,528
later on, looking back, how did
you feel on average in total?

343
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,078
Those two numbers almost never
lined up. How people say they

344
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:41,758
feel at the moment is not how
they say they felt later

345
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:43,438
(laugh). So

346
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,868
that was one of, of another one
reasons why I made this thing

347
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:48,388
that you have to do. Well you
don't have to, you can do it

348
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,548
as many times as you want. But
you know, ideally twice a day,

349
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:54,179
and you do it right in the
moment really quickly. It's just

350
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,189
really important to have that
kind of self-knowledge and be

351
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,739
able to look back and see things
trending up or down in different

352
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,439
directions. Like my app doesn't
offer any kind of therapy or any

353
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,648
information other than what you
give it. It's just, it's just a

354
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,338
personal record.

355
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:08,578
Dan Ott: Yeah. That's really
cool.

356
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,049
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I,
Cameron, I wanted to talk about

357
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,599
something that you said in Slack
the other day, too. I

358
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,920
think it was somewhere near you
is trying to help people feel

359
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,509
connected during the time of the
pandemic. And I'm always, you

360
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:28,170
know, found that community is
the most important part of

361
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,430
growing through mental health
challenges. Can you just talk a

362
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,660
little bit about what they were
doing there? Because I found it

363
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,369
like, this really kind of
simple, but beautiful way of

364
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,450
connecting people.

365
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,609
Cameron Bardell: Yeah, that was
a really interesting project.

366
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,420
Um, so it's called, I go to
University of Waterloo, which

367
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,529
is, like common engineering and
science-based school in Ontario.

368
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,680
And so I just saw on Twitter
that a couple of engineering

369
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,420
students put together this
project, and it's basically a

370
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,049
heat map of the university
campus and where people report

371
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,170
they've cried on campus, which
sounds kind of funny. I think

372
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,359
it's really interesting because
their, their stated goal is just

373
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,839
to show people, like when you
get, you know, into kind of

374
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,789
worked up emotional state like
that, I think it's really normal

375
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,680
to kind of want to hide
yourself, you know, you want to

376
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,470
make, you want to go be alone
somewhere, and you kind of

377
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,049
experienced that on your own.
But, yeah, they just put

378
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,829
together this map just to show
that, you know, if you've done

379
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,559
it, if you're struggling with
it, then someone else's too. And

380
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,750
they've got it's a heat map,
like I said. And then there's

381
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,359
also just kind of some people
did more personalized stories.

382
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,430
So I thought that was a really
interesting project, especially

383
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,410
during a pandemic and we're all
more isolated than ever.

384
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,459
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, that
idea of, of connecting people

385
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,809
is,

386
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,250
is really important. I think
that, you know, you do sometimes

387
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,019
get in that moment where you
think like, well, I'm the only

388
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,900
one that feels this way. But
just like having a simple visual

389
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,710
of like, oh, I cried, but look
at somebody right over there did

390
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,160
too.

391
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,200
Cameron Bardell: I'm looking at
the map right now and I'm like,

392
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,660
oh look, at the engineering
building. I've had long nights

393
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,980
there too. (laugh)

394
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,990
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
think that's really, really

395
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,610
great. Okay, so I would love,
you talked a little bit about,

396
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,230
you

397
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,099
know, how you kind of got into
pursuing these. So it sounds

398
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,519
like for both of you, there's
some type of personal component

399
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,509
to this. And I'd love to know,
or if you are up for talking a

400
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,170
little bit more about, like the
inspiration behind this. And if

401
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,009
you learned anything new about
yourself, or, you know, what you

402
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:30,059
were doing through, through this
journey, that would be awesome.

403
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,390
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think,
for me, so the idea for this

404
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,399
kind came out of like, some of
my own personal experiences.

405
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,348
Going to

406
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,519
therapy, trying to take care of
my own mental health and all

407
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:52,859
that. And, like, the one of the
main things was like, therapy is

408
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,480
helpful. But it's only 45
minutes, once or twice a month,

409
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,349
or every other week, or
something like that. And there's

410
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,430
all this other time in between,
where just like, I, I'm not

411
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,259
sure, sometimes, like, I guess,
how to take care of myself for,

412
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,990
you know, try to, I guess, make
my mental health better in some

413
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,980
way. So that was like a large
part of the conversation that I

414
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
was having with my therapist.
And she would give me like

415
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,630
different prompts and stuff. And
like, sort of like CBT based

416
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,549
things to try out on my own is
writing stuff out. And it was

417
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,049
pretty helpful. And the thing
that I realized was really

418
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,380
helpful for me was like, when I
in those moments, when I was

419
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,400
able to remember back to like, a
positive thing, kind of related

420
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,279
to whatever I was doing. Like,
if, like, if I was having a

421
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,420
crap day at work, but then
thinking about another time

422
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,180
where, you know, something went
right at work, that was

423
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,029
sometimes pretty helpful. So
that was kind of like a lot of

424
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,839
the basis for the app itself of
like, having some positive

425
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,700
reinforcement in those negative
times.

426
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,519
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's really
cool. I have, I also have

427
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,229
trouble

428
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,049
with it. The connection between
like, different appointments and

429
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,420
and just sort of everything, it
seems to make sense, you know,

430
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,529
when you walk out of an
appointment, and then a week

431
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,209
later, you're like, I don't
(laugh), I don't know. I don't

432
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,889
know what

433
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,945
I'm doing. I don't know, you
know? Like, all the, all that

434
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,000
stuff. I

435
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,660
guess a place where like
technology can, you know, like,

436
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,480
really shine? I think if you
know, if applied correctly.

437
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,299
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Cameron, I
don't know, if you want to

438
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,710
share. You don't have to, but

439
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,089
Cameron Bardell: Yeah, no,
totally. Yeah, part of my like,

440
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,369
journey with my personal mental
health, I guess, I started

441
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,059
struggling with anxiety in my
pre early teens, and kind of

442
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:51,039
kept them to myself for a long
time. So like, I feel like most

443
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
of the last several years for me
has been a process of opening

444
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,859
it up to slowly, like, wider and
wider circle of people. So it

445
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,140
started eventually, like, you
know, talking to my parents, and

446
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,140
then they helped me a lot. And
then you know, from there, I was

447
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,759
like, okay, that worked out
pretty well. And then I, you

448
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,650
know, started talking to a
doctor, and then I do even more.

449
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,839
I said, wow. This seems to be a
trend (laugh) if there's

450
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,669
anything. So then, you know, you

451
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,250
start opening up to a wider
circle of people. So my friends,

452
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,250
you know, you guys eventually.
And now here I am on a podcast

453
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,680
talking about it. That's been a
really important part of the

454
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,650
process for me. We have a Slack
channel in, in Virtual Coffee,

455
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,740
where we talk about these sorts
of things. And, you know, people

456
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,079
have been, you know, pretty
open. And, you know, not

457
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,979
everyone has to be open, and
just something that happens to

458
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:27,879
help

459
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,410
me personally. I would never say
that, like, I don't even know

460
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,440
how to phrase this. Like, I
would never tell anyone that

461
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,569
they should go and talk about
their experiences, because it

462
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,099
will definitely help, you know,
it might not (laugh). Depends.

463
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,629
It just

464
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,024
happened to help out for me. And
I only came to that realization

465
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:43,298
after

466
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,839
like several years of
struggling. So yeah. That's,

467
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,779
that's kind of been an ongoing
thing for me.

468
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,369
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's actually
been a trend we've noticed with

469
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,559
Virtual Coffee. And not just
with mental health, although

470
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,849
definitely with mental health,
and even just being becoming a

471
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:04,619
developer or learning, finding,
you know, finding a job, all of

472
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,640
these things that, over and over
again, we have people that come

473
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,519
in or just feel alone, you know,
feel like they're the only

474
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,650
ones are feeling something's
wrong with them that because

475
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,400
they are struggling finding a
job or struggling learning, you

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,490
know? Anything. Learning
anything in tech and is or

477
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,080
struggling with, you know,
mental health things and finding

478
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,670
other

479
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,410
people that are also, you know,
going through a lot of the same

480
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,150
things.

481
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,490
Cameron Bardell: And I would
encourage you to say like, you

482
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,289
don't even have to say anything

483
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,569
when you're in these spaces.
Like you can just go and be a

484
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:35,549
lurker until you feel
comfortable. I mean, you'll

485
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:37,500
never feel comfortable sharing
yourself that you can go and see

486
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,794
what other people are saying,
you know, maybe that's something

487
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:44,039
that

488
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,149
could help. Like, that includes
like, you know, mental health

489
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:46,289
stuff in

490
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,630
the job search and I know
Bekah's been and several other

491
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,549
people in the Slack've been
leading the way on like a

492
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,039
neuro-diversity channel, which
is really great to see. So all

493
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,750
those kinds of things. You can,
you can reach out and find these

494
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,420
spaces and you don't have to be
sure if it's right for you to

495
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,880
share. You can definitely kind
of hang out for a while and it's

496
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,805
take your bearings, and maybe
decided that it's not for you,

497
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,190
and

498
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,569
that's okay, too. But yeah, you
don't have to feel pressured to

499
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,569
say anything.

500
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,349
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think a
pretty good other benefit that

501
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,599
comes from that is like, just
knowing that you're not alone,

502
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,730
sort of. There's other people
kind of like going through

503
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,180
similar stuff. I think there's
definitely just like powering

504
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,730
as like not feeling as alone.
Like, for me, especially when I

505
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,220
start doing talks on it, and
kind of like openly talking

506
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,759
about it, so like, other people
responding by like, hey,

507
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,874
I, you know, I go through this
kind of similar stuff, too. It's

508
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,659
just

509
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:36,269
like, it was kind, maybe not, I
don't know, good is the right

510
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:40,680
word to say, but more like just,
it doesn't feel as bad

511
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,619
going through it, knowing that
you're not going through it by

512
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,220
yourself.

513
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,049
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: For sure.

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,960
Cameron Bardell: It kinda like,
it kind of shows how like, the

515
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,920
progress

516
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,309
isn't linear, either. Like it's
normal and honestly in some

517
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,039
ways, kind of important to have
back slides. And then, and then

518
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,170
show yourself that you can get
through them, you know? If you

519
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,970
feel like you've made progress,
and then you revert back for a

520
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,470
little bit, that's a normal part
of the process. And you

521
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,690
shouldn't, you know, something
that I like to say is you

522
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,940
shouldn't feel bad about feeling
bad. Like, you don't have to

523
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,950
beat yourself up over your lack
of progress over thing, you

524
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,960
know, any of these

525
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,329
areas. So again, it's, the
recovery, like showing you that

526
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,309
you have, showing yourself that
you have the strength to recover

527
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,079
from something like that is
really important as well.

528
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,119
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I,
um, so my journey into tech

529
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,219
started

530
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,009
with a trauma that I went
through. And so I talked a lot

531
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,990
about it about having anxiety,
depression, PTSD, but like one

532
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,559
of the most pivotal moments for
me was when I was in bootcamp,

533
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:39,230
my educational coach, who was
assigned to me and she said,

534
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,380
hey, can I share a story with
you? I said, sure. And she said,

535
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,309
I went through trauma, too. I
was run over by a semi truck.

536
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,099
And that was the first person I
had ever talked to about

537
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,089
trauma. And our traumas were
very, very different. But all of

538
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,970
the words that she were saying,
they were the words that had

539
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,599
gone through my head so many
times. And I finally realized

540
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,519
that I wasn't alone. So I had
spent so much time alone in, in

541
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,079
that, that, that just moment of
connection was enough to like,

542
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,269
give me hope to keep going. And
that was, my trauma was four

543
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:18,920
years ago. And I gave a talk
about it the other day. Told the

544
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,759
story many, many times. And I
just started crying and I don't

545
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,709
ever cry. So it was like on a
screen full of people, just

546
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,659
crying.

547
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,509
Couldn't get it, couldn't get it
together. And it was that

548
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:32,119
feeling of like being super
frustrated at myself. Like why,

549
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,979
why is this happening now? And
the talk, that's recorded.

550
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,808
That's

551
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:37,879
gonna be on YouTube, right? And
so like I wrote a little post on

552
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,949
my

553
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,819
trauma blog about it. And
somebody messaged me, and she

554
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:47,900
said, this is what I needed to
hear in this moment, because she

555
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,650
had also gone through a trauma
in a couple of years ago. And

556
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,789
suddenly, she was like, hit with
that moment, too. And just felt

557
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,329
like very frustrated with
herself. And so it exactly what

558
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,390
you're saying, Cameron. It's
like, it's not linear, right?

559
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,759
Like, there's gonna be waves and
somebody once said, like, it

560
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,420
doesn't go away, but it gets
different. And I think that, you

561
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,660
know, that might be specific to
trauma. But, you know, we find

562
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,690
these moments in our lives,
where we're like, man, I really

563
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,410
thought that I was passed this.
And that can be hard. But when

564
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,529
you connect with somebody else,
and you can kind of talk about

565
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,440
it together, then you realize,
like, okay, you know, like, we

566
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,970
we've got this together.

567
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,759
Cameron Bardell: It can be
helpful, too, if you've been,

568
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,334
like you said, you've kind of,
you hear your own words in your

569
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,909
head so much. And

570
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,519
maybe you don't know if it makes
sense. Because these things can

571
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,049
often be really hard to put
words to, because it's not

572
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,859
something that necessarily has
like a physical analogy for

573
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,140
everyone. So if you can, like
kind of, say these words out

574
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,390
loud, and someone says, yeah,
no, that makes sense. That makes

575
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,210
you feel a little less, I don't
know, lost sometimes. So.

576
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:55,979
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, also,
I think, you know, if we're

577
00:28:55,979 --> 00:29:00,898
talking technology too,
sometimes, sometimes you can

578
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,338
deny things to yourself, right?
But if the data is in front of

579
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:09,028
you, like, okay, I've been
tracking my mood for this long,

580
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:12,268
for the last, however much time.
Maybe, maybe I'm not being

581
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:15,508
honest

582
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:21,388
with myself about how bad I feel
right now. Or good. Maybe you

583
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:22,169
feel good, hopefully. (laugh)

584
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,549
Cameron Bardell: People aren't
good at, um like, I don't know,

585
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,230
maybe you're not, it's not that
you're not being honest with

586
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,100
yourself. People just aren't
really that good at

587
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,970
self-evaluation.

588
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,589
It's just how human brains work.
So it's not, it's not

589
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,259
necessarily like intentional or
otherwise, like deluding

590
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,420
yourself or lying to yourself,
or whatever you want to call it.

591
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,759
It's just not an easy, normal
thing to do.

592
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,160
Dan Ott: Mm hmm. Yeah. And that
kind of circles back to some of

593
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,000
the cognitive behavioral therapy
stuff is your brain like, will

594
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,610
actually actively lie to you
about al of things. Is, yeah,

595
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,220
well,

596
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:58,769
like we said at the beginning,
we could probably all talk about

597
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:01,649
this for (laugh) a long, long,
long time. Kind of moving,

598
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,529
moving on.

599
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,910
So you're both pretty busy, you
have a lot of side projects

600
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,690
going on and along with, you
know, career stuff and family

601
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,910
stuff, school. So we were
wondering how each of you sort

602
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,665
of balance your, your own mental
health, like with, with work,

603
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,420
and

604
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,560
with side projects, and
everything else that goes along

605
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,700
with being,

606
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,829
you know, a human in the, you
know, in 2021. Rahat, we'll

607
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,529
start with you. At a talk, one
of our lightning talks last

608
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,220
year was sort of about some of
this. So, I start with you, and

609
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,480
see what your thoughts were.

610
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:41,069
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, for me, I
tend to forget a lot of times to

611
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:44,670
really stop and just like, not
work on all the different things

612
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,759
I'm working on for a little bit.
So the way I've recently been

613
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,369
managing it is just like, trying
to remember that, you know, I

614
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,910
have a daughter now. I need some
time for her, I need some time

615
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,160
for myself, I need some time to
just like unwind from

616
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,529
everything, because there is a
ton of stuff I'm doing right

617
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:12,690
now. And it took, it takes a lot
of work for me to like, get past

618
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,119
my own, I guess, self-imposed
deadlines on things that don't

619
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,900
actually mean anything. And the
way I had sort of tried to

620
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:29,579
accept a little exercise I do
just in my head is like pretend

621
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:32,279
that like I'm a stakeholder in a
meeting, and I'm like pushing

622
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,710
the state back a little bit
like, hey, we don't need it till

623
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,050
this time. That's kinda, that's
something that kinda works for

624
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,390
me a little

625
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,890
bit. And then those moments,
I'll try to let go and like

626
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,140
just take a walk or play some
video games, anything like

627
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,250
that, and just try to get away
from what I'm working on. And

628
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,609
just like, also trying to remind
myself that if I wanna work

629
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:00,059
quickly through things, then I
need to take a break. Because

630
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,480
I've like gone through burnout
before, like, not being able to

631
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,950
do something for a couple
months. And just kind of like

632
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,945
getting it down in my head and
it was like, if I don't stop

633
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,940
sometimes, and just

634
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,920
like take a breath, I won't be
able to continue doing as much

635
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:18,329
stuff as I hope to do.

636
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,119
Dan Ott: Yeah, totally. I think
that's, I mean, we've sort of

637
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,240
talked about this before, but I
think that, that's like a great,

638
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:32,789
a great thing to do consciously
is sort of try to jam, like not

639
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,680
jam those breaks into your
schedule, but like actually

640
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,259
schedule, you know, breaks in
and make sure you're taking care

641
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,619
of them. Cameron, do you have
anything like, I don't know,

642
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,525
specific thing you do, to try
to, you know, take care of

643
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:43,920
yourself

644
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,464
or, you know, getting everything
done. And, you know, side

645
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,008
project thing and all that?

646
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,019
Cameron Bardell: Yeah,
[unintelligible], I guess. I'm

647
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:49,679
coming out with a bit of a

648
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,779
period where I've like been
bouncing around on a lot of

649
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,359
different things. Because about
a year ago, for a long time, I

650
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,880
was kind of torn between whether
I would do like science and

651
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,220
research or just go into tech.
And about a year ago, I finally

652
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,150
decided, okay, tech can be the
thing. So at that point, I

653
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,519
started doing like a bunch more
freelancing and did a couple

654
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,710
internships and side projects
and stuff, so it was like, okay.

655
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,120
Here's what I need to do again
to get into the tech industry.

656
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,500
And

657
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,599
then, you know, a couple weeks
ago, I just got hired full time.

658
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,690
So then that period of like
doing a whole bunch of stuff and

659
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,059
bouncing around is kind of
settling down now. So in back,

660
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,099
it's like reevaluating and
focusing on, okay, here's the

661
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,309
main things I need to do. Like,
I need to do like this much.

662
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,799
Well, I need to work, you know,
40 hours a week, and I need to

663
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,579
do this much school, and then I
also need to exercise. So I've

664
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,940
been coming out of kind of a
chaotic period and settling into

665
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,710
more of a routine the past few
weeks, which isn't really nice

666
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,480
(laugh).

667
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,019
Yeah, but I still think that,
that period of working hard was

668
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,534
important, because I ended up,
you know, in a place that I

669
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,049
really wanted to

670
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,509
get. And yeah, it was hard for a
while. But here I am.

671
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,499
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think,
too, when you can see, this

672
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,308
isn't a forever thing, there,
this is going to end then it

673
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,638
makes it feel a little bit more
doable. But there's also this,

674
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,479
like natural tendency in tech. I
think tech just moves so

675
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,528
quickly, right? That people feel
this, this need to hustle all

676
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:07,558
the time. And that's like, I
can't stand that word, hustle.

677
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:13,528
But like to continue to keep
doing stuff all the time. And I

678
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:17,938
find that as much as I don't
like that word, I have a really

679
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:21,599
hard time turning off my brain
when there's always something to

680
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,163
be done because, you know, like,
tech moves fast and so do

681
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,727
people.

682
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:27,239
So, (laugh)

683
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,640
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. I really
kind of like, it's kind of a

684
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,780
strong

685
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,960
word, but I kind of detest that
part of Twitter's like, I don't

686
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,929
know. Silicon Valley, like VC
hustle porn kind of like, if

687
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,744
you're not working you're losing
money. I don't know. Everyone

688
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,559
should be the

689
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,570
founder kind of thing which is
not true. Not everyone should be

690
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,064
a founder. Being a founder kind
of sucks (laugh). Yeah. And,

691
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:49,558
yeah, I don't

692
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,030
know. I just like, what you said
about having a deadline was,

693
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,484
was really stood out to me
because yeah, like I had, so

694
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,909
when

695
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,280
I made the decision to go into
tech, I had a year and a half

696
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,449
left in my degree. And I was
like, okay, so I'm going to work

697
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,618
really hard for

698
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,780
this next year and a half, and
then I'm going to be settled

699
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,389
into a career hopefully. And
having that deadline really

700
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,639
helped. And then when I got
hired full time, I had four

701
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,219
months left in my undergrad
degree. So just to make the full

702
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:12,689
time work, I stretched that out
into eight months. So starting,

703
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:14,159
you

704
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,509
know, in August, I'll be done
with school and just working.

705
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:16,859
And

706
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,400
then I feel like then, you know,
like I said, even now, I'm

707
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
working less hard than I was
three or four months ago, but

708
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,820
even past the summer, I'll be
pretty fully settled in just

709
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,929
having that in mind really
helps.

710
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,440
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and I
know Rahat too, you have been

711
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,039
working on a book. And at some
point, you tweeted that you were

712
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,889
talking about like building a
mental health breaks, which I

713
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:42,239
just really loved that idea.
Because we're always focusing on

714
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,469
like, you've got to learn,
you've got to learn fast,

715
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:44,699
bootcamps

716
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,940
are moving people through
quickly, everybody's looking for

717
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,739
jobs. And that idea of like,
okay, you can learn, but let's

718
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,099
pause and take care of you. And
I just found that concept

719
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,349
really, really fascinating. Are
you, is that make it, does it,

720
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,599
did

721
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,954
it make a place in, does it have
a place, oh my gosh. Does that

722
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,309
have,

723
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:06,570
did, I can't do it (laugh).

724
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,559
Dan Ott: (laugh) Is that in your
book?

725
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,509
Rahat Chowdhury: (laugh) Yeah.
So I've definitely built it into

726
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,678
the chapters

727
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,909
I've been writing recently. Like
at the end, depending on like

728
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,329
what subject I cover in that
specific chapter, like, there's

729
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,869
one where talking about like,
trying to find other people

730
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,239
similar, like in the same
journey as you are going into

731
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,099
tech and seeing like, you know,
if you can band together to work

732
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,340
on some stuff. And at the end, I
kind of like, I want to have

733
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,619
like a sort of like a norm-,
kind of like an alert box type

734
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,530
thing at the end of like, hey,
you know, reaching out to people

735
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:51,900
can be hard. Talking to people
is pretty hard. Especially if

736
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,849
you're like me, have some social
anxiety and stuff. And, you

737
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,659
know, if you've talked to a
couple people, great. You don't

738
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:03,900
have to keep doing it. Take a
break, just remember to take

739
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,780
care of yourself stuff like
that. And that, there's a little

740
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,929
like alerts, like at the end of
each chapter like that, based on

741
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:12,599
whatever we covered. It's just
like, it's awesome that you're

742
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,869
doing this, but you should also
be taking care of yourself as

743
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:16,170
well.

744
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,380
Dan Ott: That's really cool.

745
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,789
Cameron Bardell: Now that I
remember what Bekah said, sorry,

746
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:22,879
just to jump in quick. Bekah
said something that stood out to

747
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:23,969
me.

748
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,199
I guess it's like these
bootcamps and online, different

749
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,429
online, you know,

750
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,785
learning platforms, whether it's
Udemy, or like something

751
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:29,940
self-directed

752
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,219
like that, they kind of try to
push you through, like

753
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,619
you said, and finish quickly.
And that's, they present it in

754
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,019
ways if that's good for you, and
it's not as good to them, then

755
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,639
they can get more people in
(laugh) and charge more people

756
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,259
more money.

757
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,420
So yeah, of course, they have to
present that in a way that makes

758
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,170
it seem like it's for you, but
it's not.

759
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,070
Dan Ott: Yeah, it seem, that's
actually, that's an interesting

760
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,369
point. And in the bootcamps,
from what I've heard, it seems

761
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,130
like they're either in a like,
kind of class, like they're

762
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,159
where people are pushing and
pushing, or it's either that,

763
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,394
or you're in the self-guided
path. And it, from what I've

764
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:00,629
heard, and

765
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,789
I don't have full experience
with this, but from what I've

766
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,119
heard, it's sort of like very
much on your own in a point, you

767
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,909
know? And so you can go, try to
go faster, or you go slow, or

768
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:11,309
you lost or whatever, but you're
sort of like drifting off on

769
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:13,574
your own. I think, yeah,
getting, getting some, some of

770
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,839
that

771
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,690
thought into learning, like
learning materials and learning,

772
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,869
you know, courses and programs.
It seems very important. A lot,

773
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,590
a lot of people struggling in
bootcamps. From what I've

774
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,420
learned over the last, over the
last year.

775
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,254
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think
that's definitely like a culture

776
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:34,199
and a

777
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,360
lot of bootcamps that needs to
change. Because, yeah, we're

778
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,019
just kind of pushing and pushing
and not reminding people to just

779
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,110
take a break. Like, I also do,
I'm a TA at a bootcamp,

780
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,170
part-time.

781
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,530
And like, one of my students was
asking me, like,

782
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,735
how do I get better at
JavaScript? How do I like, do

783
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,460
more stuff to,

784
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,139
you know, keep, keep building. I
tried to work on things every

785
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,449
single day, for X amount of
hours. And I'm just like, take a

786
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,969
break sometimes, and just let
the information kind of sink in.

787
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Because sometimes you just need
to walk away from it to like,

788
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,710
let yourself absorb it.
Sometimes just like walking away

789
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,869
is like one of the best things
you can do to like, solve a

790
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,019
problem. Like there's countless
sign I think a lot of people

791
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:24,599
talking about it of like, you
know, you're going through

792
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,179
trying to fix a bug, you don't
know what's going on, you walk

793
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:30,360
away, you come back and you know
what's going on now. Because you

794
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,750
need to refresh or you need to
just like step away sometimes.

795
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,550
Dan Ott: Absolutely.

796
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,230
Cameron Bardell: Yeah.
Motivation is like a finite

797
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,769
resource (laugh).

798
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,780
Dan Ott: Yeah, yeah. I feel like
that, that go take a walk is, is

799
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,829
gotta be like, when people are
having a, you know, when people

800
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:49,079
are like, I can't figure this
thing out, you know, it's like,

801
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,239
when you're doing tech support,
you need the first question is,

802
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,694
when did you turn it off and
turn it back on again, right?

803
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,149
And so

804
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,869
when you do like bug support,
you're like, okay, did you, did

805
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:59,670
you take a walk? Have you
stepped away from the computer,

806
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,710
yet? (laugh) Step away from the
computer and come back. And then

807
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,750
let's

808
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,010
see if you're still having the
same problem (laugh).

809
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,360
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's so
hard to, I think, in bootcamps,

810
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:12,659
there's that sense of loneliness
and lack of community,

811
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,949
especially for online bootcamps
with self-paced students that

812
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:20,760
don't prioritize community. And
then you, you find that problem.

813
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,579
So you can take a walk and come
back and have nobody to ask,

814
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,519
right? And so that's like,
bootcamps come with built-in

815
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,439
loneliness, like, I don't know,
that needs to be (laugh)

816
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,359
advertised or

817
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,900
something.

818
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:35,099
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. Meg, in
our Slack at VC, Meg was talking

819
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,779
about that a lot. How she's
doing the self-guided bootcamp.

820
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:38,459
And that she can't

821
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,800
do it as fast as some of her
peers because she's working at

822
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,380
the same time. So she's kind of
fell behind like the people she

823
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,929
started with just for lack of
time. And then I think that

824
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:48,239
contributed to some of your
dissatisfaction.

825
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,429
Dan Ott: Yeah, absolutely. Um,
she's one of the people I was

826
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,440
thinking about. Marie was, while
she was on the podcast a couple

827
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,300
episodes ago, but was talking
about, she did a, like the

828
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,090
scheduled one, right? But they
didn't have a lot of support.

829
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,340
And she was struggling. And so
she basically strong armchair

830
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,820
class into doing study groups.
And they all found it, you know,

831
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,170
I mean, they all found it very
valuable, you know? But it was

832
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,250
not a program thing, you know?
It was, it was Marie, doing it,

833
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,500
because she wanted the support.
And it turned out other people,

834
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,610
you know, found it valuable,
too.

835
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,184
Cameron Bardell: It's the same
way I pass like undergrad.

836
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,459
(laugh) Just

837
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,849
having groups of people to study
with, um, you know, that went

838
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,769
away for a lot of people in the
pandemic, and I can't imagine

839
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,079
what it would have been like, as
the first year you're going into

840
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,459
do that, you know. And the only
way I passed, you know, second

841
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,839
year

842
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,249
calculus is because I was doing
it with a group of friends

843
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,658
(laugh). So

844
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,309
yeah, I definitely feel bad for
those people.

845
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,750
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was
talking to a mom recently, and I

846
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,265
don't remember she's going
through a bootcamp or a

847
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,780
self-taught,

848
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,519
she's doing like a guided, can't
talk today (laugh). Can't

849
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,829
remember if she is self-taught
or doing a bootcamp. But one of

850
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,369
the things she was saying was,
it's just so hard to find time,

851
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,579
you know, a lot of moms are at
home with kids right now

852
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,909
because of the pandemic, and
there's no childcare. And so

853
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,599
she's saying, yeah, you know,
like, I guide my students do

854
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,969
their schoolwork all day, and
then I stay up from like, 12:30

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,199
until 3:30, and then I've got to
get up at 7, you know, and

856
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,760
it's like, okay. Let, let's
break this down a little bit and

857
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,969
figure out something that's,
that's doable, and maintainable,

858
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:35,130
and that allows you to get rest.
Because a rested brain is going

859
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,550
to absorb the material more.
But, you know, there's this

860
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:44,039
pressure to continue to go all
the time, despite everything

861
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,000
else. And you, I don't know, you
can't really strong-arm your way

862
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,260
through, well, I was gonna say
through, through lack of sleep,

863
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,955
but parenthood that kind of
makes you do that. So maybe you

864
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,650
can (laugh)

865
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,664
Dan Ott: (laugh) Anyway that
also, you know, confirms that

866
00:42:58,664 --> 00:42:59,879
it's not a good

867
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,530
idea by the end of the choices
you're making after four weeks

868
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:11,159
of not sleeping. It's good stuff
though (laugh).

869
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So I've
been doing like a deep dive into

870
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,980
deep learning and mental health.
And I've been like, very, very

871
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,300
fascinated by all of the
different ways that they are

872
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:31,110
approaching mental health with
technology and how I think

873
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:38,309
that's gonna provide more
individualistic care for, for

874
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:42,360
people and address like, I
think, you know, really

875
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,010
understanding what mental health
looks like. And so I think that

876
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,829
that's really exciting. But I
also feel like, you know,

877
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,039
there's this, this tendency,
like, I'm so excited about this

878
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,480
thing, but you're gonna have to
wait forever for it to come out

879
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,660
and to apply, to apply it to
your own life. But I think that,

880
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,840
you

881
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,159
know, all of these little things
that bring us hope can be really

882
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,800
useful. I don't know if there's
anything that you found that

883
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,710
you're like, yes, this is really
helpful, whether it's for you,

884
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,840
or someone you know, or for your
projects in terms of tech and

885
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,699
mental health, but I'd love to
hear about it.

886
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,630
Cameron Bardell: I don't have
anything, you know, anything

887
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,820
like deep learning or AI or
anything like that. I did take

888
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,650
some of my own trend data and
kind of feed it into a

889
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,989
prediction engine in a
classification engine, just to

890
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:32,399
see if I can find, you know,
anything. I didn't find anything

891
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:33,809
that's

892
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,789
useful, mostly because my data
is like, pretty one dimensional.

893
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,280
But yeah, I don't, nothing that
I've used personally comes right

894
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,260
to

895
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,780
mind. But like you said, you
know, we're kind of using our

896
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,300
own experiences to look at these
things. And you said, well,

897
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,309
maybe it'll take a long time for
these to come out and be

898
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,519
available to use ourselves but
or, we could use our experiences

899
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:52,589
to build them for, you know, the
next group of people. And they

900
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,659
can improve

901
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,699
upon what we build. I think
that's kind of the dream of the

902
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,679
tech industry is that things
keep improving. So, (laugh)

903
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,659
hopefully. We'll

904
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:01,260
see how it goes.

905
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,159
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, deep
learning stuff is cool. We

906
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,668
actually, like one component of
our app is like the whole

907
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,938
reminder of something, you know,
relevant to what you're going

908
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:18,809
through right now. And we're
building this with like, AWS

909
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:23,369
Amplify, which gives us access
to a couple cool like machine

910
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:28,048
learning stuff that they have
kind of built-in. And right now,

911
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,929
we're kind of like trying to
figure out the best way to kind

912
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:35,338
of compare one entry that you're
not having a good day on

913
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:40,259
to something that's like,
relevant, but you did have a

914
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:44,278
good day on to remind you of
stuff. So while we're kind of

915
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:48,869
like using that, I guess API for
now, what we kind of want to do

916
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,438
eventually is probably build
something of our own based on

917
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:57,509
like, what our users are
actually going through. So we

918
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:00,208
have someone on board who's kind
of like leading that a little

919
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:07,139
bit. And, yeah, I think there's
a lot of room to do some cool

920
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,148
stuff with deep learning and
mental health.

921
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,329
Dan Ott: That's pretty
interesting. I know, I keep

922
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:18,659
coming back to the cognitive
therapy stuff, but like yet,

923
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,650
like adding that little aspect
into it. And you're saying,

924
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:26,699
like, for example, you're like,
you're really upset, because you

925
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,460
feel like you can't do a thing
or something. And then the app

926
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,349
can be like, well, here.
Actually, here's proof that you

927
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:32,879
have done (laugh) a similar
thing, you know, like six times

928
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,409
in the

929
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,800
past, like, since we've started,
you know, working together, or

930
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,629
something like that, that could
be really, I don't know. Really

931
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,429
valuable.

932
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,300
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah,
definitely.

933
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Always, um,
you know, like, after I finally

934
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:54,570
felt like I was a, had my trauma
under control, I always

935
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,199
would talk to people about this
idea of like, having this

936
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,619
experience in your back pocket,
like, look, I was able to make

937
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,269
it through this. And it was
really challenging for a period

938
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:09,929
of time. But I've developed
these tools, or like, I know

939
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,719
that I need community, or I know
that this is going to be a

940
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,309
trigger for me to predict some
of those things. But at the

941
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:21,750
beginning of the pandemic, I
found myself, again, frustrated

942
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,670
with myself, because I thought,
you know, so much of what I feel

943
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,389
like I'm going through, like, I
lost my job, my kids were at

944
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,469
home, and I was supervising
their schooling. And I just felt

945
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:37,559
like really isolated and alone.
I'm like, I have navigated

946
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,860
through this before. But I'm
crying every single night. Like,

947
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,809
what, what, why, why can't I
make it through this and, and

948
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,789
like, ultimately, what I
remembered was, hey, community

949
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:49,769
plays

950
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,829
a really big role in that,
right? And so that's, that's how

951
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:55,710
Virtual Coffee was started.
Because I was like, hey, anyone

952
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,760
want to get together because I
feel really lonely. But then

953
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:05,670
also, recognizing that I wasn't
the only one going through the

954
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,789
experience of the pandemic, and
the effects of it. Like,

955
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:13,409
everybody was experiencing it.
And that's very different from

956
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:18,150
navigating your own situation.
And so, you know, I think, for

957
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,869
me, at least, I have this
tendency to be really frustrated

958
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,119
with myself when I think like, I
should have the skills or the

959
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,940
tools or whatever to make it
through this. But also, not

960
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,159
every experience is the same.
And that's gonna vary from time

961
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,480
to time. So there's learning new
things, and there's growing as a

962
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,769
person. And I think that, you
know, being able to share those

963
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:45,119
things, and the first couple
Virtual Coffees, that's what

964
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,469
they

965
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:49,409
were, it was like, I'm
frustrated, there's a pandemic,

966
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
and I'm very sad about it right
now. But that's what creates

967
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,619
that like closeness and that
ability for vulnerability and,

968
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:01,469
you know, for, for other people
to be able to share their

969
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:02,460
stories as well.

970
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,559
Dan Ott: Word. (laugh)

971
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:08,924
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: (laugh)
Sorry. I feel like I did a

972
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:09,899
monologue. You

973
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,619
can cut that.

974
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,050
Cameron Bardell: No, don't cut
that.

975
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,429
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, that was
awesome.

976
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:15,929
Dan Ott: No, I think it was
great. I just didn't have

977
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:16,889
anything really to add.

978
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:17,940
Rahat Chowdhury: And not to add.
Yeah. (laugh)

979
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:28,739
Dan Ott: Okay, so wrapping up. I
guess just the last question

980
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,599
that is a little more general.
We, in Virtual Coffee, talk a

981
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,840
lot about you know, finding
teams and you know, find a job

982
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,440
and stuff like that. So when
you're thinking about either

983
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,159
joining a company or creating a
team to work on a project, what

984
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,784
is, what is like a
characteristic, what just, just

985
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,409
like pick one,

986
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:53,460
but what is one characteristic
that you value in people, in

987
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,789
people you work with? We'll
start with Rahat.

988
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,750
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I mean,
I've been recently applying for

989
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,349
jobs and stuffs. So one thing
I've been kind of like, asking a

990
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,289
lot about is like, how the
culture is in terms of like pair

991
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:11,010
programming. I love like
learning things from like my

992
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,989
experience steps. So if there's
like a environment for that,

993
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:20,369
that's definitely something
super important to me. I've had

994
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,500
a couple of companies tell me
straight up that, yeah, we don't

995
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,924
really have time for that, like
hmm, probably don't want to

996
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:25,348
continue

997
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:32,099
with you then. So, yeah, I mean,
I feel like that kind of like,

998
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:36,179
shows you a little bit about
how, you know, senior devs kind

999
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:41,039
of like support the more junior
ones. And I guess the overall

1000
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,650
team dynamic of like, having
that willingness to just like

1001
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,530
hop on a call or something with
somebody and help them through a

1002
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,070
problem.

1003
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,844
Dan Ott: Yeah, absolutely. I
found with pair programming,

1004
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:54,268
too,

1005
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:57,960
it's, it's sometimes, it's a top
down issue, right? You know? So,

1006
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:02,460
so like, you could have a senior
developer, be willing, or you

1007
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,380
know, willing to talk and
willing to do stuff like that.

1008
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,659
But when you phrase it as like
pair programming, then

1009
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,114
management gets jumpy, because
two people, like in their mind,

1010
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:09,569
two people are

1011
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,530
working on the same problem or
whatever, so, yeah. I think

1012
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,360
that's, that's really important
to think about when you're

1013
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:18,179
finding people to work with.
Cameron, what about you?

1014
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,730
Cameron Bardell: Yeah, that was
a good one. One thing I noticed,

1015
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:23,190
I was doing a bunch of
interviewing. I interviewed at a

1016
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,380
lot of places, even something
like that, I was pretty sure I

1017
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,900
would take a job just to kind of
find out what the tech industry

1018
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,090
was like, because I didn't
really know. And one thing I

1019
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,699
noticed was, that kind of stood
out to me with some places don't

1020
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:34,559
ever talk about like, the
products they're building. And

1021
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,019
if you (laugh) can't really tell
if they care about what they're

1022
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:40,590
building, or if they want to be
good. And yeah, I just

1023
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,289
really wanted to build something
where like, everybody wanted to

1024
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,440
actually make it good. You know,
even if it was something that

1025
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,614
would have just be an internal
tool, or you know, something

1026
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:50,218
that's in

1027
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,409
kind of like a boring industry,
like, I still want to make

1028
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,869
something that's nice to use and
looks good, and supports

1029
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,380
accessibility and all these
things. See, I kind of, I was

1030
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,119
definitely more willing to talk
to people who seem to care and

1031
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,449
know a lot about the product and
want to continually improve it

1032
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,909
instead of just, I don't know,
make it good enough.

1033
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,050
Dan Ott: Yeah, I think that's, I
think that's great. I feel like

1034
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,469
that's usually a good sign that
like, people are invested in it,

1035
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,690
too. And don't have a lot of
turnover, you know, if you have

1036
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,249
a new, new people that are
coming and going all the time,

1037
00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:21,808
then you

1038
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,849
can't like build any connection
to it, right? So,

1039
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,174
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. It's
kinda surprising you. Especially

1040
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,448
a lot of the startups

1041
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:27,664
was working at, I thought they
were all like, deeply care

1042
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:28,879
about,

1043
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,219
like the thing that they're
building, but they didn't.

1044
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,899
Dan Ott: They deep, deeply?
Yeah. Maybe deeply care about

1045
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,038
the project, but,

1046
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:36,079
Cameron Bardell: Maybe they
deeply care about the money they

1047
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:36,709
were making? Yeah. (laugh)

1048
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,739
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Awesome.
Thanks for being here. We really

1049
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,739
enjoyed having this
conversation. But before we

00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,030
