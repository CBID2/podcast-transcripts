00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,498
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode eight of

2
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:10,292
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,086
that

4
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:16,775
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,050
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,325
their

7
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,265
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:23,720
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,175
it with

10
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,025
you here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,805
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we sat
down with Aurelie Verrot.

12
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,865
Aurelie

13
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,570
is a software engineer
originally from France, but who

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,275
now lives in

15
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:40,625
the San Francisco bay area. Like
many of us Aurelie has been

16
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,746
working from home since the
pandemic started. And she shared

17
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,066
with us, some of her
experiences, uh, going through

18
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,386
all that as

19
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,990
well as some important
approaches and habits, uh, that

20
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,594
allow us to

21
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:51,066
be healthy and productive.

22
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,250
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,039
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,199
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,359
Today's

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
question is if you could be one
kind of plant, what would it be?

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:19,563
We hope you enjoy this episode.
Hi, I'm Bekah. I am a front end

28
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:25,293
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could be any kind

29
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:32,554
of plant, I would be, I really
want to say like Sequoia because

30
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,039
they're really tall and cool,
but I've never seen one in real

31
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,524
life.

32
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:40,293
An aloe plant seems useful cause
they're healing, but like air

33
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:43,864
plants are really resilient and
they're tiny and you don't have

34
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,819
to do that much to take care of
it. And that, that also seems

35
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,118
good.

36
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,769
Dan: What was that? What kind of
plant is that

37
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,748
Bekah: An air plant.

38
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,019
Dan: Air plant?

39
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:51,938
Bekah: Yeah.

40
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,789
Dan: So like from a video game
or something,

41
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,578
Bekah: No, it's not from a video
game. It's like a real thing.

42
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,838
Dan: you know, aloe plants are
only healing. If you break off

43
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:04,858
the, you know, you have to
destroy the destroy, the plants,

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,199
get them, although that's a
whole different. Um, hi, I'm

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,239
Dan. I am

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,049
a front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio. Um, if I could

47
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,269
be any kind of plant, I think
like, uh, like a maple tree or

48
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,594
something would be cool. Um, I
was really trying to think of

49
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:24,919
all

50
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,643
the other kinds of plants that I
know, and I can only come up

51
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,367
with

52
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:30,438
like three or four off the top
of my head. Uh, wouldn't want to

53
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,508
be

54
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:34,327
like. Yeah, I think just going
to go with maple tree cause

55
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:36,146
they're

56
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,961
cool. And like, plus it's on a,
that's on a whole country's

57
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,776
flag,

58
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,866
you know, so that's cool too. So
that's going to be my

59
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:43,387
Bekah: So it'd

60
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:43,766
Dan: answer.

61
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:44,467
Bekah: like, oh,

62
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:45,236
Dan: That's right.

63
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,447
Bekah: the flag. It's not

64
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,366
Dan: Exactly.

65
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:48,067
Bekah: is me.

66
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:52,188
Aurelie: Hi, my name is I am
from the San Francisco bay area

67
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,633
and I

68
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,323
am a software engineer. And, um,
if I I think I would be some

69
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:02,013
kind

70
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,463
of lavender. I lived

71
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,408
Dan: That's a good one.

72
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:10,623
Aurelie: south of France for a
while, and I had like fields of

73
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:14,614
lavender everywhere. It's just
my favorite plant, I guess.

74
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,199
Dan: That's a good one. I like
that one.Lavender pretty and

75
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,799
like, and useful, you know,
that's, that's good. It's a good

76
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:23,158
combo.

77
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,593
Bekah: I have three lavender
plants in my front yard for the

78
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:35,739
first time. It did not die. So I
am very excited about it. Um, so

79
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,968
welcome. We are very,

80
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:37,364
Dan: Good.

81
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:42,098
Bekah: to have you here on the
podcast today. Um, and we always

82
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:46,748
like to start off the podcast
with your origin story. So how

83
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:51,188
did you get to where you are as
a software developer? Okay.

84
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:57,693
Aurelie: Yeah. So, um, I'm a
recent career changer. Um, so

85
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:00,143
before I was in quality safety
and then very much management,

86
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:02,563
in

87
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:06,233
France. I moved in the US in
2015 and I couldn't work. Uh,

88
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:09,903
because

89
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:16,144
of my visa. And so I took the
time to raise my kids and make

90
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:24,004
sure the family was fully
integrating new environment, um,

91
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,138
when I've been able to work. Um,
one thing I knew for sure that

92
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:30,212
it

93
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:37,444
was that I didn't want to pursue
my previous career. So I try

94
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:42,163
different things. And at some
point, uh, I tried some coding

95
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:48,004
tutorials. Um, why that mostly
because my husband is an

96
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:54,394
engineer. And so I go to an easy
go-to I guess. Uh, and I liked

97
00:04:54,394 --> 00:05:00,033
it, uh, but it was like kind of
hard for me to learn by myself.

98
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,689
So at some point I decided to
join a bootcamp. And they did

99
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:10,218
yeah, two month and a half,
three months bootcamp, and then,

100
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:14,718
um, a,

101
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:17,358
an internship for six months.
And then I found my first job

102
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,938
and I

103
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:20,639
started in May.

104
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,682
Bekah: That's awesome. That
seems like a really fast

105
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:25,692
journey. How

106
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,502
long did it take you? Um, from
the time you kind of started

107
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:36,692
Aurelie: I started mid 2019 with
my first. Yeah, my first

108
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:43,531
tutorials, like just learning
Ruby, running Java script. Um,

109
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:47,161
but I didn't really know what to
do with that. I mean, it was.

110
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:53,682
Kind of cool. I started to solve
some algorithm, but I couldn't

111
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:58,451
figure out how to use that, to
create like websites and

112
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:02,126
application and everything. So,
yeah. And I just tried to find

113
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:05,770
my

114
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:11,247
answers, you know, Google, like
everybody else. And there was so

115
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,916
many information. I couldn't
just grip breast any, so yeah,

116
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,585
I, at

117
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:23,786
some point just, I needed help
to, to learn, I guess, um, and

118
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:28,137
learning by myself. I know it's
not where I'm the strongest. So

119
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:33,266
yeah, I signed, I searched for
bootcamps that could allow me to

120
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:36,604
to take care of the kids and.
And also being able to travel to

121
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,252
San

122
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:46,872
Francisco. Um, uh, yeah, and I
found one and I applied and it

123
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,587
went really fast. Yeah, for
sure. Uh, in like two months it

124
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:52,302
took to

125
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:57,221
between the decision, finding
the bootcamp and passing all the

126
00:06:57,312 --> 00:07:02,951
interviews for the boot gym in
two months I was enrolled. So

127
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:03,221
yeah.

128
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,211
Bekah: What do you think? What
was the difference in learning

129
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:10,572
experience between learning on
your own and joining up?

130
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:18,526
Aurelie: Um, the problem I found
with learning on my own was

131
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:23,487
really this fire hose of
information. And about

132
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:27,206
everything. It's you search
something and you find something

133
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,616
for something for JavaScript,
and you find something for 5,000

134
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,026
for,

135
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,861
and you asked for some advice
and people will give you or an

136
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:39,206
answer

137
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:43,047
with what they know. And
sometimes it's not what you are

138
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:50,036
working on. And for me, it was
just too hard to find. Really

139
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,321
focused on something. Um, I was
absorbing opinions from

140
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:56,606
everybody

141
00:07:56,697 --> 00:08:02,877
and I just couldn't make my own
curriculum, you know, so having

142
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:05,771
something more structured and
also I think someone, um, I

143
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:08,665
could

144
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:16,586
ask all my questions. Um, it was
something I thought will help me

145
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,991
better. So, yeah, it was, it was
really, it was better for me.

146
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,706
And

147
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:27,867
also, so English is not my first
language. Um, when I started the

148
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:34,736
bootcamp, I was not super
confident with new talking

149
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:41,427
English. So I think someone will
take the time to talk with me to

150
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:47,246
understand where I don't
understand things and explain me

151
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:53,996
slowly. Um, some stuff, um, it
was really helpful. So yeah, I

152
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:58,677
really appreciated the bootcamp
for that. And I searched for

153
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:02,336
online, online bootcamp at
first. Um, but I realized that

154
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:05,936
to learn

155
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:08,442
English, it was maybe easier for
me to have the person in front

156
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,947
of

157
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:17,861
me and, you know, um, Reading
lips when people talk. So it

158
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,331
wasn't really easier for me to
have someone in front of me,

159
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:20,801
like

160
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:23,741
a real person. Yeah.

161
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:28,981
Bekah: Yeah. absolutely. And so
your bootcamp was it a hybrid

162
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,931
bootcamp? Some, some of it was
at home. Some of it was on

163
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,881
campus or

164
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:33,662
how was that structured?

165
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,182
Aurelie: So I chose an in-person
boot camp, so it was supposed to

166
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:43,922
be 12 weeks of in-person
bootcamp. And I started on

167
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:48,436
January 27th, 2020. So everybody
knows what happened in March.

168
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:52,590
So,

169
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,761
so I did six weeks of in-person
and six weeks of our remote

170
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:05,532
learning because of COVID
restrictions. it was really

171
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:10,841
challenging, uh, to be honest,
uh, I really liked the, the

172
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:14,921
in-person way also because it
made me, um, meet a lot of

173
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,851
people

174
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,841
that I wouldn't have met
otherwise, you know, when you're

175
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:26,781
a stay at home, mom, uh, you
meet moms and that's it. So

176
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:30,721
yeah, in

177
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:35,187
the bootcamp really. A lot of
different people and it was

178
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,157
really great to have like the
backgrounds, they all have

179
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,811
different background and it was
great. It was really, um,

180
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:42,986
helpful

181
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,806
for me to talk with these
people. Um, for me personally,

182
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:48,626
and also

183
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:56,532
for, um, of the tech and, uh,
switching to remote. Well, first

184
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:01,091
I had to, you know, you have to
adjust and also we didn't have

185
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:06,672
this. Um, the connection that we
had before discussions were

186
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:12,402
mostly on slack. People didn't
have time, even me to like, do

187
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:15,251
some zoom meeting after classes.
So it was really different.

188
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah.

189
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:21,462
Well, less than directions. Um,
but it went well. Uh, in the

190
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:24,642
end,

191
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:30,851
yeah, I really missed like, uh,
the social part it, which is

192
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:35,652
strange because I'm usually
someone who like, loves to live

193
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:43,062
in a cave and, uh, talk to
nobody. But I guess, I guess it

194
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:44,831
changed me. So yeah.

195
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,321
Dan: Yeah. I feel like a lot of
us learned some stuff about

196
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:51,441
ourselves when the, when the
pandemic started and all the

197
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,910
quarantine stuff happened, you
know?

198
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:53,910
Aurelie: Yeah.

199
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:54,995
Dan: You know, my, my natural
thing is like, oh, I hate

200
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:55,909
people.

201
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,600
I don't want to be anywhere.
know, the same thing live in a

202
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,025
cave, you know? And then all of
a sudden when you're forced to

203
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,450
not

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,745
ever see anybody, it's like, oh,
No, it turns out I actually do,

205
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:10,336
like, people might not like, you
know, lots and lots of people or

206
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:14,535
anything, but, uh, yeah. It's,
uh, I don't know. That was, that

207
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,576
was an experience. I'm sure it
actually had probably, uh, well,

208
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,916
I don't, I was going to say I'm
sure. I don't know if I'm sure,

209
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,755
but, um, fact that you started
your class kind of started all

210
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:26,015
together. Um, and you had six
weeks. Is that what you said

211
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:28,190
before? Uh, before, uh, you
know, the quarantine started? So

212
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,365
that

213
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,615
probably helped a little bit. I
mean, you at least knew the

214
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:36,515
teacher and you knew, um, the,
your classmates and stuff I

215
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,690
imagine was much harder. Um, you
know, starting from, from

216
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,865
scratch

217
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,186
in that, in that situation.

218
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:46,696
Aurelie: Yeah, for sure. I don't
think I would have, um,

219
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:52,966
succeeded. Um, yeah, maybe at
all. If it was online, heard

220
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,710
many. Um, people talk to me
about the same, uh, boot camp I

221
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,395
did,

222
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:02,100
but online, completely online.
And, um, I, I think you need

223
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,805
some

224
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:14,505
skills, like self skills and
everything, to really succeed

225
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:21,240
kind of online training. And
these skills, I don't have them,

226
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,791
I guess, or maybe not enough. I
don't know.

227
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,121
Dan: It's definitely
interesting. I don't know if I

228
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,201
would, I mean,

229
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,530
skills is an interesting word,
but there's everybody kind of

230
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,015
learns differently. Right. And
so, uh, it's, it's more. W what

231
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:42,275
were your sort of what you're
suited to? Right. And, and I

232
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:45,485
don't, I mean, I don't learn
from lectures really, or people

233
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,576
talking, you know, but of course
I have the same issue with video

234
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:55,926
Uh, I, I have problems. I dunno.
Um, I don't know what the right

235
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,741
word is, but, uh, I, I don't,
um, the information doesn't

236
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,556
stick in

237
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:02,076
my brain, right. until I do
things, but the self guided

238
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:04,596
stuff

239
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:07,355
only works for me personally.
Uh, when I am super into

240
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:10,114
whatever it

241
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,846
is, you know, I always.
Personally I'm self-taught, but

242
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,816
like I said, I'm self-taught, as
in like, I'd learned things but

243
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,571
bit at a time, you know, bits at
a time, as I things that

244
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,296
interest

245
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:23,296
me in college or whatever, like
w in my free time, uh, and the

246
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,296
idea

247
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:28,426
of trying to do that from
scratch now seems horrifying. So

248
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,556
I can

249
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:36,255
totally relate to like, wanting
to, um, the lesson planning and

250
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,936
stuff like that, that you can
kind of, kind of talked about.

251
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:42,600
And the, I would have no idea
what. To do or even, to tell

252
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,770
somebody what to do, you know,
if somebody is like, oh, I want

253
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,940
to

254
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:47,516
learn to be a developer. What
should I learn? You know, think

255
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:50,091
I

256
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,090
would, I'd be like, I have no
idea. know, learn stuff. It

257
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,080
seems

258
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,240
really hard to, to, to do all on
your own, like entirely on your

259
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,500
own. Um,

260
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,301
Aurelie: Yeah.

261
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:02,671
Dan: at least.

262
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,471
Aurelie: I'm the same, I think
also that need, like, it's not

263
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:14,931
that I need some guidance all
the way, but I think for, um, to

264
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:18,543
start, I need someone to guide
me when I start and I need to.

265
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,155
Maybe

266
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:27,466
show that I, I, I need to show
someone that I understood

267
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:35,505
something and to me the go to be
like maybe more confident and

268
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:42,375
then such sort by myself. But
yeah, I. I like to have like

269
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:47,775
person saying, okay, this, you
know, now you know how to do it.

270
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:53,416
You do it well. So go ahead and
do more that I need, I guess.

271
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,250
Bekah: Yeah. Even being in a
traditional classroom, you can,

272
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,405
when you see other students.
It's kind of acts as a gut

273
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,530
check,

274
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,755
right? Like if you're like, wow,
I'm really confused. Should I be

275
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,005
confused or other people like
you look around and you're like,

276
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,855
okay, that person definitely
looks confused too. So like, in

277
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,556
that sense, like there's a,
there's some community and that

278
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,576
kind of enables you to think
like, okay, well we're in this

279
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,946
together. We all need to figure
this out. So let's ask some

280
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,970
questions or, um, like, okay,
I'm not the only one that's

281
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,994
having

282
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:25,515
this experience right now. And
just like having that community

283
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:29,145
support, whether it's for a gut
check or to say like, yeah, this

284
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:33,010
is. It's tough, but you're doing
a good job. Just keep at it. But

285
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,341
sometimes that's all you need,
but when you're yourself and

286
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,331
there's so much information,
there's, it's oversaturated

287
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,321
amount of information, like you
said, some of it's good. Some of

288
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,696
it's not, some of it can apply
to what you're working on. Some

289
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,061
of

290
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,451
them, you don't recognize that
you can't apply it yet. Um,

291
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,890
because there are simple things
able to hear other people talk

292
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,105
about that, to ask questions and
to see, um, How, how people are

293
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,415
working through things can be,
um, a huge game changer for

294
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:04,725
that.

295
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,995
Aurelie: Yeah. And I had this
experience. We had some

296
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,960
exercise,

297
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,201
um, like we were trying to, I
don't know, create like a new

298
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,750
feature in class and there was
this kind of, um, algorithm to

299
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,875
solve for that. I know that by
myself, I wouldn't have been

300
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,000
able

301
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,480
to do it and other people, uh,
as well, but I had some, um,

302
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,240
understanding that helped them.
So there things as well, and

303
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:44,141
altogether, we were able to
deliver something that was

304
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:48,641
watching really well. So I think
this is important as well to

305
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:54,026
have. People around you and, um,
people you can talk to and

306
00:17:54,026 --> 00:18:01,375
exchange you spend way less time
to solve problem. And, um, and

307
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,915
these less frustrating in the
end. So yeah, I think the

308
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:11,006
learning experience is maybe
better by the way. I mean, but

309
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:13,066
like you said, then maybe for
some people, some people are

310
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,096
able

311
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:19,665
to learn as well by themself and
I admire that.

312
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,732
Bekah: I think it's good
practice though, to be able to

313
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,112
learn with

314
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:27,531
other people. Because when you
go out and start working, you're

315
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:28,971
probably going to be working
with team of people. And the

316
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:30,411
more

317
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:31,927
comfortable you are
communicating about things and

318
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,442
asking

319
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,466
questions, it's going to be
overall. I think for like being

320
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,490
a

321
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,551
part of a team, especially it's
a remote team,

322
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:48,771
Aurelie: Yeah. That's something
that I wasn't used to do my

323
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:52,116
previous career. It was more
like have one task to do and you

324
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:55,431
have

325
00:18:55,432 --> 00:19:02,221
to do it by yourself and the
Festus. And people were not

326
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:07,122
really, don't know, available to
help or things like that. You

327
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:11,926
didn't just. you didn't ask
actually. And so this is

328
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,761
something that I've learned,
with, with, coding. You have

329
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:17,596
ask,

330
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:22,096
have to ask for help. You have
to ask for people to test your

331
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,956
thing. You have a, yeah, you
have to ask for reviews, you

332
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,816
have to

333
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:34,606
ask to call So out to people and
say, Hey, uh, either someone to

334
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,224
review what I've done or. I
don't know what to do and I need

335
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,631
help

336
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:42,181
and something that I really
learned. Um, yeah. When I

337
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,520
started

338
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:50,818
coding, uh, it, something that
made me, a lot uncomfortable at

339
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:57,719
first, uh, to be honest, because
I like to be the person who is

340
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:03,028
expert on something. And I, I
like to be the one with the

341
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:08,773
answers. Instead of asking them,
but yeah, I changed now. I'm

342
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,213
asking questions all the time.

343
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:13,824
Bekah: I totally feel

344
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:13,973
Dan: Yeah.

345
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,563
Bekah: And, you know, as a
career changer too, and coming

346
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,123
from an

347
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:20,963
experience where I was the one
with all the answers having no

348
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:24,564
support from other people, it
definitely was a hurdle to get

349
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:27,834
through. And, you know, I taught
English for a lot of years and

350
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,263
would always be like, wow, I bet
you are a really good

351
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,935
communicator. Just a very
different role and I was not

352
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:35,607
used

353
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:39,298
to communicating in that way. So
no, I wasn't, I'm working on it

354
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,818
though, you know, um, it is
almost a new skillset to be able

355
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:48,238
to communicate in that way and
to ask those questions, um, I

356
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:51,658
want

357
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,048
to kind of the conversation a
little bit, because you talked

358
00:20:55,048 --> 00:21:00,808
about, you enjoyed being
in-person for bootcamp, and now

359
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:02,728
you're working a remote
position. And so like, I'd love

360
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,648
to hear

361
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:07,723
your take on that transition and
in why you chose remote work

362
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:10,798
over

363
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:14,429
being in person you liked the
in-person bootcamp. So.

364
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:22,513
Aurelie: Yeah. So I discovered
that it's not really. Um, being

365
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:27,703
in an office with people that I
like, it's more, more of the

366
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:34,483
interaction interactions with
people. Um, and I think working

367
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,768
remote remotely is not a
barrier. I mean, a blocker for,

368
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:41,053
um, team

369
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,618
communication and having fun
with your team and yeah. And

370
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,182
having,

371
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:50,290
yeah, great exchange and. Um,
and also I'm a mom, kids, and I

372
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,337
need

373
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:56,708
to be available and working
remotely is the easiest for me

374
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,078
to

375
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:06,548
be able to continue to try them
to the doctor or to whatever

376
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:13,058
activities they have. Um, I like
to be here. When thing, when do

377
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,153
you come back from school? And
if they have one more. I don't

378
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,248
want

379
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:22,378
to just run all the time. It's
something that I did when I was

380
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:26,519
in friends. I was working full
time from eight to six, uh,

381
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,858
picked up the kids at the
nanny's house at six, and then

382
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:31,168
you just

383
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,628
had to run to run, to run. And
it's honestly, it's just not the

384
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:44,328
life. Um, and yeah, since I had
the opportunity to change my

385
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:50,384
career, Why not changing the way
I was working. And, um, so yeah,

386
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:55,168
uh, something that I decided
like early. Um, I, I, I wanted

387
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:59,772
to work

388
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:04,814
from home. Uh, that was the
easiest for me. So, yeah. And

389
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:11,773
what I experienced today in my
team, um, I mean, we have great

390
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:18,763
way to interact. Um, with each
other, we have one-on-ones we

391
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:22,033
have coffee breaks. have, um,
what we have team lunch, uh,

392
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,303
like

393
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:31,003
every Thursday we, we, we eat
together and, yeah, it's great.

394
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:34,093
And we have a lot of varying,
um, session if we want to. And

395
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:37,183
yeah,

396
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:44,294
so it's really not about just
being the office. It's just. How

397
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:47,624
you want to create relationship
with your teammates, you know,

398
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:54,314
and yeah. So far it's been three
months now that I'm full-time

399
00:23:54,314 --> 00:24:00,703
remote and, uh, yeah, I think
I've made the choice. I really

400
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:01,094
like it.

401
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:05,483
Dan: Is everybody on your team?
Uh, full-time remote.

402
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:10,463
Aurelie: Yes. We are all four
remotes. Uh, we are all

403
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:19,483
mostly...We are all in the U S.
Um, so I'm in, I mean, the team

404
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:26,054
that is separated do teams. My
team is only in the us and the

405
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:34,273
other little team is, uh, Um, so
yeah, and it, for example, it's

406
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:39,884
another challenge. Uh, we had
like a summit for, um, our team

407
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:42,328
that is called an organization.
And, uh, we had to have

408
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,772
everybody

409
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:49,903
on zoom at the same time. And so
we had people during the day, we

410
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:53,360
had people during the night.
But, um, yeah, it's I, and I

411
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,817
think

412
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:59,383
people are willing to do that
because everything, everything

413
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,948
is

414
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:06,719
great and we have great
relationship between us. So,

415
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:09,598
yeah, it's, uh, it's great.
Maybe next time it will be us in

416
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:11,668
us

417
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,858
that will have to be up at
night. We'll see.

418
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,013
Bekah: Okay. I think that's such
a great point that you made

419
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:20,968
about

420
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,159
it's it's about the
relationships, right? It's not

421
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,959
necessarily about the place,
right? You are because there can

422
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,219
be various successful remote
teams, fully remote teams, and

423
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:34,638
there can be very successful in
person teams and, and there can

424
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:38,324
be, you know, Ones that are not
successful at all. And it just

425
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:40,513
depends on, you know, how are
you building your team? What,

426
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:42,702
how are

427
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:46,993
you creating the relationships
or the other people and like

428
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,708
recognizing them as, a person
and not just somebody that's got

429
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,393
to

430
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:56,203
get this work done. Um, and so I
think that's so important when

431
00:25:56,203 --> 00:26:01,898
people say, well, you can't have
the same relationship. On remote

432
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:04,403
teams that you can in person.
And for me, I found way more

433
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:06,908
value in

434
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:11,888
the remote teams that I've been
on I ever have my in-person

435
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,949
teams. And I think it's just
really about, you know, what,

436
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,108
what is the value of that team?

437
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:21,798
Aurelie: Yeah. I never believed
in the, you know, these

438
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,137
companies

439
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:30,808
will have like foosball and ping
pong tables and stuff like that

440
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:33,883
to create a environment. It's
not about that. You can have

441
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,958
like as

442
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:41,249
many foosball table you want and
your people won't talk to each

443
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:46,384
other. So it's not something I
really believe in. And, um, I

444
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:52,413
mean, if the leadership like is
willing to show that they are,

445
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:57,844
uh, okay with being remote, that
there are, um, the way that

446
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:00,831
they're communicating with each
other is. Remotely. And

447
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:03,818
sometimes

448
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:09,878
they organize fun things. Every
people, uh, in the Yarki will do

449
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,858
it because we do just what the
leadership does. That's that's

450
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:18,128
the way people work. So, yeah.
And if your company is

451
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:21,398
organizing

452
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,203
great events, just to have
people talking to each other and

453
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:27,008
meet,

454
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,221
um, whatever the. Department
they are working on and

455
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,253
everything. I

456
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:33,323
think this is how you create
work relationship with anybody

457
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:35,393
in the

458
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:40,374
company. And for example, my
company, um, last week or two

459
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:44,513
weeks ago, I don't remember. Um,
they're organized like every

460
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:48,443
trimester, uh, what they call
table four six. So you have to

461
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:53,064
register in advance. They have
like a list of people and people

462
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:56,874
that are randomly chosen. They
create a table. So it's a zoom

463
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:02,979
room. And they give you like a
budget to, uh, order something

464
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,393
with door dash and you are
eating your lunch with people

465
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,807
you

466
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:12,939
wouldn't have worked with maybe.
So. Yeah, it's a, I think that's

467
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:18,489
the kind of evidence that needs
to happen if you want your, your

468
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,338
employees to just have great
relationship relationship with

469
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:22,398
it.

470
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:25,537
Dan: I think that's really cool.
I was going to ask, you had

471
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,667
mentioned that you got your,
your S your small team does like

472
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,797
every

473
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:32,166
week, right? I mean, it's kind
of eat together kind of thing.

474
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:32,767
Aurelie: Yeah.

475
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:36,696
Dan: think that's. Is there any
other, um, sort of, not like the

476
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:40,866
big summit level stuff, but, uh,
any sort of week-to-week stuff

477
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,506
that, um, that your team does
or, the organization does to

478
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:46,146
improve,

479
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,436
you know, your communications in
near relationships, um, on your

480
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:50,676
team.

481
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:57,192
Aurelie: Yeah. So, um, well, in
my team, we have like a wall to

482
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,954
have like least one SU meeting
altogether. So when we don't

483
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:04,716
have

484
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:07,896
any new organized, like a coffee
break or something like that,

485
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,921
it's short, but it's just, Hey,
what did you do this weekend?

486
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,706
And

487
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:15,307
blah, blah, blah. So this is
something that we do. We also

488
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:18,652
have, we also use the new
feature from slack, the slack

489
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:21,997
huddle. So

490
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:28,356
we use that mostly to talk with
all the We have, like Melbourne

491
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:32,166
or Singapore. Then, um, what
else do they do? So, yeah,

492
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:35,946
there's the

493
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:39,276
table four, six. There's a, the
end cred. Oh, okay. So

494
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,606
onboarding

495
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:45,756
process. Um, we are, um, in
teams during the onboarding

496
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:48,876
process.

497
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:52,942
And so we have like some
activities. I'll just call that

498
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,461
company and everything and they
encourage us to just stay in

499
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,031
contact. So like every month,
month and a half, I have this

500
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:06,602
meeting with my team that I
onboard with. And, um, so it's,

501
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:10,471
you know, it's tiny things like
that. They also organize like,

502
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:17,551
um, My company works a lot with
charities. They encourage

503
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:22,592
volunteering they encourage
people to rope together to do

504
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:27,142
some volunteering as well. So
it's all the things that they

505
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:30,361
are. I think they are trying to,
uh, find, um, ways for people

506
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,570
to,

507
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:37,752
um, to show their common
interest and build on that. I

508
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:41,392
think it's

509
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:46,852
yeah, it's a great idea. They
have a, yeah. And we have also,

510
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:53,092
um, like societies they call
them, that, so for example, we

511
00:30:53,092 --> 00:31:00,112
have like, uh, Um, society for
women, for women in engineering,

512
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:04,074
for parents, for people from
the, uh, LGBTQA, uh, community,

513
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:07,976
it's,

514
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:11,053
uh, it it's great. And, um, To
try to yeah. To build on that

515
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:14,130
and

516
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:17,080
think this is how you make
people talk to each other. Yes.

517
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,019
Yeah.

518
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,590
Dan: I think that's really cool.
My, uh, yeah, my wife works for

519
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,050
Teach for America and they do,
they have a lot of stuff in it.

520
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:32,585
Similar, similar kinds of
things, you know, um, that they

521
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,069
do to

522
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,861
sort of promote, um,
interpersonal relationships, you

523
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,671
know, on their teams. Uh,
sometimes I think they might go

524
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:45,020
overboard. You know, they spend,
you know, a lot of time on zoom,

525
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,260
um, altogether, but it's, it's
cool. And, and I mean, and she

526
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,490
loves her team too, you know,
and they, they, they're all,

527
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,720
they're

528
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:51,801
all spread all over the place
and all remote and everything

529
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:52,881
too.

530
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,951
It's very cool. And I, I feel
like it is it's, uh, important

531
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:58,211
to

532
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,171
that's one of the things that
some parts of it happened

533
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,260
automatic or can happen
automatically when you're all in

534
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,911
the same you know? Uh, and
obviously there's plenty of

535
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:15,431
unhealthy in the world, but like
it's, I feel like it takes more

536
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:17,703
concerted effort. Um, When
you're, um, you know, on a

537
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,975
remote

538
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:23,665
team, um, to do that sort of
thing, because it's easy to into

539
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:28,405
cave, cave person mode. Right.
Um, and think the thing you said

540
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,965
at the beginning when I asked
this question was about how a

541
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,404
lot

542
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:36,885
of it comes from leadership. Um,
uh, I just want to just touch on

543
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,046
that again, because I feel like
that's, that's really true and

544
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:42,165
it's important, you know, if, if
leadership is like, make some

545
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,680
sort of rule that everybody has
to do something, but doesn't,

546
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,195
you

547
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:47,025
know, don't participate in it or
anything. Um, I feel like lots

548
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,855
of

549
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:54,016
times that ends up just causing
resentment at best and doesn't

550
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,516
actually promote, you know, uh,
any, any So I think that's

551
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,016
really

552
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,796
cool that the is sort of part of
this whole process. Yeah.

553
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:05,235
Aurelie: Yeah. And also we are,
um, So we have offices the

554
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:08,595
world.

555
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:11,686
We have employees all over the
world and some rules are in

556
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:14,776
place

557
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:17,760
as well to, um, to make sure
that people who are not on us

558
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,684
time

559
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:26,266
zones also feel part of the
company, you know? And, um, I

560
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:30,615
think that's, that's, great. We
have like all important meetings

561
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:33,905
have to be recorded. That way,
if someone is on another time

562
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:36,655
zone

563
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:39,490
and can join, or even if someone
has an emergency at home and

564
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,295
they

565
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:46,195
have to pick up their kids, they
can still have all the

566
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:50,635
information that has been shared
during the meeting. And I think

567
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:57,536
it's a game changer when people
do that. Remote work is really

568
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:06,155
possible. Otherwise, I, I don't
know. Yeah. If your job is only

569
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:09,125
for us market, maybe it's
easier, but as long, I mean, if

570
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,035
it's from

571
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:15,576
somewhere else or you have
people working from elsewhere,

572
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:18,576
you have

573
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:20,345
to implement these things in
your house, you have to force

574
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:22,114
it.

575
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:26,885
Otherwise, like you said, the
first thing people do usually is

576
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,876
just to KV.

577
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:32,396
Bekah: And it's nice too. When
you, when you have communities

578
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,061
of

579
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:39,581
belonging, where you have shared
interests, easier to learn more

580
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:43,181
about so many there. And then
also to like branch out beyond

581
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,440
that, because when you have an
environment that, know, feels.

582
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,530
One, like you're comfortable
there, there are these people

583
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,041
around you that you trust and,
you know, and they'll have

584
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,766
different overlapping
communities then you would have

585
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:57,431
to. And so

586
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,400
then there just becomes this,
like, know, you have these sub

587
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,900
communities, but then it all
works together to feel to create

588
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,641
something that's like this, this
nice big. Supportive community

589
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:14,471
that allows you to do, So much
more because when, when you feel

590
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:17,260
safe in a space, when you know
that you can trust those people,

591
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,030
then you're more likely to grow
and to take chances or risks or

592
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:28,606
be innovative, um, and and move
faster. It's funny. Yeah. That

593
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,956
it's not more highly valued on
teams like, oh, well, that's,

594
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:36,226
that's not, um, it's not a
valuable thing that doesn't help

595
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:41,925
us with our product, but, but it
does because of the side effects

596
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:50,885
of having a supportive place.
Um, so I know that there are

597
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,400
certainly lots of people out
there that. Are not interested

598
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,915
in

599
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,270
remote work, um, narrow
struggles that are associated

600
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,595
with it as

601
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:02,441
well. I know for me, you know,
I, I work remotely and I don't

602
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:04,286
have

603
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,346
an office space. So sometimes
it's like really hard for me to

604
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:10,105
stop. I'm well, the computer's
there and the kids are playing

605
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:12,864
on

606
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,400
the sit down and do this one
more thing. w have you found to

607
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,935
be

608
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:21,356
useful to kind of some of those
struggles?

609
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:29,646
Aurelie: So I have to get, we
live in a two bedroom apartment,

610
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:34,805
um, and my kids have been, uh,
at remote school, um, all year,

611
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:38,975
last

612
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:48,056
year. Uh, so. Yes, there are
struggles when you want to, to

613
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:54,510
work from home, especially
today. Um, so it's it. I mean,

614
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,964
you can

615
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:02,900
do just what you can do with
what you have and the time that

616
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,835
you

617
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:09,456
have. So instead of stressing
about having like a super

618
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:17,005
private. Room for yourself with
closed doors and just try to

619
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:20,350
make, I mean, try to use what
you have and just work on that.

620
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,695
I

621
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:30,865
changed my, uh, desk space like
four times last year. And I

622
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,655
finally find my corner, you
know, it's not, I mean, I'm, I

623
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:36,445
mean the

624
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:40,053
living room, so, um, Yeah, with
the kids. It wasn't easy. At

625
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:43,661
some

626
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,490
point we were four people in
your apartment having zoom

627
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,319
meetings at

628
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,170
the same time. Um, you adjusts.
I mean, especially, I think it's

629
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:59,800
even easier now before. I don't
think people were really, um,

630
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,425
inclined to understand that
maybe you have a dog, maybe you

631
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,780
have a

632
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,578
kid, maybe you haven't even
baby, uh, or even. And there are

633
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:10,376
only

634
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:13,470
people that you have to take
care of. Um, now the understand

635
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,555
better

636
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:21,295
what it is because people were
forced to work from home. And I

637
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:26,996
think this is when, if, if you
really want to work from from

638
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:31,286
home. Um, this is when you can
find your thing without really

639
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:33,881
stressing out about it. So at
first, like for example, I was

640
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,476
in

641
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:38,493
the middle of the living room
and I had to get. Passing behind

642
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:40,510
me

643
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:48,340
all the time. Uh, well, I can do
anything. I can, I mean, take my

644
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,990
kids against the wall, just for
them to not walk behind me, you

645
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,681
know? So yeah, just try, just to
do with what you have. Zoom can

646
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:04,780
allow you to put backgrounds,
just use that and your kids.

647
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:12,065
Well, My experience, my kids. So
they are 12 and 10. So obviously

648
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:16,476
it's easier than with little
kids. I don't really have the

649
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:23,405
experience with little kids, but
at least with my kids, uh, just

650
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:28,896
told them that what I was doing
was important and what I was

651
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:32,438
doing will maybe make us have
one day. I think it house like

652
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:35,980
with

653
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,391
maybe I will have my office and
they will have their own bedroom

654
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,390
and they won't have to run
behind me all the time. And, but

655
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,150
if

656
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:53,365
nobody is making any effort now,
Maybe what happened. So this is

657
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:57,326
what I try to explain them. And
they Enough to understand that.

658
00:39:57,385 --> 00:40:02,096
And so we try to establish rules
and every week we weren't

659
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:06,596
changing the world because we
tried something and it was not

660
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:13,561
adapted. And so we had to change
and, uh, but yeah, it's just. At

661
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:17,940
first, I was like super stressed
and I didn't want anybody to be

662
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,311
on camera and everything. it was
just impossible and it made me

663
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,240
really nervous. And like, for
example, during the bootcamp, my

664
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,900
son really wanted to uh, who was
my instructor. And so it was on

665
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,610
the, like on the couch with me.
And it was like, Just his head.

666
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,150
So at first it was just the hair
and then the nose and then the

667
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,990
full face. And you, you can't
avoid that. Um, but yeah, so I,

668
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,830
I

669
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,010
w R reviewed the rules like
multiple times. I tried to

670
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:05,951
organize their schedule mine to
make sure that at least. Um, I

671
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:07,720
had one moment in the morning
and one moment in the afternoon

672
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,489
with

673
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:15,521
a quiet time where I could set
up like some zoom meetings and I

674
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:22,090
mean the most important ones,
um, a good pair of headphones. I

675
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:30,731
mean, a lot of tools exist, um,
just to, to do that better, but

676
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,662
yeah. I mean, unless you are
already working in a company

677
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:36,564
that

678
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:41,606
will give you a steep end to buy
a set of new monitors and

679
00:41:41,606 --> 00:41:43,900
everything. Well, fine. Just do
that. But if you can't, you

680
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,194
just,

681
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:55,436
and also one thing that was, um,
important decide of the material

682
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,900
aspect and organize it or the
musician or more like aspect?

683
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,154
Um,

684
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:07,976
communication when I was in
projects during the bootcamps

685
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:10,421
and, uh, they wanted to, uh,
code all weekend for eight hours

686
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:12,806
a

687
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:19,106
day. Sorry, I can't, I can't,
give you three hours in the

688
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:21,041
morning and I can give you three
hours in the afternoon that's

689
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,976
it.

690
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:26,170
Because after that I need to
cook, I maybe I need to take

691
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,375
care

692
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:32,945
of my kids. Maybe I need you to
tell me also, you know, Mean,

693
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:39,255
yeah. So just being clear with
people, Maybe some people will

694
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:43,155
have some expectations from you
and you just have to be really,

695
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:52,096
um, um, I mean, just tell the
truth and say that things maybe

696
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:55,050
won't happen like that. And as
soon as you, mean, the sooner

697
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,004
you

698
00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:03,706
that the less struggles and
blockers and frustration it

699
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:11,201
creates, so. My only, yeah, I
think my only advice is just let

700
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:11,621
it go.

701
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:16,496
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's such
good advice, you know, and I

702
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,450
don't know if this is a mom
thing or not, but I know at

703
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,384
least a lot

704
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:24,365
of moms that I know now we, we
do a lot because we have to do a

705
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:28,235
lot. Right. And so. then we, we
want to continue to do things

706
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:30,185
that we enjoy doing or that
we've done before really well.

707
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:32,135
it's

708
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:33,860
really hard. Sometimes it just
doesn't happen. Or sometimes

709
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,585
like

710
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,135
we're in a different stage of
life and we need to let those

711
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:41,561
things go and it can be really
hard. To do that because you're

712
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,981
like, well, I enjoyed this or I
could be good at this, or I will

713
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:49,150
have enough time, I think you're
right. Saying like have clear

714
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,250
communication about things and
be okay with communicating that.

715
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,350
So,

716
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:57,615
I mean, and that's another thing
that goes. Creating trust. You

717
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:01,456
know, if you are, if you don't
just keep pushing through, just

718
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:06,436
be open to begin with and like,
I can do a little bit, but no, I

719
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,115
can not do that. And so.
there's, like the clear

720
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,794
communication

721
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:11,230
there's boundaries, your
setting, but then also talking

722
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,515
about being

723
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,815
flexible with things because you
can try it things it doesn't

724
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:19,505
work. And just having that
self-awareness I think a great.

725
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,571
too, to be able to work with
different groups of people and

726
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,581
to

727
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,201
with your team and, and make
sure that, everybody knows where

728
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:33,400
you're at, because that's what,
you know, that's, that's what,

729
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,170
creates good team.

730
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:42,360
Aurelie: Yeah, I think so. I
think so. Um, my resentfully, so

731
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:49,036
my kids find any return to
school. Uh, and so I have to

732
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,695
drive one, uh, in the morning
because it was cool. It was

733
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:58,396
really far away. And also, I
think he's too little to go by

734
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:04,335
himself. Um, so I ha I I've just
told my kid and my kids, my CMS,

735
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:11,536
um, yeah, starting um, August
11th, I won't be able to accept

736
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:16,666
any zoom meeting at eight. It
will be eight 30. That's it, I

737
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:22,365
mean, and nobody said, oh my
gosh, Nope. Everybody say, oh

738
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:25,065
yeah, of course. That's it's.
Yeah. So I think sometimes we

739
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:27,765
are

740
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,092
most stressed about saying the
thing more than really. Yeah.

741
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:34,058
too

742
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,489
much, I guess.

743
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:39,554
Bekah: That's for sure. Well, I
think, you know, all of these

744
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:41,953
things that you've talked about
it, think one of the benefits

745
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:44,352
of.

746
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:48,974
COVID and the pandemic and stuff
is, is that people are more open

747
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:50,998
and willing to this. And I mean,
moms have been impacted, I

748
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,022
think,

749
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:54,523
more than any other group or
they're very high up on the

750
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:55,873
list,

751
00:45:56,264 --> 00:46:01,423
but you know, I also think that
it's good that eventually, I

752
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,914
think there'll be more
opportunities for moms because

753
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:09,059
things like this are regular.
Like it's okay to have. On your

754
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,048
screen. okay to say I have to
take my kids somewhere. And in

755
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:16,349
some sense, it's normalize this
and hopefully that's something

756
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:21,478
that we forward because remote
work is that that's what makes

757
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,713
things doable for me as well, to
be able to take kids the

758
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,948
doctor's

759
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,628
or to a field trip or, you know,
whatever is, something that I,

760
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:33,958
that I want to be doing. And I'm
glad that I have that ability to

761
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,940
do that and to, you know, be
able to. Take that time and, and

762
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,922
not

763
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:46,963
have to in my car for a really
long commute somewhere. I knew a

764
00:46:46,963 --> 00:46:49,093
mom that was looking for work,
um, pre COVID and she was

765
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:51,223
looking

766
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:54,074
for her first job. And she said,
well, the only one that I was

767
00:46:54,074 --> 00:47:00,224
offered is a two hour commute,
two hours each way gets it's not

768
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:02,744
worth it. It is not worth that

769
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:03,528
Aurelie: No.

770
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:06,539
Bekah: is not that great. And I
don't, I don't know. I feel like

771
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,339
it's ridiculous for anyone to
ask somebody to commute that

772
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,139
like,

773
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:11,953
that's a, that's a red flag in
my mouth. Like yeah. Spend all

774
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:13,767
that

775
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:14,728
time in your car

776
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,289
Aurelie: Well, it's a,

777
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:17,128
Bekah: could work from home.

778
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,298
Aurelie: yeah, it's something
that we know a lot here in the,

779
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:24,958
in the barrier, because you have
a lot of people, you know,

780
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,253
working for like the giants,
like Google and apple Facebook.

781
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:29,548
And,

782
00:47:30,509 --> 00:47:35,159
but they can. I mean, they are
old enough to have kids and so

783
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:40,438
they can have a roommate. So
they have to live far away where

784
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:43,603
prices are I guess, to live. So
I know many people doing like

785
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:46,708
two

786
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,913
hours come here, morning and
afternoon. And it's, I think

787
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,118
it's

788
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,923
just crazy. And I'm glad for
them that we are in remote days

789
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:56,727
and

790
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:59,789
now they are just working from
home and everything is fine.

791
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:03,314
Dan: had, you know, when you're
talking about sort of breaking

792
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:04,889
up

793
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,429
your. Hours of your day or
whatever. I kind of touched on

794
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,568
it, but I was one I wanted, I
was wondering if you could talk

795
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:11,707
a

796
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,703
little bit about how you between
work and also taking care of,

797
00:48:13,703 --> 00:48:15,698
you

798
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,738
know, your family and
everything. Um, if you ha how

799
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:19,777
you kind of,

800
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:22,014
um, build any habits or anything
for self care and, you know,

801
00:48:22,014 --> 00:48:24,219
like

802
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:27,998
staying healthy and stuff like
that. Uh, if you, if you, if you

803
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:29,333
have anything, you know, any
tips or anything like that, I

804
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,668
could

805
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:31,239
probably use some.

806
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,554
Aurelie: I don't know if I have
good tips for that. But so

807
00:48:35,554 --> 00:48:39,454
actually it was really funny
because when I was a stay at

808
00:48:39,454 --> 00:48:45,818
home, mom, I never found time to
do anything like at all. And

809
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:49,628
since I work, I trained almost
seven hours a week. I don't

810
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:53,438
know.

811
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,974
Um, yeah, I don't know. It's
just a F yeah, no, I don't have

812
00:48:57,974 --> 00:49:01,789
any

813
00:49:01,878 --> 00:49:08,478
tips. It's just, uh, if I want,
I know that like hour I need to,

814
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:12,065
um, to go out of my desk and
just take few steps. Just

815
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:15,562
because, you

816
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:18,684
know, it's good for your eyes.
It's for your brain is good for

817
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:25,074
whatever. And so it's like, oh,
I need to the, I dunno, the

818
00:49:25,074 --> 00:49:29,364
dishwashers. I will do that. And
in the meantime, I will do some

819
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:34,313
stuff and come back to my desk.
And so it's something that I

820
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:38,273
tried to do, like every hour,
um, training, uh, do I train so

821
00:49:38,273 --> 00:49:42,233
much?

822
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:48,708
Um, probably because. Hey for
someone, some coaching. So it's,

823
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,619
it's a good motivator.

824
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:54,244
Dan: Are they scheduled? I mean,
is it, so if you're paying

825
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,224
somebody, so is it like it's on
the calendar

826
00:49:57,278 --> 00:49:58,929
Aurelie: uh,

827
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:02,503
Dan: yeah.

828
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:06,203
Aurelie: watch, uh, they won't
check when I do they can check

829
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,187
if

830
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,469
I've done all my trainings,
every.

831
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:12,753
Dan: Okay.

832
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,838
Aurelie: and then it's just to
me. Um, so I try to like early

833
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:20,392
in

834
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:23,844
the morning to do my training
before working. It just doesn't

835
00:50:23,844 --> 00:50:26,844
work, especially since the kids
are returning to school is just

836
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,953
it's too much. So I do that.
know that, uh, uh, when the kids

837
00:50:30,953 --> 00:50:34,403
are

838
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:43,614
eating because we make our kids.
It's um, together. And then I,

839
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:48,293
with my husband, we eat later,
like that's weekend have a sense

840
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:56,574
of, uh, you know, of, uh, um, no
date night, just night time for

841
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:57,264
adults, you know?

842
00:50:57,684 --> 00:50:58,643
Dan: Adult conversations.

843
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,284
Aurelie: Yeah, I don't
conversation. That's right. Uh,

844
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:06,054
so yeah, I, when they are eating
I train and so yeah, when they

845
00:51:06,054 --> 00:51:14,034
are eating their rice, I'm
squatting. No, I don't. I mean,

846
00:51:14,034 --> 00:51:19,251
yeah. I, I don't, I don't have
really any advice. I don't know

847
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,396
if you think you can do it in
the morning, just, just what's

848
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:23,541
your,

849
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:28,702
I don't know, your alarm clock
earlier or do it just no

850
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,486
pressure. And sometimes I don't
do it. And the next day I will

851
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:32,241
do

852
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,811
two trainings. That's why, I
mean,

853
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,771
Dan: I liked your, I liked your
approach with the concern of

854
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:41,411
getting up through that
throughout the day as well. Um,

855
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:45,226
and that like throwing in the
light. grabbing a couple of

856
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:48,646
chores, you know, or whatever in
the meantime, or, or doing that

857
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:50,835
sort of thing. I think that's
cool. I think that's a cool

858
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:51,315
approach.

859
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:54,596
Aurelie: It's really something
that I love with remote working

860
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:57,646
is being able to sprinkle the
chores. During the day like

861
00:51:57,646 --> 00:52:00,546
that,

862
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:03,471
it's not just a block up. I need
to clean today. No, you, you

863
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:06,305
that

864
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:06,612
Dan: Yeah.

865
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:07,117
Aurelie: you know,

866
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:07,416
Bekah: Yeah.

867
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,197
Aurelie: when you think about it
and it's, it's great like that.

868
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:16,717
So sometimes I'm like, have
laundry to fold and I have my

869
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,766
tests running on the, on the
monitor. so while the tests are

870
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,106
running, I'm folding some
t-shirts.

871
00:52:25,657 --> 00:52:25,896
Bekah: I think

872
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:26,092
Aurelie: That's

873
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:27,262
Dan: That's a really good idea.

874
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:28,027
Bekah: Twitter.

875
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,291
Aurelie: I, I just tried to be
chill and the more chill I am

876
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:35,061
and

877
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:40,581
the most I do. So I guess, eh,
maybe it's my advice. Just be

878
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:41,512
chill.

879
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:50,121
Bekah: Well, I think in the moms
in tech, um, Meet up that you a

880
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:53,181
couple of weeks ago, you were
talking about self-care and I

881
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:54,261
think this goes back to what you
were talking about earlier

882
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:55,341
today,

883
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,282
because a big part of that was
clear communication, too. Right.

884
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:04,507
being able to express your needs
and. And to be able to take time

885
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:08,766
for yourself or do things. And I
think that step is always just

886
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,847
recognizing like, okay, what is
going on with me right now?

887
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,726
Because I think, I don't know,
we just move so quickly that we

888
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:18,366
don't ever think that. I'll be
like laying in bed and then

889
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:20,796
like,

890
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,757
suddenly I'm like, oh, I
understood. I sat at my desk for

891
00:53:24,757 --> 00:53:28,657
a really long time. And I felt
really grumpy. But if I had

892
00:53:28,657 --> 00:53:34,657
gotten up and a walk, I probably
of chilled out and not this way

893
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:34,927
right now.

894
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:42,081
Dan: Yeah. And the, the. I think
it actually ties really well in

895
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,442
with the, um, having like the
happy teams and actually being

896
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:49,342
much more productive. You know,
you, you just, you said when

897
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:52,072
you're feeling chill, you
actually do more work. Right.

898
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:56,811
And. It can seem
counterintuitive, you know, like

899
00:53:56,811 --> 00:54:00,081
if you think, oh, you know, if,
if I force myself to sit at my

900
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:04,702
desk, you know, and, and, and
bang on whatever I'm working on

901
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:07,222
for hours and hours and hours,
you know, it seems like that's

902
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:09,742
the only way to get things done.
It's done sometimes, you know,

903
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:11,961
but the having healthy, you
know, healthy self and healthy

904
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:14,151
teams,

905
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:17,032
uh, you might be spending time
doing things that aren't like.

906
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:22,262
Writing code or whatever, but it
turns out makes all of you, you

907
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:24,107
know, yourself and then your
team much more productive,

908
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:25,952
ultimately,

909
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:29,911
which the, like, I think studies
have shown us to be obviously

910
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:34,411
very true too, but it's, uh, it
can be hard to, um, or it can be

911
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:36,781
easy to lose sight of, of that.
I think when you're in the, I

912
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:39,151
don't

913
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:40,441
know, in the thick of it, you
know, so I think that's really,

914
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:41,730
I

915
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:45,061
think, uh, keeping a chill is
it's very good advice.

916
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:45,476
Aurelie: Yeah.

917
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:48,717
Bekah: Well, Aurelie it's been
great to have you here with us.

918
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:49,931
Um, we really appreciate you
talking about this, cause this

919
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:51,056
is

920
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:54,927
something, um, everybody is
dealing with now, uh, before we

921
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:58,797
wrap up, is one piece of advice
that you would give somebody

922
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,657
who's starting a remote job?

923
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:08,385
Aurelie: Um, yeah. having a
journal like every day, Taking

924
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:11,535
notes, and sometimes revisit
your notes like maybe a week

925
00:55:11,535 --> 00:55:14,685
later,

926
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:18,878
two weeks later. and not
everything because you might not

927
00:55:18,938 --> 00:55:24,969
know what, why you are not in
that, but, um, some point you

928
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:27,413
will discover that it's probably
a good context for something.

929
00:55:27,413 --> 00:55:29,857
And

930
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:32,498
yeah, it's something that worked
well for me. Uh, sometimes it

931
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:34,897
was

932
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:39,159
like, okay. I w I need to take
that. I don't know why, but, and

933
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,468
it just, yeah, well, yeah, I
remember that from that day and

934
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:43,567
I

935
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:45,023
noted that, oh yeah, that's the
piece of information that I

936
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:46,478
need.

937
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:54,559
So yeah. I think the journal
helps and, um, that's it.

938
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:58,103
Dan: I love that. I think that's
great advice. It sounds, it

939
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,384
sounds really cool. It sounds
like a very good idea too, for

940
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:02,664
somebody new joining the team.

941
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:04,487
Bekah: All right. Well, thanks
so much Aurelie

942
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:05,811
