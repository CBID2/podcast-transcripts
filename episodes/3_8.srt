00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,498
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode eight of

2
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:13,086
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:16,775
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,326
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,265
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:25,175
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,025
you here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:32,865
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we sat
down with Aurelie Verrot. Aurelie

9
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,276
is a software engineer originally
from France, but who now lives in

10
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:40,625
the San Francisco bay area. Like
many of us Aurelie has been

11
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,746
working from home since the
pandemic started. And she shared

12
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,386
with us, some of her experiences,
uh, going through all that as

13
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:49,595
well as some important approaches
and habits, uh, that allow us to

14
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:51,066
be healthy and productive.

15
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,250
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,039
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. Today's

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
question is if you could be one
kind of plant, what would it be?

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:19,563
We hope you enjoy this episode.
Hi, I'm Bekah. I am a front end

20
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:25,293
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could be any kind

21
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:32,554
of plant, I would be, I really
want to say like Sequoia because

22
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,524
they're really tall and cool, but
I've never seen one in real life.

23
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:40,293
An aloe plant seems useful cause
they're healing, but like air

24
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:43,864
plants are really resilient and
they're tiny and you don't have

25
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,819
to do that much to take care of
it. And that, that also seems

26
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,118
good.

27
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,769
Dan: What was that? What kind of
plant is that

28
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,748
Bekah: An air plant.

29
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,019
Dan: Air plant?

30
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:51,938
Bekah: Yeah.

31
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,789
Dan: So like from a video game or
something,

32
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,578
Bekah: No, it's not from a video
game. It's like a real thing.

33
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,838
Dan: you know, aloe plants are
only healing. If you break off

34
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:04,858
the, you know, you have to
destroy the destroy, the plants,

35
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,239
get them, although that's a whole
different. Um, hi, I'm Dan. I am

36
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,049
a front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio. Um, if I could

37
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,269
be any kind of plant, I think
like, uh, like a maple tree or

38
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,919
something would be cool. Um, I
was really trying to think of all

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,368
the other kinds of plants that I
know, and I can only come up with

40
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:32,508
like three or four off the top of
my head. Uh, wouldn't want to be

41
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:36,146
like. Yeah, I think just going to
go with maple tree cause they're

42
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:39,776
cool. And like, plus it's on a,
that's on a whole country's flag,

43
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,866
you know, so that's cool too. So
that's going to be my

44
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:43,387
Bekah: So it'd

45
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:43,766
Dan: answer.

46
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:44,467
Bekah: like, oh,

47
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:45,236
Dan: That's right.

48
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,447
Bekah: the flag. It's not

49
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,366
Dan: Exactly.

50
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:48,067
Bekah: is me.

51
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:54,633
Aurelie: Hi, my name is I am from
the San Francisco bay area and I

52
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:02,014
am a software engineer. And, um,
if I I think I would be some kind

53
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,463
of lavender. I lived

54
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,408
Dan: That's a good one.

55
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:10,623
Aurelie: south of France for a
while, and I had like fields of

56
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:14,614
lavender everywhere. It's just my
favorite plant, I guess.

57
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,199
Dan: That's a good one. I like
that one.Lavender pretty and

58
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,799
like, and useful, you know,
that's, that's good. It's a good

59
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:23,158
combo.

60
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,593
Bekah: I have three lavender
plants in my front yard for the

61
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:35,739
first time. It did not die. So I
am very excited about it. Um, so

62
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,968
welcome. We are very,

63
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:37,364
Dan: Good.

64
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:42,098
Bekah: to have you here on the
podcast today. Um, and we always

65
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:46,748
like to start off the podcast
with your origin story. So how

66
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:51,188
did you get to where you are as a
software developer? Okay.

67
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:57,693
Aurelie: Yeah. So, um, I'm a
recent career changer. Um, so

68
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:02,563
before I was in quality safety
and then very much management, in

69
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:09,903
France. I moved in the US in 2015
and I couldn't work. Uh, because

70
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:16,144
of my visa. And so I took the
time to raise my kids and make

71
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:24,004
sure the family was fully
integrating new environment, um,

72
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:30,213
when I've been able to work. Um,
one thing I knew for sure that it

73
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:37,444
was that I didn't want to pursue
my previous career. So I try

74
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:42,163
different things. And at some
point, uh, I tried some coding

75
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:48,004
tutorials. Um, why that mostly
because my husband is an

76
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:54,394
engineer. And so I go to an easy
go-to I guess. Uh, and I liked

77
00:04:54,394 --> 00:05:00,033
it, uh, but it was like kind of
hard for me to learn by myself.

78
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,689
So at some point I decided to
join a bootcamp. And they did

79
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:14,718
yeah, two month and a half, three
months bootcamp, and then, um, a,

80
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:19,939
an internship for six months. And
then I found my first job and I

81
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:20,639
started in May.

82
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:25,692
Bekah: That's awesome. That seems
like a really fast journey. How

83
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,502
long did it take you? Um, from
the time you kind of started

84
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:36,692
Aurelie: I started mid 2019 with
my first. Yeah, my first

85
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:43,531
tutorials, like just learning
Ruby, running Java script. Um,

86
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:47,161
but I didn't really know what to
do with that. I mean, it was.

87
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:53,682
Kind of cool. I started to solve
some algorithm, but I couldn't

88
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:58,451
figure out how to use that, to
create like websites and

89
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:05,771
application and everything. So,
yeah. And I just tried to find my

90
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:11,247
answers, you know, Google, like
everybody else. And there was so

91
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:16,586
many information. I couldn't just
grip breast any, so yeah, I, at

92
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:23,786
some point just, I needed help
to, to learn, I guess, um, and

93
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:28,137
learning by myself. I know it's
not where I'm the strongest. So

94
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:33,266
yeah, I signed, I searched for
bootcamps that could allow me to

95
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:39,252
to take care of the kids and. And
also being able to travel to San

96
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:46,872
Francisco. Um, uh, yeah, and I
found one and I applied and it

97
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:52,302
went really fast. Yeah, for sure.
Uh, in like two months it took to

98
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:57,221
between the decision, finding the
bootcamp and passing all the

99
00:06:57,312 --> 00:07:02,951
interviews for the boot gym in
two months I was enrolled. So

100
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:03,221
yeah.

101
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,211
Bekah: What do you think? What
was the difference in learning

102
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:10,572
experience between learning on
your own and joining up?

103
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:18,526
Aurelie: Um, the problem I found
with learning on my own was

104
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:23,487
really this fire hose of
information. And about

105
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:27,206
everything. It's you search
something and you find something

106
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:32,026
for something for JavaScript, and
you find something for 5,000 for,

107
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:39,206
and you asked for some advice and
people will give you or an answer

108
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:43,047
with what they know. And
sometimes it's not what you are

109
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:50,036
working on. And for me, it was
just too hard to find. Really

110
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:56,607
focused on something. Um, I was
absorbing opinions from everybody

111
00:07:56,697 --> 00:08:02,877
and I just couldn't make my own
curriculum, you know, so having

112
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:08,666
something more structured and
also I think someone, um, I could

113
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:16,586
ask all my questions. Um, it was
something I thought will help me

114
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:22,706
better. So, yeah, it was, it was
really, it was better for me. And

115
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:27,867
also, so English is not my first
language. Um, when I started the

116
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:34,736
bootcamp, I was not super
confident with new talking

117
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:41,427
English. So I think someone will
take the time to talk with me to

118
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:47,246
understand where I don't
understand things and explain me

119
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:53,996
slowly. Um, some stuff, um, it
was really helpful. So yeah, I

120
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:58,677
really appreciated the bootcamp
for that. And I searched for

121
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:05,937
online, online bootcamp at first.
Um, but I realized that to learn

122
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:10,947
English, it was maybe easier for
me to have the person in front of

123
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:17,861
me and, you know, um, Reading
lips when people talk. So it

124
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,802
wasn't really easier for me to
have someone in front of me, like

125
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:23,741
a real person. Yeah.

126
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:28,981
Bekah: Yeah. absolutely. And so
your bootcamp was it a hybrid

127
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,881
bootcamp? Some, some of it was at
home. Some of it was on campus or

128
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:33,662
how was that structured?

129
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,182
Aurelie: So I chose an in-person
boot camp, so it was supposed to

130
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:43,922
be 12 weeks of in-person
bootcamp. And I started on

131
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:52,591
January 27th, 2020. So everybody
knows what happened in March. So,

132
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,761
so I did six weeks of in-person
and six weeks of our remote

133
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:05,532
learning because of COVID
restrictions. it was really

134
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:10,841
challenging, uh, to be honest,
uh, I really liked the, the

135
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:18,851
in-person way also because it
made me, um, meet a lot of people

136
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,841
that I wouldn't have met
otherwise, you know, when you're

137
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:30,721
a stay at home, mom, uh, you meet
moms and that's it. So yeah, in

138
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:35,187
the bootcamp really. A lot of
different people and it was

139
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,157
really great to have like the
backgrounds, they all have

140
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:42,986
different background and it was
great. It was really, um, helpful

141
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:48,626
for me to talk with these people.
Um, for me personally, and also

142
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:56,532
for, um, of the tech and, uh,
switching to remote. Well, first

143
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:01,091
I had to, you know, you have to
adjust and also we didn't have

144
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:06,672
this. Um, the connection that we
had before discussions were

145
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:12,402
mostly on slack. People didn't
have time, even me to like, do

146
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:18,101
some zoom meeting after classes.
So it was really different. Yeah.

147
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:24,642
Well, less than directions. Um,
but it went well. Uh, in the end,

148
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:30,851
yeah, I really missed like, uh,
the social part it, which is

149
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:35,652
strange because I'm usually
someone who like, loves to live

150
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:43,062
in a cave and, uh, talk to
nobody. But I guess, I guess it

151
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:44,831
changed me. So yeah.

152
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,321
Dan: Yeah. I feel like a lot of
us learned some stuff about

153
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:51,441
ourselves when the, when the
pandemic started and all the

154
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,910
quarantine stuff happened, you
know?

155
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:53,910
Aurelie: Yeah.

156
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,910
Dan: You know, my, my natural
thing is like, oh, I hate people.

157
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,600
I don't want to be anywhere.
know, the same thing live in a

158
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,451
cave, you know? And then all of a
sudden when you're forced to not

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,745
ever see anybody, it's like, oh,
No, it turns out I actually do,

160
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:10,336
like, people might not like, you
know, lots and lots of people or

161
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:14,535
anything, but, uh, yeah. It's,
uh, I don't know. That was, that

162
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,576
was an experience. I'm sure it
actually had probably, uh, well,

163
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,916
I don't, I was going to say I'm
sure. I don't know if I'm sure,

164
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,755
but, um, fact that you started
your class kind of started all

165
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:26,015
together. Um, and you had six
weeks. Is that what you said

166
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:30,365
before? Uh, before, uh, you know,
the quarantine started? So that

167
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,615
probably helped a little bit. I
mean, you at least knew the

168
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:36,515
teacher and you knew, um, the,
your classmates and stuff I

169
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:40,865
imagine was much harder. Um, you
know, starting from, from scratch

170
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,186
in that, in that situation.

171
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:46,696
Aurelie: Yeah, for sure. I don't
think I would have, um,

172
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:52,966
succeeded. Um, yeah, maybe at
all. If it was online, heard

173
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:58,395
many. Um, people talk to me about
the same, uh, boot camp I did,

174
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:05,806
but online, completely online.
And, um, I, I think you need some

175
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:14,505
skills, like self skills and
everything, to really succeed

176
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:21,240
kind of online training. And
these skills, I don't have them,

177
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,791
I guess, or maybe not enough. I
don't know.

178
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,201
Dan: It's definitely interesting.
I don't know if I would, I mean,

179
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,530
skills is an interesting word,
but there's everybody kind of

180
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,015
learns differently. Right. And
so, uh, it's, it's more. W what

181
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:42,275
were your sort of what you're
suited to? Right. And, and I

182
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:45,485
don't, I mean, I don't learn from
lectures really, or people

183
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,576
talking, you know, but of course
I have the same issue with video

184
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:55,926
Uh, I, I have problems. I dunno.
Um, I don't know what the right

185
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:59,556
word is, but, uh, I, I don't, um,
the information doesn't stick in

186
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:04,596
my brain, right. until I do
things, but the self guided stuff

187
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:10,115
only works for me personally. Uh,
when I am super into whatever it

188
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,846
is, you know, I always.
Personally I'm self-taught, but

189
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,816
like I said, I'm self-taught, as
in like, I'd learned things but

190
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:20,296
bit at a time, you know, bits at
a time, as I things that interest

191
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:26,296
me in college or whatever, like w
in my free time, uh, and the idea

192
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:30,556
of trying to do that from scratch
now seems horrifying. So I can

193
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:36,255
totally relate to like, wanting
to, um, the lesson planning and

194
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,936
stuff like that, that you can
kind of, kind of talked about.

195
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:42,600
And the, I would have no idea
what. To do or even, to tell

196
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,941
somebody what to do, you know, if
somebody is like, oh, I want to

197
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:50,091
learn to be a developer. What
should I learn? You know, think I

198
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,081
would, I'd be like, I have no
idea. know, learn stuff. It seems

199
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,240
really hard to, to, to do all on
your own, like entirely on your

200
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,500
own. Um,

201
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,301
Aurelie: Yeah.

202
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:02,671
Dan: at least.

203
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,471
Aurelie: I'm the same, I think
also that need, like, it's not

204
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:14,931
that I need some guidance all the
way, but I think for, um, to

205
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:22,155
start, I need someone to guide me
when I start and I need to. Maybe

206
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:27,466
show that I, I, I need to show
someone that I understood

207
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:35,505
something and to me the go to be
like maybe more confident and

208
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:42,375
then such sort by myself. But
yeah, I. I like to have like

209
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:47,775
person saying, okay, this, you
know, now you know how to do it.

210
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:53,416
You do it well. So go ahead and
do more that I need, I guess.

211
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,250
Bekah: Yeah. Even being in a
traditional classroom, you can,

212
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,530
when you see other students. It's
kind of acts as a gut check,

213
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,755
right? Like if you're like, wow,
I'm really confused. Should I be

214
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,005
confused or other people like you
look around and you're like,

215
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,855
okay, that person definitely
looks confused too. So like, in

216
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,556
that sense, like there's a,
there's some community and that

217
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,576
kind of enables you to think
like, okay, well we're in this

218
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,946
together. We all need to figure
this out. So let's ask some

219
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:22,995
questions or, um, like, okay, I'm
not the only one that's having

220
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:25,515
this experience right now. And
just like having that community

221
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:29,145
support, whether it's for a gut
check or to say like, yeah, this

222
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:33,010
is. It's tough, but you're doing
a good job. Just keep at it. But

223
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,341
sometimes that's all you need,
but when you're yourself and

224
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,331
there's so much information,
there's, it's oversaturated

225
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,321
amount of information, like you
said, some of it's good. Some of

226
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:46,061
it's not, some of it can apply to
what you're working on. Some of

227
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,451
them, you don't recognize that
you can't apply it yet. Um,

228
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,890
because there are simple things
able to hear other people talk

229
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,105
about that, to ask questions and
to see, um, How, how people are

230
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:04,726
working through things can be,
um, a huge game changer for that.

231
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,961
Aurelie: Yeah. And I had this
experience. We had some exercise,

232
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,201
um, like we were trying to, I
don't know, create like a new

233
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:21,750
feature in class and there was
this kind of, um, algorithm to

234
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:28,000
solve for that. I know that by
myself, I wouldn't have been able

235
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,480
to do it and other people, uh, as
well, but I had some, um,

236
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,240
understanding that helped them.
So there things as well, and

237
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:44,141
altogether, we were able to
deliver something that was

238
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:48,641
watching really well. So I think
this is important as well to

239
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:54,026
have. People around you and, um,
people you can talk to and

240
00:17:54,026 --> 00:18:01,375
exchange you spend way less time
to solve problem. And, um, and

241
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,915
these less frustrating in the
end. So yeah, I think the

242
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:11,006
learning experience is maybe
better by the way. I mean, but

243
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:15,096
like you said, then maybe for
some people, some people are able

244
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:19,665
to learn as well by themself and
I admire that.

245
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,112
Bekah: I think it's good practice
though, to be able to learn with

246
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:27,531
other people. Because when you go
out and start working, you're

247
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,412
probably going to be working with
team of people. And the more

248
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,442
comfortable you are communicating
about things and asking

249
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:37,491
questions, it's going to be
overall. I think for like being a

250
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,551
part of a team, especially it's a
remote team,

251
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:48,771
Aurelie: Yeah. That's something
that I wasn't used to do my

252
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:55,432
previous career. It was more like
have one task to do and you have

253
00:18:55,432 --> 00:19:02,221
to do it by yourself and the
Festus. And people were not

254
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:07,122
really, don't know, available to
help or things like that. You

255
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:11,926
didn't just. you didn't ask
actually. And so this is

256
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:17,596
something that I've learned,
with, with, coding. You have ask,

257
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:22,096
have to ask for help. You have to
ask for people to test your

258
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:25,817
thing. You have a, yeah, you have
to ask for reviews, you have to

259
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:34,606
ask to call So out to people and
say, Hey, uh, either someone to

260
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:39,632
review what I've done or. I don't
know what to do and I need help

261
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:44,521
and something that I really
learned. Um, yeah. When I started

262
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:50,818
coding, uh, it, something that
made me, a lot uncomfortable at

263
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:57,719
first, uh, to be honest, because
I like to be the person who is

264
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:03,028
expert on something. And I, I
like to be the one with the

265
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:08,773
answers. Instead of asking them,
but yeah, I changed now. I'm

266
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,213
asking questions all the time.

267
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:13,824
Bekah: I totally feel

268
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:13,973
Dan: Yeah.

269
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,124
Bekah: And, you know, as a career
changer too, and coming from an

270
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:20,963
experience where I was the one
with all the answers having no

271
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:24,564
support from other people, it
definitely was a hurdle to get

272
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:27,834
through. And, you know, I taught
English for a lot of years and

273
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,263
would always be like, wow, I bet
you are a really good

274
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:35,608
communicator. Just a very
different role and I was not used

275
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:39,298
to communicating in that way. So
no, I wasn't, I'm working on it

276
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,818
though, you know, um, it is
almost a new skillset to be able

277
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:51,659
to communicate in that way and to
ask those questions, um, I want

278
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,048
to kind of the conversation a
little bit, because you talked

279
00:20:55,048 --> 00:21:00,808
about, you enjoyed being
in-person for bootcamp, and now

280
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:04,648
you're working a remote position.
And so like, I'd love to hear

281
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:10,798
your take on that transition and
in why you chose remote work over

282
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:14,429
being in person you liked the
in-person bootcamp. So.

283
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:22,513
Aurelie: Yeah. So I discovered
that it's not really. Um, being

284
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:27,703
in an office with people that I
like, it's more, more of the

285
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:34,483
interaction interactions with
people. Um, and I think working

286
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:41,054
remote remotely is not a barrier.
I mean, a blocker for, um, team

287
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:46,183
communication and having fun with
your team and yeah. And having,

288
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:54,338
yeah, great exchange and. Um, and
also I'm a mom, kids, and I need

289
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:59,078
to be available and working
remotely is the easiest for me to

290
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:06,548
be able to continue to try them
to the doctor or to whatever

291
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:13,058
activities they have. Um, I like
to be here. When thing, when do

292
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:17,249
you come back from school? And if
they have one more. I don't want

293
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:22,378
to just run all the time. It's
something that I did when I was

294
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:26,519
in friends. I was working full
time from eight to six, uh,

295
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:31,169
picked up the kids at the nanny's
house at six, and then you just

296
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,628
had to run to run, to run. And
it's honestly, it's just not the

297
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:44,328
life. Um, and yeah, since I had
the opportunity to change my

298
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:50,384
career, Why not changing the way
I was working. And, um, so yeah,

299
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:59,773
uh, something that I decided like
early. Um, I, I, I wanted to work

300
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:04,814
from home. Uh, that was the
easiest for me. So, yeah. And

301
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:11,773
what I experienced today in my
team, um, I mean, we have great

302
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:18,763
way to interact. Um, with each
other, we have one-on-ones we

303
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:25,304
have coffee breaks. have, um,
what we have team lunch, uh, like

304
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:31,003
every Thursday we, we, we eat
together and, yeah, it's great.

305
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:37,183
And we have a lot of varying, um,
session if we want to. And yeah,

306
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:44,294
so it's really not about just
being the office. It's just. How

307
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:47,624
you want to create relationship
with your teammates, you know,

308
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:54,314
and yeah. So far it's been three
months now that I'm full-time

309
00:23:54,314 --> 00:24:00,703
remote and, uh, yeah, I think
I've made the choice. I really

310
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:01,094
like it.

311
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:05,483
Dan: Is everybody on your team?
Uh, full-time remote.

312
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:10,463
Aurelie: Yes. We are all four
remotes. Uh, we are all

313
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:19,483
mostly...We are all in the U S.
Um, so I'm in, I mean, the team

314
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:26,054
that is separated do teams. My
team is only in the us and the

315
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:34,273
other little team is, uh, Um, so
yeah, and it, for example, it's

316
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:39,884
another challenge. Uh, we had
like a summit for, um, our team

317
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:44,773
that is called an organization.
And, uh, we had to have everybody

318
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:49,903
on zoom at the same time. And so
we had people during the day, we

319
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:56,818
had people during the night. But,
um, yeah, it's I, and I think

320
00:24:56,818 --> 00:25:01,949
people are willing to do that
because everything, everything is

321
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:06,719
great and we have great
relationship between us. So,

322
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:11,669
yeah, it's, uh, it's great. Maybe
next time it will be us in us

323
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,858
that will have to be up at night.
We'll see.

324
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,969
Bekah: Okay. I think that's such
a great point that you made about

325
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,159
it's it's about the
relationships, right? It's not

326
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,959
necessarily about the place,
right? You are because there can

327
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,219
be various successful remote
teams, fully remote teams, and

328
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:34,638
there can be very successful in
person teams and, and there can

329
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:38,324
be, you know, Ones that are not
successful at all. And it just

330
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:42,703
depends on, you know, how are you
building your team? What, how are

331
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:46,993
you creating the relationships or
the other people and like

332
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:52,394
recognizing them as, a person and
not just somebody that's got to

333
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:56,203
get this work done. Um, and so I
think that's so important when

334
00:25:56,203 --> 00:26:01,898
people say, well, you can't have
the same relationship. On remote

335
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:06,909
teams that you can in person. And
for me, I found way more value in

336
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:11,888
the remote teams that I've been
on I ever have my in-person

337
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,949
teams. And I think it's just
really about, you know, what,

338
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,108
what is the value of that team?

339
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:25,138
Aurelie: Yeah. I never believed
in the, you know, these companies

340
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:30,808
will have like foosball and ping
pong tables and stuff like that

341
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:36,959
to create a environment. It's not
about that. You can have like as

342
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:41,249
many foosball table you want and
your people won't talk to each

343
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:46,384
other. So it's not something I
really believe in. And, um, I

344
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:52,413
mean, if the leadership like is
willing to show that they are,

345
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:57,844
uh, okay with being remote, that
there are, um, the way that

346
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:03,818
they're communicating with each
other is. Remotely. And sometimes

347
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:09,878
they organize fun things. Every
people, uh, in the Yarki will do

348
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,858
it because we do just what the
leadership does. That's that's

349
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:21,398
the way people work. So, yeah.
And if your company is organizing

350
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:27,009
great events, just to have people
talking to each other and meet,

351
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:31,253
um, whatever the. Department they
are working on and everything. I

352
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:35,394
think this is how you create work
relationship with anybody in the

353
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:40,374
company. And for example, my
company, um, last week or two

354
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:44,513
weeks ago, I don't remember. Um,
they're organized like every

355
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:48,443
trimester, uh, what they call
table four six. So you have to

356
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:53,064
register in advance. They have
like a list of people and people

357
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:56,874
that are randomly chosen. They
create a table. So it's a zoom

358
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:02,979
room. And they give you like a
budget to, uh, order something

359
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:07,808
with door dash and you are eating
your lunch with people you

360
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:12,939
wouldn't have worked with maybe.
So. Yeah, it's a, I think that's

361
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:18,489
the kind of evidence that needs
to happen if you want your, your

362
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,338
employees to just have great
relationship relationship with

363
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:22,398
it.

364
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:25,537
Dan: I think that's really cool.
I was going to ask, you had

365
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,797
mentioned that you got your, your
S your small team does like every

366
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:32,166
week, right? I mean, it's kind of
eat together kind of thing.

367
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:32,767
Aurelie: Yeah.

368
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:36,696
Dan: think that's. Is there any
other, um, sort of, not like the

369
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:40,866
big summit level stuff, but, uh,
any sort of week-to-week stuff

370
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:46,146
that, um, that your team does or,
the organization does to improve,

371
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,436
you know, your communications in
near relationships, um, on your

372
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:50,676
team.

373
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:57,192
Aurelie: Yeah. So, um, well, in
my team, we have like a wall to

374
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:04,717
have like least one SU meeting
altogether. So when we don't have

375
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:07,896
any new organized, like a coffee
break or something like that,

376
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:11,707
it's short, but it's just, Hey,
what did you do this weekend? And

377
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:15,307
blah, blah, blah. So this is
something that we do. We also

378
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:21,997
have, we also use the new feature
from slack, the slack huddle. So

379
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:28,356
we use that mostly to talk with
all the We have, like Melbourne

380
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:35,946
or Singapore. Then, um, what else
do they do? So, yeah, there's the

381
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:42,606
table four, six. There's a, the
end cred. Oh, okay. So onboarding

382
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:48,876
process. Um, we are, um, in teams
during the onboarding process.

383
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:52,942
And so we have like some
activities. I'll just call that

384
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,461
company and everything and they
encourage us to just stay in

385
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,031
contact. So like every month,
month and a half, I have this

386
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:06,602
meeting with my team that I
onboard with. And, um, so it's,

387
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:10,471
you know, it's tiny things like
that. They also organize like,

388
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:17,551
um, My company works a lot with
charities. They encourage

389
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:22,592
volunteering they encourage
people to rope together to do

390
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:27,142
some volunteering as well. So
it's all the things that they

391
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:33,571
are. I think they are trying to,
uh, find, um, ways for people to,

392
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:41,392
um, to show their common interest
and build on that. I think it's

393
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:46,852
yeah, it's a great idea. They
have a, yeah. And we have also,

394
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:53,092
um, like societies they call
them, that, so for example, we

395
00:30:53,092 --> 00:31:00,112
have like, uh, Um, society for
women, for women in engineering,

396
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:07,976
for parents, for people from the,
uh, LGBTQA, uh, community, it's,

397
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:14,131
uh, it it's great. And, um, To
try to yeah. To build on that and

398
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:20,020
think this is how you make people
talk to each other. Yes. Yeah.

399
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,590
Dan: I think that's really cool.
My, uh, yeah, my wife works for

400
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,050
Teach for America and they do,
they have a lot of stuff in it.

401
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:34,070
Similar, similar kinds of things,
you know, um, that they do to

402
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,861
sort of promote, um,
interpersonal relationships, you

403
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,671
know, on their teams. Uh,
sometimes I think they might go

404
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:45,020
overboard. You know, they spend,
you know, a lot of time on zoom,

405
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,260
um, altogether, but it's, it's
cool. And, and I mean, and she

406
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,721
loves her team too, you know, and
they, they, they're all, they're

407
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,881
all spread all over the place and
all remote and everything too.

408
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:58,211
It's very cool. And I, I feel
like it is it's, uh, important to

409
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,171
that's one of the things that
some parts of it happened

410
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,260
automatic or can happen
automatically when you're all in

411
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,911
the same you know? Uh, and
obviously there's plenty of

412
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:15,431
unhealthy in the world, but like
it's, I feel like it takes more

413
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:19,976
concerted effort. Um, When
you're, um, you know, on a remote

414
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:23,665
team, um, to do that sort of
thing, because it's easy to into

415
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:28,405
cave, cave person mode. Right.
Um, and think the thing you said

416
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:31,405
at the beginning when I asked
this question was about how a lot

417
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:36,885
of it comes from leadership. Um,
uh, I just want to just touch on

418
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,046
that again, because I feel like
that's, that's really true and

419
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:42,165
it's important, you know, if, if
leadership is like, make some

420
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:45,195
sort of rule that everybody has
to do something, but doesn't, you

421
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:48,855
know, don't participate in it or
anything. Um, I feel like lots of

422
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:54,016
times that ends up just causing
resentment at best and doesn't

423
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,016
actually promote, you know, uh,
any, any So I think that's really

424
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,796
cool that the is sort of part of
this whole process. Yeah.

425
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:08,596
Aurelie: Yeah. And also we are,
um, So we have offices the world.

426
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:14,776
We have employees all over the
world and some rules are in place

427
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:20,685
as well to, um, to make sure that
people who are not on us time

428
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:26,266
zones also feel part of the
company, you know? And, um, I

429
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:30,615
think that's, that's, great. We
have like all important meetings

430
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:36,655
have to be recorded. That way, if
someone is on another time zone

431
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:42,296
and can join, or even if someone
has an emergency at home and they

432
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:46,195
have to pick up their kids, they
can still have all the

433
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:50,635
information that has been shared
during the meeting. And I think

434
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:57,536
it's a game changer when people
do that. Remote work is really

435
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:06,155
possible. Otherwise, I, I don't
know. Yeah. If your job is only

436
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:12,036
for us market, maybe it's easier,
but as long, I mean, if it's from

437
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:18,576
somewhere else or you have people
working from elsewhere, you have

438
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:22,115
to implement these things in your
house, you have to force it.

439
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:26,885
Otherwise, like you said, the
first thing people do usually is

440
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,876
just to KV.

441
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:34,061
Bekah: And it's nice too. When
you, when you have communities of

442
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:39,581
belonging, where you have shared
interests, easier to learn more

443
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:43,181
about so many there. And then
also to like branch out beyond

444
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,440
that, because when you have an
environment that, know, feels.

445
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,530
One, like you're comfortable
there, there are these people

446
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,041
around you that you trust and,
you know, and they'll have

447
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:57,431
different overlapping communities
then you would have to. And so

448
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,400
then there just becomes this,
like, know, you have these sub

449
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,900
communities, but then it all
works together to feel to create

450
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,641
something that's like this, this
nice big. Supportive community

451
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:14,471
that allows you to do, So much
more because when, when you feel

452
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:17,260
safe in a space, when you know
that you can trust those people,

453
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,030
then you're more likely to grow
and to take chances or risks or

454
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:28,606
be innovative, um, and and move
faster. It's funny. Yeah. That

455
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,956
it's not more highly valued on
teams like, oh, well, that's,

456
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:36,226
that's not, um, it's not a
valuable thing that doesn't help

457
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:41,925
us with our product, but, but it
does because of the side effects

458
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:50,885
of having a supportive place. Um,
so I know that there are

459
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:55,916
certainly lots of people out
there that. Are not interested in

460
00:35:55,945 --> 00:36:00,596
remote work, um, narrow struggles
that are associated with it as

461
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:04,286
well. I know for me, you know, I,
I work remotely and I don't have

462
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,346
an office space. So sometimes
it's like really hard for me to

463
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:12,865
stop. I'm well, the computer's
there and the kids are playing on

464
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:17,936
the sit down and do this one more
thing. w have you found to be

465
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:21,356
useful to kind of some of those
struggles?

466
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:29,646
Aurelie: So I have to get, we
live in a two bedroom apartment,

467
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:38,976
um, and my kids have been, uh, at
remote school, um, all year, last

468
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:48,056
year. Uh, so. Yes, there are
struggles when you want to, to

469
00:36:48,056 --> 00:37:00,965
work from home, especially today.
Um, so it's it. I mean, you can

470
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:04,835
do just what you can do with what
you have and the time that you

471
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:09,456
have. So instead of stressing
about having like a super

472
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:17,005
private. Room for yourself with
closed doors and just try to

473
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:23,695
make, I mean, try to use what you
have and just work on that. I

474
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:30,865
changed my, uh, desk space like
four times last year. And I

475
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:36,445
finally find my corner, you know,
it's not, I mean, I'm, I mean the

476
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:43,661
living room, so, um, Yeah, with
the kids. It wasn't easy. At some

477
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,320
point we were four people in your
apartment having zoom meetings at

478
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,170
the same time. Um, you adjusts. I
mean, especially, I think it's

479
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:59,800
even easier now before. I don't
think people were really, um,

480
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,780
inclined to understand that maybe
you have a dog, maybe you have a

481
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:10,376
kid, maybe you haven't even baby,
uh, or even. And there are only

482
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:16,556
people that you have to take care
of. Um, now the understand better

483
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:21,295
what it is because people were
forced to work from home. And I

484
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:26,996
think this is when, if, if you
really want to work from from

485
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:31,286
home. Um, this is when you can
find your thing without really

486
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:36,476
stressing out about it. So at
first, like for example, I was in

487
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:40,510
the middle of the living room and
I had to get. Passing behind me

488
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:48,340
all the time. Uh, well, I can do
anything. I can, I mean, take my

489
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,990
kids against the wall, just for
them to not walk behind me, you

490
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,681
know? So yeah, just try, just to
do with what you have. Zoom can

491
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:04,780
allow you to put backgrounds,
just use that and your kids.

492
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:12,065
Well, My experience, my kids. So
they are 12 and 10. So obviously

493
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:16,476
it's easier than with little
kids. I don't really have the

494
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:23,405
experience with little kids, but
at least with my kids, uh, just

495
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:28,896
told them that what I was doing
was important and what I was

496
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:35,981
doing will maybe make us have one
day. I think it house like with

497
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,391
maybe I will have my office and
they will have their own bedroom

498
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:46,150
and they won't have to run behind
me all the time. And, but if

499
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:53,365
nobody is making any effort now,
Maybe what happened. So this is

500
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:57,326
what I try to explain them. And
they Enough to understand that.

501
00:39:57,385 --> 00:40:02,096
And so we try to establish rules
and every week we weren't

502
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:06,596
changing the world because we
tried something and it was not

503
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:13,561
adapted. And so we had to change
and, uh, but yeah, it's just. At

504
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:17,940
first, I was like super stressed
and I didn't want anybody to be

505
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,311
on camera and everything. it was
just impossible and it made me

506
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,240
really nervous. And like, for
example, during the bootcamp, my

507
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,900
son really wanted to uh, who was
my instructor. And so it was on

508
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,610
the, like on the couch with me.
And it was like, Just his head.

509
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,150
So at first it was just the hair
and then the nose and then the

510
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:52,831
full face. And you, you can't
avoid that. Um, but yeah, so I, I

511
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,010
w R reviewed the rules like
multiple times. I tried to

512
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:05,951
organize their schedule mine to
make sure that at least. Um, I

513
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:09,490
had one moment in the morning and
one moment in the afternoon with

514
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:15,521
a quiet time where I could set up
like some zoom meetings and I

515
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:22,090
mean the most important ones, um,
a good pair of headphones. I

516
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:30,731
mean, a lot of tools exist, um,
just to, to do that better, but

517
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,565
yeah. I mean, unless you are
already working in a company that

518
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:41,606
will give you a steep end to buy
a set of new monitors and

519
00:41:41,606 --> 00:41:46,195
everything. Well, fine. Just do
that. But if you can't, you just,

520
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:55,436
and also one thing that was, um,
important decide of the material

521
00:41:55,646 --> 00:42:02,155
aspect and organize it or the
musician or more like aspect? Um,

522
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:07,976
communication when I was in
projects during the bootcamps

523
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:12,806
and, uh, they wanted to, uh, code
all weekend for eight hours a

524
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:19,106
day. Sorry, I can't, I can't,
give you three hours in the

525
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:22,976
morning and I can give you three
hours in the afternoon that's it.

526
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:28,376
Because after that I need to
cook, I maybe I need to take care

527
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:32,945
of my kids. Maybe I need you to
tell me also, you know, Mean,

528
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:39,255
yeah. So just being clear with
people, Maybe some people will

529
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:43,155
have some expectations from you
and you just have to be really,

530
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:52,096
um, um, I mean, just tell the
truth and say that things maybe

531
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:58,005
won't happen like that. And as
soon as you, mean, the sooner you

532
00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:03,706
that the less struggles and
blockers and frustration it

533
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:11,201
creates, so. My only, yeah, I
think my only advice is just let

534
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:11,621
it go.

535
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:16,496
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's such
good advice, you know, and I

536
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:20,385
don't know if this is a mom thing
or not, but I know at least a lot

537
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:24,365
of moms that I know now we, we do
a lot because we have to do a

538
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:28,235
lot. Right. And so. then we, we
want to continue to do things

539
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:32,135
that we enjoy doing or that we've
done before really well. it's

540
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:35,585
really hard. Sometimes it just
doesn't happen. Or sometimes like

541
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,135
we're in a different stage of
life and we need to let those

542
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:41,561
things go and it can be really
hard. To do that because you're

543
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,981
like, well, I enjoyed this or I
could be good at this, or I will

544
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:49,150
have enough time, I think you're
right. Saying like have clear

545
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,351
communication about things and be
okay with communicating that. So,

546
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:57,615
I mean, and that's another thing
that goes. Creating trust. You

547
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:01,456
know, if you are, if you don't
just keep pushing through, just

548
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:06,436
be open to begin with and like, I
can do a little bit, but no, I

549
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,795
can not do that. And so. there's,
like the clear communication

550
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:12,516
there's boundaries, your setting,
but then also talking about being

551
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,815
flexible with things because you
can try it things it doesn't

552
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:19,505
work. And just having that
self-awareness I think a great.

553
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:24,581
too, to be able to work with
different groups of people and to

554
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,201
with your team and, and make sure
that, everybody knows where

555
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:33,400
you're at, because that's what,
you know, that's, that's what,

556
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,170
creates good team.

557
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:42,360
Aurelie: Yeah, I think so. I
think so. Um, my resentfully, so

558
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:49,036
my kids find any return to
school. Uh, and so I have to

559
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,695
drive one, uh, in the morning
because it was cool. It was

560
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:58,396
really far away. And also, I
think he's too little to go by

561
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:04,335
himself. Um, so I ha I I've just
told my kid and my kids, my CMS,

562
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:11,536
um, yeah, starting um, August
11th, I won't be able to accept

563
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:16,666
any zoom meeting at eight. It
will be eight 30. That's it, I

564
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:22,365
mean, and nobody said, oh my
gosh, Nope. Everybody say, oh

565
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:27,766
yeah, of course. That's it's.
Yeah. So I think sometimes we are

566
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:34,059
most stressed about saying the
thing more than really. Yeah. too

567
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,489
much, I guess.

568
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:39,554
Bekah: That's for sure. Well, I
think, you know, all of these

569
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:44,353
things that you've talked about
it, think one of the benefits of.

570
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:48,974
COVID and the pandemic and stuff
is, is that people are more open

571
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:53,023
and willing to this. And I mean,
moms have been impacted, I think,

572
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:55,873
more than any other group or
they're very high up on the list,

573
00:45:56,264 --> 00:46:01,423
but you know, I also think that
it's good that eventually, I

574
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,914
think there'll be more
opportunities for moms because

575
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:09,059
things like this are regular.
Like it's okay to have. On your

576
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,048
screen. okay to say I have to
take my kids somewhere. And in

577
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:16,349
some sense, it's normalize this
and hopefully that's something

578
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:21,478
that we forward because remote
work is that that's what makes

579
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,949
things doable for me as well, to
be able to take kids the doctor's

580
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,628
or to a field trip or, you know,
whatever is, something that I,

581
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:33,958
that I want to be doing. And I'm
glad that I have that ability to

582
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:41,923
do that and to, you know, be able
to. Take that time and, and not

583
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:46,963
have to in my car for a really
long commute somewhere. I knew a

584
00:46:46,963 --> 00:46:51,224
mom that was looking for work,
um, pre COVID and she was looking

585
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:54,074
for her first job. And she said,
well, the only one that I was

586
00:46:54,074 --> 00:47:00,224
offered is a two hour commute,
two hours each way gets it's not

587
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:02,744
worth it. It is not worth that

588
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:03,528
Aurelie: No.

589
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:06,539
Bekah: is not that great. And I
don't, I don't know. I feel like

590
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:10,139
it's ridiculous for anyone to ask
somebody to commute that like,

591
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,768
that's a, that's a red flag in my
mouth. Like yeah. Spend all that

592
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:14,728
time in your car

593
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,289
Aurelie: Well, it's a,

594
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:17,128
Bekah: could work from home.

595
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,298
Aurelie: yeah, it's something
that we know a lot here in the,

596
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:24,958
in the barrier, because you have
a lot of people, you know,

597
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:29,548
working for like the giants, like
Google and apple Facebook. And,

598
00:47:30,509 --> 00:47:35,159
but they can. I mean, they are
old enough to have kids and so

599
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:40,438
they can have a roommate. So they
have to live far away where

600
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:46,708
prices are I guess, to live. So I
know many people doing like two

601
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:51,119
hours come here, morning and
afternoon. And it's, I think it's

602
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,728
just crazy. And I'm glad for them
that we are in remote days and

603
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:59,789
now they are just working from
home and everything is fine.

604
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:04,889
Dan: had, you know, when you're
talking about sort of breaking up

605
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,429
your. Hours of your day or
whatever. I kind of touched on

606
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:11,708
it, but I was one I wanted, I was
wondering if you could talk a

607
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:15,699
little bit about how you between
work and also taking care of, you

608
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:19,778
know, your family and everything.
Um, if you ha how you kind of,

609
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:24,219
um, build any habits or anything
for self care and, you know, like

610
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:27,998
staying healthy and stuff like
that. Uh, if you, if you, if you

611
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:30,668
have anything, you know, any tips
or anything like that, I could

612
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:31,239
probably use some.

613
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,554
Aurelie: I don't know if I have
good tips for that. But so

614
00:48:35,554 --> 00:48:39,454
actually it was really funny
because when I was a stay at

615
00:48:39,454 --> 00:48:45,818
home, mom, I never found time to
do anything like at all. And

616
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:53,438
since I work, I trained almost
seven hours a week. I don't know.

617
00:48:54,159 --> 00:49:01,789
Um, yeah, I don't know. It's just
a F yeah, no, I don't have any

618
00:49:01,878 --> 00:49:08,478
tips. It's just, uh, if I want, I
know that like hour I need to,

619
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:15,563
um, to go out of my desk and just
take few steps. Just because, you

620
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:18,684
know, it's good for your eyes.
It's for your brain is good for

621
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:25,074
whatever. And so it's like, oh, I
need to the, I dunno, the

622
00:49:25,074 --> 00:49:29,364
dishwashers. I will do that. And
in the meantime, I will do some

623
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:34,313
stuff and come back to my desk.
And so it's something that I

624
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:42,233
tried to do, like every hour, um,
training, uh, do I train so much?

625
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:48,708
Um, probably because. Hey for
someone, some coaching. So it's,

626
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,619
it's a good motivator.

627
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:54,244
Dan: Are they scheduled? I mean,
is it, so if you're paying

628
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,224
somebody, so is it like it's on
the calendar

629
00:49:57,278 --> 00:49:58,929
Aurelie: uh,

630
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:02,503
Dan: yeah.

631
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:09,188
Aurelie: watch, uh, they won't
check when I do they can check if

632
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,469
I've done all my trainings,
every.

633
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:12,753
Dan: Okay.

634
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:20,393
Aurelie: and then it's just to
me. Um, so I try to like early in

635
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:23,844
the morning to do my training
before working. It just doesn't

636
00:50:23,844 --> 00:50:26,844
work, especially since the kids
are returning to school is just

637
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:34,403
it's too much. So I do that. know
that, uh, uh, when the kids are

638
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:43,614
eating because we make our kids.
It's um, together. And then I,

639
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:48,293
with my husband, we eat later,
like that's weekend have a sense

640
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:56,574
of, uh, you know, of, uh, um, no
date night, just night time for

641
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:57,264
adults, you know?

642
00:50:57,684 --> 00:50:58,643
Dan: Adult conversations.

643
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,284
Aurelie: Yeah, I don't
conversation. That's right. Uh,

644
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:06,054
so yeah, I, when they are eating
I train and so yeah, when they

645
00:51:06,054 --> 00:51:14,034
are eating their rice, I'm
squatting. No, I don't. I mean,

646
00:51:14,034 --> 00:51:19,251
yeah. I, I don't, I don't have
really any advice. I don't know

647
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:23,541
if you think you can do it in the
morning, just, just what's your,

648
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:28,702
I don't know, your alarm clock
earlier or do it just no

649
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:32,242
pressure. And sometimes I don't
do it. And the next day I will do

650
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,811
two trainings. That's why, I
mean,

651
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,771
Dan: I liked your, I liked your
approach with the concern of

652
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:41,411
getting up through that
throughout the day as well. Um,

653
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:45,226
and that like throwing in the
light. grabbing a couple of

654
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:48,646
chores, you know, or whatever in
the meantime, or, or doing that

655
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:50,835
sort of thing. I think that's
cool. I think that's a cool

656
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:51,315
approach.

657
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:54,596
Aurelie: It's really something
that I love with remote working

658
00:51:54,746 --> 00:52:00,547
is being able to sprinkle the
chores. During the day like that,

659
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:06,306
it's not just a block up. I need
to clean today. No, you, you that

660
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:06,612
Dan: Yeah.

661
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:07,117
Aurelie: you know,

662
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:07,416
Bekah: Yeah.

663
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,197
Aurelie: when you think about it
and it's, it's great like that.

664
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:16,717
So sometimes I'm like, have
laundry to fold and I have my

665
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,766
tests running on the, on the
monitor. so while the tests are

666
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,106
running, I'm folding some
t-shirts.

667
00:52:25,657 --> 00:52:25,896
Bekah: I think

668
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:26,092
Aurelie: That's

669
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:27,262
Dan: That's a really good idea.

670
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:28,027
Bekah: Twitter.

671
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:35,061
Aurelie: I, I just tried to be
chill and the more chill I am and

672
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:40,581
the most I do. So I guess, eh,
maybe it's my advice. Just be

673
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:41,512
chill.

674
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:50,121
Bekah: Well, I think in the moms
in tech, um, Meet up that you a

675
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:53,181
couple of weeks ago, you were
talking about self-care and I

676
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:55,342
think this goes back to what you
were talking about earlier today,

677
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,282
because a big part of that was
clear communication, too. Right.

678
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:04,507
being able to express your needs
and. And to be able to take time

679
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:08,766
for yourself or do things. And I
think that step is always just

680
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,847
recognizing like, okay, what is
going on with me right now?

681
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,726
Because I think, I don't know, we
just move so quickly that we

682
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:20,797
don't ever think that. I'll be
like laying in bed and then like,

683
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,757
suddenly I'm like, oh, I
understood. I sat at my desk for

684
00:53:24,757 --> 00:53:28,657
a really long time. And I felt
really grumpy. But if I had

685
00:53:28,657 --> 00:53:34,657
gotten up and a walk, I probably
of chilled out and not this way

686
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:34,927
right now.

687
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:42,081
Dan: Yeah. And the, the. I think
it actually ties really well in

688
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,442
with the, um, having like the
happy teams and actually being

689
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:49,342
much more productive. You know,
you, you just, you said when

690
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:52,072
you're feeling chill, you
actually do more work. Right.

691
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:56,811
And. It can seem
counterintuitive, you know, like

692
00:53:56,811 --> 00:54:00,081
if you think, oh, you know, if,
if I force myself to sit at my

693
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:04,702
desk, you know, and, and, and
bang on whatever I'm working on

694
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:07,222
for hours and hours and hours,
you know, it seems like that's

695
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:09,742
the only way to get things done.
It's done sometimes, you know,

696
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:14,152
but the having healthy, you know,
healthy self and healthy teams,

697
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:17,032
uh, you might be spending time
doing things that aren't like.

698
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:22,262
Writing code or whatever, but it
turns out makes all of you, you

699
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:25,952
know, yourself and then your team
much more productive, ultimately,

700
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:29,911
which the, like, I think studies
have shown us to be obviously

701
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:34,411
very true too, but it's, uh, it
can be hard to, um, or it can be

702
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:39,152
easy to lose sight of, of that. I
think when you're in the, I don't

703
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,731
know, in the thick of it, you
know, so I think that's really, I

704
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:45,061
think, uh, keeping a chill is
it's very good advice.

705
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:45,476
Aurelie: Yeah.

706
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:48,717
Bekah: Well, Aurelie it's been
great to have you here with us.

707
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:51,056
Um, we really appreciate you
talking about this, cause this is

708
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:54,927
something, um, everybody is
dealing with now, uh, before we

709
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:58,797
wrap up, is one piece of advice
that you would give somebody

710
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,657
who's starting a remote job?

711
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:08,385
Aurelie: Um, yeah. having a
journal like every day, Taking

712
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:14,686
notes, and sometimes revisit your
notes like maybe a week later,

713
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:18,878
two weeks later. and not
everything because you might not

714
00:55:18,938 --> 00:55:24,969
know what, why you are not in
that, but, um, some point you

715
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:29,858
will discover that it's probably
a good context for something. And

716
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:34,898
yeah, it's something that worked
well for me. Uh, sometimes it was

717
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:39,159
like, okay. I w I need to take
that. I don't know why, but, and

718
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,568
it just, yeah, well, yeah, I
remember that from that day and I

719
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:46,478
noted that, oh yeah, that's the
piece of information that I need.

720
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:54,559
So yeah. I think the journal
helps and, um, that's it.

721
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:58,103
Dan: I love that. I think that's
great advice. It sounds, it

722
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,384
sounds really cool. It sounds
like a very good idea too, for

723
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:02,664
somebody new joining the team.

724
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:04,487
Bekah: All right. Well, thanks so
much Aurelie

725
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:05,811
