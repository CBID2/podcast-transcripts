00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,190
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season two, Episode

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,230
Two of the Virtual Coffee
podcast.

3
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,079
I'm Bekah, and this is a podcast
that features members of Virtual

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,309
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee
is an intimate group of

5
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,640
developers at all stages of
their coding journey. And

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,070
they're here on this podcast
sharing their stories and what

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,369
they've learned. And we're here
to share it with you. Here with

8
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,679
me today is my co host, Dan.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,609
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. In this
episode of the podcast, we

10
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,670
talked with Lucia Cerchie, a
software engineer mom and

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,090
Arizona transplant. We talked
about the importance of having a

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,840
growth mindset asking questions
and pair programming. And we

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
also talked about the power of
community and feeling

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,450
comfortable asking questions and
asking for help. It was a great

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,989
conversation as always with
Lucia, and I know you're going

16
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,500
to enjoy it.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

18
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:12,069
like we start every Virtual
Coffee, we introduce ourselves

19
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:16,239
with our name, where we're from
what we do, and a random check

20
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,250
in question. Today's question
is, if you could write a book,

21
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,844
what genre would you write it
in? We hope you enjoy this

22
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:26,199
episode.

23
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,700
Hey, I'm Bekah, I am from a
small town in Ohio. I'm a front

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,000
end developer. And if I were to
write a book, I've written one

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,640
nonfiction, so I would not do it
again. in that genre. I would do

26
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,219
thriller, I would write a
thriller, I think, oh, super

27
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:58,730
thriller.

28
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,739
Dan Ott: A superhero thriller.
Nice.

29
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:00,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yes.

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:08,150
Dan Ott: Cross genre. Hi, I'm
Dan, front end developer

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:11,659
from Lakewood, Ohio. And if I
could write a book, I have not

32
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:16,639
written any books. So I don't
have any past experience.

33
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:19,490
nonfiction. So you know, I think
I would go fantasy, but I feel

34
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,349
like with fantasy and thriller,
you really have to make sure

35
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,250
you've connected all the dots,
you know, and everything. So

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:28,430
which could be fun, but also is
a lot of work. But I feel like I

37
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,699
could push through it. It'd be
cool.

38
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,169
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Fun to map
it out.

39
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,389
Dan Ott: Yeah. Alright, fantasy.
That's my answer.

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,409
Lucia Cerchie: Hey, I'm Lucia. I
am a software engineer from

41
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:42,620
sunny, Sunny Arizona. And if I
had to write a book, it would

42
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,340
definitely be fiction, and
probably in the sci fi realm,

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,849
because I've been reading a lot
of it recently. So yeah.

44
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,909
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Very cool.
Any good recommendations.

45
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,110
Lucia Cerchie: Um, I have been
reading a lot of the like, best

46
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,699
sci fi of this or that year
collections, like short stories,

47
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,849
and I really liked 2017. That
was a good year, and sci fi

48
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,050
short stories, apparently.

49
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,729
Dan Ott: Nice.

50
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,020
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Cool. So
welcome to the podcast. It's

51
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:20,750
so good to have you here. It's
always nice to see you in

52
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,870
Virtual Coffee. And I know
that's changed a little bit

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:29,419
since you've taken a new job. So
it's good to to see you today.

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:35,569
And I always like to get started
with your origin story. So how

55
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:36,229
did you come to tech and where
you are right now?

56
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,849
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, I was a
teacher for four years and

57
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,759
transitioned into digital
marketing for some software as a

58
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,419
service startups. And I saw what
the software engineers were

59
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:51,620
doing there. And I liked it. So
I started coding last year.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,009
Cool. And did you do a boot camp
or self taught? How did you kind

61
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,770
of make that transition? Yeah, I
did a self paced boot camp,

62
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,819
which really worked well for me
because I'm also a mom. And I

63
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,699
also enjoyed doing things
outside the boot camp, like

64
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,479
blogging my journey, and
networking with Virtual Coffee

65
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,139
and those types of things. It
was, it was it felt like a

66
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,689
really good choice for me, and
it's worked out well. So

67
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,560
Dan Ott: that's awesome.

68
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,310
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, nice
as a self paced for me, too. And

69
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,779
it was pretty much the only
option for me as a mom, because

70
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,189
there there was no way that I
can just set aside that time for

71
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,220
an intense boot camp. That was
all day or whatever.

72
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,230
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, I feel I
learned better too doing, you

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,339
know, eight hours versus 12
hours a day I think is healthier

74
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:43,730
pace.

75
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,259
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Right. It's
so intense. And I think that

76
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,610
trying to balance mental health
and motherhood and career

77
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,329
changing. That's all that's a
lot of stuff to do. And if you

78
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,500
don't have any time and you're
super exhausted from doing that

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,500
all day, it just leaks into your
life in a lot of ways that are

80
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,730
usually not good.

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,129
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, I got to
get that rest time in.

82
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,060
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so
you're an early career

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,730
developer, and you are a fairly
new mom. And so you've kind of

84
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,319
made a lot of transitions in the
last couple of years. So can you

85
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,589
kind of talk through what those
transitions were like for you

86
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,930
and how you navigated the
challenges?

87
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,730
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, yeah, they
were all pretty much happening

88
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,670
over one year, which is also you
know, the year that we've had

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,639
this pandemic going on. So there
was a lot of changes. Not all of

90
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,300
them welcome, because all the
things that happened because of

91
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,660
Coronavirus, but a lot of them
were very welcome, like the

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,620
birth of my daughter and the
discovery of my passion for

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,310
coding. And it's felt a little
bit like, like me, and my

94
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,129
daughter and my computer are a
little bit it's almost like an

95
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,889
ice floe. And like, anytime I
look up, it's like, oh, the

96
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,310
environments completely changed,
right? But we've got, I've got

97
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,180
these core things that are
anchoring me like my family. And

98
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,709
you know that my daily practice
of coding really helped me get

99
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,519
through the past years, it was
very helpful to have some things

100
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,529
that stayed the same, like
getting up every morning at the

101
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,360
same time. And, you know, still
having my family and my house

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,899
with me every single day like
that. Sometimes, you know, when

103
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,300
you're in the same house, the
same people, everybody knows now

104
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,959
that that can, can become a
strain, but it's also something

105
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,680
that you can really rely on, it
becomes a strength as well.

106
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:48,230
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Right. I
love that. And so, I think, too,

107
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,600
there are a lot of parallels
between being a mom and being a

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,800
new mom, and the growth that you
experience and also like, career

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,720
changing, too, right? There's
these moments that can be really

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,600
great and powerful. And then
there are some that are so

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,480
challenging that like, Am I
going to make it through this

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,769
problem? I don't know if you had
anything like that? Or if if

113
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,810
there's any advice you want to
share to moms out there

114
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,639
listening as they're going
through this too?

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,420
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, yeah, moms
and and bootcamp students,

116
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,209
something that I tell every
bootcamp student is because I

117
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,790
came across my first really long
bug. And I thought was helpful

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,250
for me, too, is to remember what
I used to teach my students

119
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,769
about the growth mindset, which
is like, just because you don't

120
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,389
know something, now we're just
dealing with something that

121
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,740
doesn't mean you can't do it,
right. And when the first time I

122
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,589
hit like a three day bug, I was
like, Oh, my gosh, was I cut out

123
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:46,370
to do this? You really start to
start questioning yourself when

124
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,279
you're in your first big
challenges. But, I remember the

125
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,500
thing that I used to teach my
own students about the growth

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,540
mindset, I was like, Oh, I
understand why this was so hard

127
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,230
for them now, because it's hard
for me, but I have to like, I

128
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,790
think what I did was like, write
down what I was feeling about

129
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,430
it, and then write down, you
know, what the truth about the

130
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,250
situation was, which was that I
was learning about how to debug

131
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,250
things, and that it was going to
be fine. And you know, in a few

132
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,689
weeks, I'd have my website out
there. And that, that helped me

133
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:23,029
kind of externalize that growth
mindset. A lot better, was super

134
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,050
helpful, but it's also totally
normal to, you know, get the

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,990
first time the first huge
challenge and coding and feel

136
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,169
that feeling of like, Oh, no,
and am I cut out for this? You

137
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,549
know, it's something that I
think everybody may feel,

138
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,730
unless, you know, they're
completely bathed in that growth

139
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,870
mindset from early childhood,
which not everybody is. But

140
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,539
everybody may feel at one point
or another when they're on this

141
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:47,960
journey.

142
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,399
Dan Ott: I love that. Like
the...and i feel like that's

143
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,129
true, not just with career
change, you know, any big

144
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,210
transition or, you know, any,
any new thing you're trying to

145
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,059
get into, it's, there's
always...I don't know about

146
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,759
always, but it's a very common
thing, right to run into some

147
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,990
huge thing and and the "Am I cut
out for this" question is, I

148
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,629
don't know it's very real and
hard to sometimes get get

149
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:13,639
through you know, and and it'll
it'll interfere with actually

150
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,710
solving the problem or whatever
it is, you know, to fix that

151
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,289
Lucia Cerchie: That happens with
parenthood too, right? Like, I

152
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:24,620
look at my kid and like, Oh,
that's, that's my child. Whoa,

153
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:29,539
like, and and imposter syndrome
can reroute there too. And that

154
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,950
can make you it's, it can make
you compare yourself to other

155
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,019
parents, you know, in good or
bad ways, things like that. I've

156
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,289
it's less of like, when is my
daughter going to discover that

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,679
I'm not a mom, I'm three owls in
a trench coat and more like, Am

158
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:52,490
I a good parent, you know, I
mean, but at the same time, you

159
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,309
know, just like with coding,
it's like, I've got to where I

160
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:00,409
am now. I'll keep improving.
Your kid is alive. You know,

161
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,590
you're alive, you guys have this
relationship. And that's a

162
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,070
wonderful thing. And there's
there's nothing that can change

163
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,629
the power of that relationship.
So

164
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,370
Dan Ott: that's awesome.
Definitely, I've had plenty of

165
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,549
"am I cut out for this" moments
with the kids over the last

166
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,909
almost five years to have Ben's
about to be five on Sunday. So

167
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,679
well, I can relate anyway.

168
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,039
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I've got an
11 year old and I still

169
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,950
sometimes feel like that. I did
this four times, I still am not

170
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,000
sure whether or not I am any
good at what I'm doing. But I

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,330
think it is, you know, you push
through those moments. And then

172
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,059
you think about those other
moments. And I always try and

173
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:46,399
tell people who are new to
coding to look at how much

174
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:50,870
they've grown. So I haven't made
any progress. But if you look at

175
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,740
where you were last month, or a
year ago, or even yesterday, you

176
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,750
probably have grown, sometimes
it's big leaps. And sometimes

177
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,759
it's tiny steps, but it's still
forward progress. Right. And I

178
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,669
think that it can be hard to
recognize those subtle moments,

179
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,100
but it it's super important.

180
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,610
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, no, it's,
it's, it's so true. And it can

181
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,309
also be helpful to look at your
own children, I think, kind of

182
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,769
in the context of what they're
learning, because childhood is

183
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,950
an incredible time of growth,
and they make just such big

184
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,940
leaps and bounds, you know,
like, looking back on it. Last

185
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,120
year, I remember, like holding
my two and a half month old

186
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,610
daughter and one arm, she
couldn't hold her head up while

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,419
I was like, you know, writing my
first lines of JavaScript with

188
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:44,059
the other arm, and it's like,
oh, we both comes off, like

189
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:49,129
she's almost walking. And here I
am, you know, having dealt with

190
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:53,179
the databases and deployed
things. But I don't even know

191
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,860
how to pull something up in a
local host ,when I started.

192
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,519
Dan Ott: one thing you mentioned
earlier was, like a part of your

193
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,490
process as writing, you know,
like writing things down, like

194
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,590
writing, working, you know,
you're talking about working

195
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,039
through the huge bug or
whatever. And I've always, I've

196
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,860
been, I don't know, I like
noticed and admire, you're like,

197
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,049
just you're sort of...I don't
know what the right word is,

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,299
but...I don't know, you're
writing a lot. And, and I

199
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:28,279
thought that was really cool. I
was wondering if, if you, like,

200
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,429
if you started out with the plan
of, you know, learning and

201
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,519
writing as you learn, or if you
came to it naturally, or if it

202
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,090
was like part of an assignment
for your, you know, for your

203
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,690
boot camper, you know, like, how
did you get yourself to do that

204
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,320
as like, while you're, while
you're learning to code and

205
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,860
everything like that.

206
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,220
Lucia Cerchie: So at first, it
was definitely very intimidating

207
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,809
thinking of blogging, what I was
doing, because it felt like,

208
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,620
just another thing to learn to
do. But I think it was

209
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,009
eventually going to happen
anyway, because I write to

210
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,909
process almost everything in my
life. So learning, writing is

211
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,080
like a natural way for me to
learn something. So I eventually

212
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,710
started doing that just to be
able to process things. Or if I

213
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,960
wanted to learn something,
sometimes I had assigned myself

214
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,860
a blog post, you know, but I
just found that really, really

215
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,500
helpful way of going about it.
And yeah, it's just nice to have

216
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,080
something out there to, to you
also not just to learn

217
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,110
something, but to look at where
you like to have a marker of

218
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,250
where you were right, because
I've learned things I've I've

219
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,539
written blog posts that were
either just like, oh, that was

220
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,259
just the wrong way to think
about it, you know, or, this was

221
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,169
kind of like an older way of
going about approaching solving

222
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,139
this problem. And someone in the
comments brought up a new way to

223
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,710
do it. But that, like it records
that moment in time for me,

224
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,649
which I think is really helpful
just to see, okay, you know,

225
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,799
this is where I've come, this is
where I started. Yeah, just kind

226
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,419
of going with that whole growth
theme.

227
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,230
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And I feel
like you push yourself so much,

228
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,470
or I don't know if this is a
natural thing, or if you work on

229
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,779
getting out of your comfort
zone. But you know, you're

230
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,159
blogging, we did our first round
of lightning talks in November,

231
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,580
and you're they're doing a talk
and you're you're competently

232
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,259
asking questions, which I think
is a really hard thing. And so,

233
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,710
you know, is this been pushing
yourself out of your comfort

234
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,230
zone? Or, you know, how do you
channel that confidence because

235
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,409
I think that is something that
that can be really hard to do.

236
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,769
Lucia Cerchie: I would say a
little bit of it is probably

237
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,419
being an extrovert in a
pandemic. So there's there's a

238
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:47,389
lot of me that wants to get out
there and communicate and all

239
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,080
the ways that I can't find out
which is not in person. So that

240
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,370
includes giving talks and
joining groups and asking

241
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,159
questions. But another part is,
um, something I've been trying

242
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,029
to do over the past year. And
this is this applies to I think,

243
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,889
parenting too, but it's like
your comfort zone is not a place

244
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:12,440
of growth, like it's okay to be
there for a little bit, you

245
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,049
know, if you need to just have
some time to rest, but it's

246
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,399
wherever improvement comes from
kind of like, being completely

247
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,129
out it like not completely
uncomfortable, like there's

248
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,860
psychological safety that always
needs to be there, right, but

249
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,590
but just being like, Oh, this is
new, this is something that I

250
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,490
haven't done before, you know.
And, yeah, it's a little

251
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,149
uncomfortable because of that.
But if I don't keep doing that,

252
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,679
there's no learning happening.

253
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Let's talk
about, I want to kind of move

254
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,740
forward with the conversation
about all this stuff that you're

255
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,279
doing and this idea of
confidence. And, you know, I

256
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,370
want to touch maybe a little bit
more specifically on asking

257
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,370
questions and the experience
that you have with pairing

258
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,639
because I think that that's one
of the things that I missed out

259
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,519
on a lot at boot camp. And along
the way, some people had said,

260
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,889
like, well, you should try
pairing more. But it wasn't

261
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,220
naturally set up. And I didn't
understand the value until I

262
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,700
started working. Because you
learn and you grow so much. But

263
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,480
also it can be a really scary
experience. And I know that,

264
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,690
that a lot of people are
hesitant to do that. So, you

265
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:30,559
know, why? Why did you start
asking people to pair and how

266
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,669
was that experience?

267
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,759
Lucia Cerchie: Well, it was
really, I mean, it was because I

268
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,029
was comfortable in Virtual
Coffee, and provided a safe

269
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,080
environment for me to be like,
Oh, I running into this bug in

270
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,690
this framework I've never worked
with before I know you have,

271
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,950
would you like to pair with me?
Can you navigate me. And that's,

272
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,649
that's been the essence of a lot
of the pair programming. I

273
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:54,860
really like Martin Fowler's
article on it. But it also

274
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,259
doesn't have to fit into any of
those definitions, you know,

275
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:01,340
it's just two people same piece
of code. Another thing I've run

276
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,549
into out there that I think
least some of the intimidation

277
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,740
around pair programming is that
there's like a perception that

278
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,650
you have to like, I don't know,
reach a certain level or a

279
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,009
certain amount of tools to start
doing and it's like, no, like,

280
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:16,039
there's no reason you can't just
pay her on your first few lines

281
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,119
of HTML. You know, there's,
there's absolutely no reason. So

282
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,839
that's another thing that I just
think because it's out there,

283
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,440
that is just a perception that
needs to change.

284
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,009
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's, that's
interesting. Just even the I

285
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,710
came to pairings sort of
organically, mostly through

286
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,519
Virtual Coffee to and hadn't
read any articles. I hadn't read

287
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,640
any of any of that stuff. And so
it never really even occurred to

288
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,130
me to like that people will be
hesitant or whatever about the

289
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,920
actual process, you know,
because I, I guess, I mean,

290
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,410
mostly because I just didn't
know, there was a formal process

291
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,869
to know. But I... you and I have
had some, like really good

292
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:05,150
pairing sessions, too, I found
as a teaching tool, it's like

293
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,539
one of my favorite modes to
write because, because it people

294
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,579
can just kind of like work
together and work through a

295
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:16,549
thing, you know, instead of...as
opposed to somebody asking, oh,

296
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,789
like, trying to copy whatever
the bug is in, you know, from

297
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,430
your console, and like hope
that, you know, like, somebody

298
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,130
can find the, the answer, you
know, like, like, just kind of,

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,799
like, hanging out and going
working through something

300
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,210
together. Always just seems
like, it's just one of my

301
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,420
favorite ways to both learn and
and like and helping, you know,

302
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,990
and teach.

303
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,359
Lucia Cerchie: And it's just,
it's it, like you said, there's

304
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,480
an efficiency aspect to it to
where you're not just going back

305
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,930
and forth. Like with
screenshots, trying to recreate

306
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,480
the environment. It's definitely
I think saves time. But also,

307
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,740
like, builds relationships
between programmers, you know,

308
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,799
and maybe you could say more
about this Dan or Bekah, but

309
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,750
I've heard a lot of a theme I've
heard in Virtual Coffee a lot is

310
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,269
that both navigator and driver
get to learn. It's not just one

311
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:17,660
or the other. That's, that
that's not how it goes. And I

312
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,230
was wondering as, as people who
have navigated a lot, I wonder

313
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,759
what that's been like for you
guys.

314
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,720
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
want to say, you know, I've been

315
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,579
on both sides a lot in the last
year, and I have learned so

316
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:35,420
much. And I do think that you
hit on something, this idea of

317
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,589
psychological safety or feeling
comfortable asking within the

318
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,849
community, because I think that
that just kind of decreases the

319
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,329
feeling of like, I'm taking a
risk here. And like, what is the

320
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:50,180
risk really, if you pair with
someone and you don't know what

321
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,420
you're doing, you just don't
know. Right? And then you have

322
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,269
an opportunity to learn and you
have an opportunity to grow but

323
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:02,420
I know even when I've paired
with people on their projects

324
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,250
when they were asking for help,
I had to look stuff up and ask

325
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,579
questions and just that ability
to have the conversation, the

326
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:15,049
back and forth, we for sure,
we're both growing through that

327
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,829
conversation, whether it's how
we communicate with each other,

328
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,460
or I hadn't thought about it
that way, let's kind of explore

329
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,079
that and walk through, it can be
a really great way to get a

330
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,079
better understanding of
different ways that people

331
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,750
interact with code, how they
think about things, and that

332
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,950
inform your process going
forward. And so I think it's

333
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,980
been, you know, one of my
favorite things of the last year

334
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,529
being able to pair with so many
different people.

335
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,720
Dan Ott: Yeah, I totally agree.
I, the, I mean, it's, you're

336
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,000
always gonna learn things
looking at, like learning about

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,049
how people make, you know, solve
problems and their own way. And

338
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,650
every, every new code base has a
whole bunch of stuff to learn

339
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,630
about, even if it's tech that,
you know, you know, extensively,

340
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,480
you know, there's always stuff
to learn. And the, as I say, the

341
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,750
driver, navigator, like, thing
was never really a formal thing

342
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,130
in my mind, you know, and I know
that it's, it can be helpful for

343
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,680
people to like, sort of navigate
the social structure, but at

344
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,059
least at the beginning, before,
before you've like, worked

345
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,069
together enough to build up a
rapport, you know, but, you

346
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,640
know, it's just such a useful
tool, and you're right, like,

347
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,549
both, like, everybody should be
alert, like, everybody should be

348
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,930
learning all, like, can be
learning all the time. We I've

349
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,430
heard stories of people having,
you know, bad experiences with

350
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,769
pairing, and most of the time,
it's because of usually the

351
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,470
person who is hoping to learn
something, you know, and ask him

352
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,519
for help. And then the other
person, I don't know, just like,

353
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,539
I don't really know what the
right phrase is, but just drives

354
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,049
without any input, you know,
like, you know, like, if we're

355
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,450
gonna use the driver, navigator,
then like, the driver is

356
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,089
driving, but not like actually
asking for navigation, right?

357
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,539
Or, you know, something like
that, right? The just kind of

358
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,450
like powering through something
without actually communicating

359
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,279
and working together. And, and I
feel like that just misses the

360
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,519
point, you know, I'm sure
there's a million YouTube videos

361
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,769
of whatever that problem is, you
know, that somebody could go

362
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,670
watch, like, as a passive
observer, you know, but the, the

363
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,339
pairing, I mean, it's like, it's
in the name, right? It's like,

364
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:37,400
actually a pair, it's not just
teaching or something, or not

365
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,140
just learning, you know, it's,
working together

366
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,680
Lucia Cerchie: yeah, yeah, I
think, like, there's a lot of

367
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,869
strict definitions out there,
right. But I think it can at

368
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,740
least be helpful for the people
in the session to talk to each

369
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,049
other about it, like, just lay
some expectations like this is

370
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,170
how long we're going to do it.
This is what this relationship

371
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,049
is, we're a team on whatever
this is, and we're learning from

372
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,750
each other. You know, it's just
a few things like that before,

373
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,339
before we get started. That way,
you can avoid, hopefully, some

374
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,480
of those experiences.

375
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,630
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: When I did
coding club, pre pandemic, one

376
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,630
of the rules was, you could
never take the keyboard or the

377
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,509
mouse from someone else, right.
And I think that's kind of what

378
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,720
happens in these situations. So
they're not necessarily

379
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,900
physically taking it, especially
if you are remote. But if you

380
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,910
just kind of, don't communicate,
you don't talk through things,

381
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,269
then you're you, you are taking
that away, you're taking away

382
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:35,089
that person's voice, you're
taking away their ability to

383
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,750
play an active role. And both
people, the driver and the

384
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,680
navigator should be taking an
active role in what's happening.

385
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,390
Lucia Cerchie: I like that a
lot. And just thinking about it

386
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,200
more. That seems like a really
great analogy to describe what

387
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,920
happens and could be extended to
I think other situations. In

388
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,140
tech too just it's just a lot to
think about.

389
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,950
Dan Ott: I was just imagining,
physically, like pulling a

390
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,720
keyboard from somebody, you
know, like, I don't know, sorry.

391
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:12,650
There's a scene...

392
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,480
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Even like
Oh, just just give me the

393
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,750
computer and then you know, they
just like move it and start

394
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,900
doing the typing. It's Anyway,
there's a scene.

395
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:27,109
Dan Ott: Oh, yeah, no, no, it
was a NCIS or some one of those

396
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:30,589
shows. And the, the two tech
people like one person was like

397
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,720
typing and trying to solve the
thing. And the other person

398
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,839
said, move over. And instead of
like that person moving over in

399
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,450
the second person typing on the
keyboard, they both just started

400
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,490
typing on the keyboard, just
different sides of the keyboard

401
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,400
at the same time, which well,
it's it's funny, I don't think

402
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,410
very effective pairing method,
but....

403
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,559
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, but I think
it's in a way. The fact that

404
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,769
most parent has moved to zoom
has made us better communicators

405
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,500
because it can get a little bit
frustrating when you're like, no

406
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,009
the the button at the top right
at, Cuz I don't know where I

407
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:04,309
left from, right? And like, oh,
the other right? Sometimes the

408
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,309
days you have to think about the
words that you're using to

409
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:12,140
describe what you mean. And
yeah, there's that there's kind

410
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,210
of a list of little helpful
things you could do, like, go by

411
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,500
line number, not by like, what
the word is, and the function.

412
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:20,869
Things like that.

413
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,779
Dan Ott: Yeah, I think that's, I
think that's good advice. And

414
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,269
like, thinking about that,
there's like a lot of general

415
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,349
things like that, that help. And
if you pair with the same

416
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:34,910
person, you know, enough, like,
I feel like it's two or three,

417
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,970
but you start to learn, you
know, how to navigate, you know,

418
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,940
the way that their brain works,
or whatever, you know, which is

419
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,630
different for everybody. That's
kind of cool, too. Yeah, I mean,

420
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,079
it's just like, with everything,
it's just like, the more you do

421
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,190
it, the more effective effective
it'll be, you know, for yourself

422
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:03,680
and for your team, stuff like
that. Um, so you recently

423
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,809
started a new job, right?

424
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,470
Lucia Cerchie: I did Yeah, it's
at StepZen we're "one API for

425
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,119
all your data", that's the
tagline. And I'm really enjoying

426
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,829
it. It's, it's been great. I am.
It says, a startup and we're all

427
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:23,750
remote. We have a meeting every
day. Stand up meeting every day.

428
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:30,170
At least one. And then yeah, so
I've been it's, it's fun. It's

429
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,869
been fun meeting everybody. But
it's also I think, this is

430
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:35,210
probably experience, a lot of
people are out there about

431
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,569
spending interesting starting a
job without having met anyone at

432
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:44,359
it. You know, be hope to meet
each other someday, but it's,

433
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,549
it's still not going to be
within the next few months. And

434
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:51,799
that's also been something
that's been our point Virtual

435
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,589
Coffee too. I would just love to
fly and see some of you Okay,

436
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:59,630
now, but it's, it's, it's it's
been tough with, but it's also

437
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:06,740
like, opened up some, some doors
like I would, which I think I'm

438
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,519
trying to think here. Yeah,
like, I don't know that I

439
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,630
would've joined Virtual Coffee
if the pandemic hadn't happened.

440
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:21,619
And my, the startup that I'm at
expanded to remote because of

441
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:26,000
it. And that's how, that's why I
was eligible, you know, cuz they

442
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,099
were, I think, California,
specifically beforehand, so,

443
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,569
yeah, yeah.

444
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,740
Dan Ott: Is there I was really
just gonna ask if there's any

445
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,160
pairing going on, you know, at
the new at the new job, or if

446
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,630
that's part of the company at
all?

447
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,549
Lucia Cerchie: I haven't seen it
as part of like, that defined

448
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:54,829
protocol. But I've paired a lot
with people doing that. Yeah,

449
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:59,150
yeah, it's been good. It's been
been fun. It's definitely a

450
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,259
culture where I feel very
comfortable asking questions.

451
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,759
And it's, it's encouraged. So I
have been appreciating that a

452
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,240
lot. feels a little bit like
pairing in Virtual Coffee. So

453
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,099
that's, that's awesome.

454
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:16,880
Dan Ott: What What is, what is
like one way that they made you

455
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,589
comfortable being able to ask
questions?

456
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:22,220
Lucia Cerchie: it was really,
like I've said, so far, it's

457
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,619
been modeling. So I've just seen
everybody from the CEO to like

458
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:31,309
the hybrid just before me, not
that we're like on a flat

459
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,960
structure right now. But they've
all been comfortable, just like

460
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,210
popping the slack and being
like, Hey, I run into this

461
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,740
error, like, anybody know what's
up here. And that has really,

462
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,950
really helped me feel more
comfortable, just come out there

463
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,859
and asking my own questions. And
there have been some, some of my

464
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:57,559
teammates have been very strong
in showing that, like, you know,

465
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,200
they've been in the field for
many more years than I have. And

466
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,140
they're, they're still have
like, a growth mindset. And I

467
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,369
just appreciate that so much.
You know, I think those are, I'm

468
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:11,990
new to the idea of like, what
you call psychological safety

469
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,930
backup, but I've, I've a feeling
that that's part of it, you

470
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,380
know? So, yeah, I'd like to hear
more of like about what you

471
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,029
think is part of that
definition.

472
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,539
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, we're
gonna have an episode coming up

473
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,089
this season, that's going to
talk a lot about psychological

474
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:30,500
safety. And I'm really excited
for that. Because I think, you

475
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,259
know, it's, I think I've heard
that term before, but hadn't

476
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,140
really thought about it that
much until hearing so many

477
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,990
different stories through
Virtual Coffee, and especially

478
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,549
the places that do not create
psychological safety, right,

479
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:51,950
where there's micromanaging
going on and there's constant.

480
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,589
There's a lack of appreciation,
there is a lack of

481
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,009
acknowledgement that you're
making progress. And instead,

482
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:08,390
it's just this, you need to keep
doing these things over and

483
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,470
over. And it doesn't matter how
much you do, because it will

484
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,930
never be enough. And there are
people who will always be right.

485
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,049
And there are people who will
always be wrong, right? Like,

486
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,650
they're just these behaviors
that that are totally

487
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:31,250
unreasonable. And I think I'm
totally miss that you have a

488
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,519
human being in front of you,
right. And so instead of like,

489
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,650
recognizing this is a person,
and I want to support this

490
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:46,789
person, it's like, this is a
being that does work. And I only

491
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:51,980
care about their productivity,
and how much I can control that

492
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,890
more than anything else. Right.
So there's a dehumanization,

493
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,039
that happens in environments
where there's a lack of

494
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,670
psychological safety. And so
when you are in a positive

495
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,839
environment, I think sometimes,
that's when you really recognize

496
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,900
that, oh, wait a minute, maybe
that place didn't allow me to

497
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,089
grow. Because when you're so
caught up in just trying to feel

498
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:19,400
safe, it's very hard to grow.
You're just in protection mode.

499
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,289
Lucia Cerchie: Right? Yeah. Cuz
because you won't. Yeah, you're

500
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,920
gonna be inside your comfort
zone out of defense at that

501
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,380
point, right. Yeah, which is
something I've been very lucky

502
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:38,690
so far, I believe, just with
Virtual Coffee, and at my new

503
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,920
job, just to have been in
environments of safety like

504
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,920
that, but I, like, you know, I'm
trying to think of times where I

505
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,170
was like, I was at a, a
restaurant job as a teenager, or

506
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,720
there was definitely no
psychological safety present

507
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,339
whatsoever. So I'm sure
everybody has had an experience,

508
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,099
and I think talking about it
will help people define those

509
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:09,049
experiences and help them avoid
them in the future. So I think

510
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:12,049
that's going to be a good
episode. I'm looking forward to

511
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:12,289
it.

512
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,869
Dan Ott: Yeah, the the topic of
being feeling comfortable asking

513
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,369
questions, I feel like comes up
a lot in our in virtual coffees,

514
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,380
you know, discussions with, you
know, with newer devs.

515
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,069
I lost my point, I don't really
know... I was just gonna say

516
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,579
like, it's a pretty common,
like, struggle that I think

517
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:39,920
there's somebody who does
struggle with is being able to

518
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,740
feel comfortable asking
questions, or like, you know,

519
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,339
showing that it's okay to ask
questions. And I was just gonna

520
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:51,349
say, it's really cool. That
your, your, your new company at

521
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,049
StepZen, like they, the
modeling, you know, the modeling

522
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,839
that behavior is, I'm pretty
sure how you phrased it. And I

523
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,079
think that's perfect. Like,
that's the way that like, it

524
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,170
seems to me, the best way to, to
do that, right, is to have more

525
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,390
experienced devs model it
because, as we all know, or

526
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,109
should know, at least, at least,
more experienced devs also still

527
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:14,869
have lots of questions all the
time, you know, like, it's just

528
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:18,470
a very natural normal thing. For
a developer. It's just part of

529
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,170
being a developer, right, is not
knowing a thing. And then like,

530
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,420
I don't know, you like work on
it. And then he asks you, you

531
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,670
know, you get stuck and ask
questions. Like, it's just like,

532
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,769
this circle of life

533
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,529
Lucia Cerchie: It's also a part
of being human, right?

534
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:34,549
Dan Ott: Yes. Yes.

535
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:37,700
Lucia Cerchie: And I think it
comes up, I mean, it should come

536
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,519
up probably every professional
field, right, because being

537
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,079
human means to learn. But I
think it comes up a lot in our

538
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:48,079
field, because it changes so
quickly. And that just means

539
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:55,970
you're learning a lot all the
time. And there are, I think,

540
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,230
some perceptions out there in
tech that like, you might just

541
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,869
be born being extremely
authentic and extremely natural

542
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:07,640
coder. It's like that's, I mean,
you know, as really, anybody can

543
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,050
learn how to do it, but you have
to invest the time. And that's,

544
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,710
I think that's important to get
out there, there too. Yeah, or

545
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,010
so.

546
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,530
Dan Ott: Yeah. And I think the
other another piece of that is

547
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,000
that so many people learn on
their own in various ways. Like

548
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,730
both of you, you know, did and I
mean, and I did too, like, it's

549
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,960
you know, you come up you come
at it at your own angle, you

550
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,789
know, and I don't know there's,
there's wait until you work at a

551
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,179
company there's there's or until
you find a community like

552
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,210
Virtual Coffee there's like you
know, your peers or it's hard to

553
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,489
like it's hard to know you know,
how to find the like normalized

554
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,949
behavior for you know, what,
what is normal for a new

555
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:58,019
developer or, and if if most of
what you do is read to it, like

556
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,570
follow Twitter, follow like
people with have like millions

557
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,630
of followers on Twitter or, you
know, blog posts where, who

558
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,289
knows who it is, it can be easy
to get the perception that like,

559
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:10,260
it's important to just know
everything or, you know, the

560
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,719
only successful people like know
everything and don't ever ask

561
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,750
questions, which is just like,
very much not the case, you

562
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,139
know? So

563
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,909
Lucia Cerchie: yeah, yeah. And
that's, that's kind of it makes

564
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,510
me think of parenting too, you
know, it's like, yes. But the

565
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,969
thing about parenting, I think
this is it kind of taught me how

566
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:28,210
to do this, when I started
learning to code, too, is like,

567
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,079
I don't have time to not ask for
help when I need it anymore. I

568
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,440
mean, it's just like, I have it,
I have a daughter, and I'm

569
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,909
responsible for her. And if I
need help, being responsible for

570
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:46,179
her, I am going to ask for that
help right away, you know. And

571
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,349
when it came to coding, like in
college, I used to, like, sit

572
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,440
and struggle over things for
hours and hours and hours before

573
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,400
asking someone to help me with
it, you know. And that, you

574
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,349
know, there is there is
definitely you want to have the

575
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:03,400
experience of your like three
days to a week to who knows how

576
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,099
long working on that one bug,
because everybody's gonna have

577
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,500
that, and it will come up again.
And again, I'm not saying it's

578
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,210
not part of it. But but but
like, when I was doing boot

579
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,960
camp, when I needed to ask for
help, I was gonna go do that. As

580
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,929
soon as I realized it would
become more valuable for me to

581
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,869
learn that from someone else
than for me to keep struggling.

582
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,750
Because there is a balance,
there's like, there's value in

583
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,179
the struggle and learning how to
do things yourself. But there's

584
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,599
also a point where it's like,
okay, the cost benefit analysis

585
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,090
makes it such that I need to go
ask for help right now, you

586
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,539
know, and that's, that's been
something that's been super

587
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:37,989
helpful.

588
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,409
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's a great
point to keep in mind. Right,

589
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,829
especially once you're working
for somebody is, you know,

590
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,369
you're spending their money,
right when you're working. And I

591
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:51,610
forget who was one of our
guests, I don't know if it was,

592
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,769
I guess, or somebody on a
Virtual Coffee, like just one of

593
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:56,800
our talks, but somebody had a
company that worked for had sort

594
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,849
of a sliding scale?

595
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:00,849
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Drew, I
think

596
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,539
Dan Ott: Was it Drew? Yeah. So
we like so they had like a sort

597
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:07,539
of general rule of if you're, if
you're like, stuck, like

598
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:10,929
spinning wheel stuck for x,
like, an hour or something, you

599
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,329
know, that, like, that's when
you should reach out and ask a

600
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,210
question or, you know, something
like that. But then on certain

601
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,550
projects, you know, they would
change the scale, you know, they

602
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,090
all sort of knew what that
meant. And then the the managers

603
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,210
or whoever would, you know,
running a project would say,

604
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,519
Okay, this project is like,
there's a lot of more moving

605
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,769
pieces, or I don't know, it's
higher priority, or something

606
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,170
like that. And so, you know, for
this project, we're going to

607
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,079
bump that up to half an hour and
seven hours, you know, like

608
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,130
that. And I think that was kind
of a cool, it was a cool way to

609
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:47,380
approach it, that  modulating,
like how, how long you take to,

610
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,769
you know, dig into a problem
before you reach out and, you

611
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,630
know, things like that can
change per team per person, and

612
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:58,119
will change over your, of
course, the course of your

613
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,530
career, too. And...I would say
personally, it doesn't get

614
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,079
easier, like trying to figure
that like when that line is, you

615
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,079
know, yeah, it's like, it's not
always easy to figure out.

616
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:12,010
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah. And then if
you're on the more junior side,

617
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,829
and you're asking, sometimes
what's in your head is like, Oh,

618
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:18,190
no, am I gonna waste their time,
but I was recently I realized,

619
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:21,460
you have to flip the tables,
like, you know, you're, you're

620
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,739
on the clock here. You're gonna
save some time by by asking for

621
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,699
help. And again, yeah.

622
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,769
Dan Ott: Yeah. Yeah. And I mean,
you're, like you said, this,

623
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,550
the, the struggle is like
important too. You know, like,

624
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,909
it's like, obviously, you don't
want to just like, it's the

625
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:45,070
second you get stuck, you know,
ask random question, but I don't

626
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,050
know. It's just something to
learn in practice. But it's just

627
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,619
like, the idea of being able to,
like, feel uncomfortable at

628
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,110
being able to ask questions is,
is very important. And it's

629
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,250
something to take art and
practice, as well.

630
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,880
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah. Something I
tell myself, which I always tell

631
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,920
my students is like, what can
they do to take away your

632
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,599
birthday? What are they gonna
do?

633
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,099
Dan Ott: That'd be so sad,

634
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:12,969
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah. Nobody has
the power to do that. So I'm

635
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:14,079
just gonna go and ask a
question.

636
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,380
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
think, you know, Lucia at you

637
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,619
and I both come from teaching
backgrounds. And for me, it was,

638
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:25,429
it almost made it harder to ask
questions, because I had spent

639
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,340
10 years like in front of the
classroom answering questions,

640
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,670
right. And there was an
expectation that I would know

641
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,719
all of the answers to all of the
questions and there's a total

642
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:40,610
different mindset in tech. So it
took me a while to try and

643
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,400
transition from those like learn
habits of you don't ask the

644
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
questions because you're the one
that should be answering them.

645
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,469
But I think you've done a much
better job than I have. But how

646
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,900
has your background I guess, in
teaching kind of informed how

647
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,429
you've approached all of this.

648
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:08,840
Lucia Cerchie: Um, so I was a
literacy coach. And that meant I

649
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,480
was dealing with a lot of
students from very different

650
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,500
backgrounds. And a lot of them
had learning differences.

651
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,239
Because of, I was meeting
students who, usually, we're

652
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,289
falling below the mark for
reading, right. Um, and so I

653
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:34,219
think it gave me a, it made me
more like, understanding of

654
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,940
myself when I was running into a
problem. I was like, okay, like,

655
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,780
you know, you're a new mom, and
it's a pandemic, and have a lot

656
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,250
going on. So maybe like, instead
of, you know, imposing needless

657
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,219
suffering on yourself, go for a
walk and take a break, and then

658
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,710
come back to this later, with a
fresh, fresh brain. And that I

659
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,159
think it's important for
everybody to be like, this kind

660
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,699
of goes back to pairing but for
me to be on the teaching and

661
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:08,900
learning side. Cuz both both
coding and teaching are in my

662
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,829
family, like, I have a lot of
uncles who do those two

663
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:21,380
professions. And my dad went
from here taught for 20 years,

664
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,820
then he went back to get his
PhD. And after he came back from

665
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,989
getting his PhD, he told me
like, I am so gentle with my

666
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:33,320
students now because I
understand the strains that go

667
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,630
on outside of just student life.
Like they're, they're not just a

668
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,900
student right now to me, like
they have everything there pull

669
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,699
people, and going back to school
for him while being a dad helped

670
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:51,260
him understand that. And I
think, again, just having that

671
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,199
perspective with yourself when
you're learning something new is

672
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,630
is really important. Just like,
again, keep going. I can't get

673
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,210
stuck though. Like just take a
break and then come back to it

674
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,789
because there's there's no
reason there's no rule that says

675
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:09,320
you can't just like take 10
minutes to breathe. Yeah, and I

676
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,639
get I get so bad that I
breathing like while coding. Oh

677
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,340
my gosh, sometimes I realize
like, I'm dizzy from going

678
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,559
purple because I like have been
holding my breath while

679
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,579
debugging it's.

680
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,289
Dan Ott: Yeah. All right. Well,
I'm glad that I'm not the only

681
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:25,010
person in the world that...

682
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,838
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I just
really like did that the other

683
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,628
day and then I googled it and
like, it's a it's a thing.

684
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,579
So it's like,
computer...something

685
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,619
Dan Ott: Alright, I'm gonna have
to Google it, because I

686
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,739
definitely do that I like will
be breathing like incredibly

687
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,739
shallowly, just through my nose,
and like I don't, man that's

688
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,579
Lucia Cerchie: I don't know
what's triggering that, I feel

689
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:51,469
like there's a bear chasing me
or

690
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,380
Dan Ott: maybe that's like,
fight or flight or something.

691
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:59,090
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Email
apnea, that's what it's called

692
00:42:59,119 --> 00:42:59,840
Lucia Cerchie: email apnea.

693
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,289
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah.

694
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:00,949
Dan Ott: Oh, my God.

695
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:01,670
Lucia Cerchie: Wow.

696
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,440
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. The
14. Yes. So a former Apple

697
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:09,039
executive coined that term, or
it's credited to her Linda

698
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,809
Stone. But it's it is it's the,
it describes the long periods

699
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:16,150
where you go without breathing
or hold your breath without

700
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,000
realizing it while at your desk
or while at work. I like to do

701
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,460
it all during the day. And I
just noticed it the other day, I

702
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,969
was like, oh, I've been holding
my breath for a while now. When

703
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:29,139
I get into deep thought mode, I
don't know my brain needs to be

704
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,849
reminded that it should be
breathing.

705
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,550
Lucia Cerchie: Because I got so
much going on. I'm not gonna

706
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,570
modulate breathing.

707
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:38,260
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Not
Important.

708
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,250
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, that's why
I like yoga. That's a whole

709
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,179
other thing...

710
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,150
Dan Ott: No, yeah, that I mean,
that kind of stuff. The taking a

711
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,219
walk the breathing. I mean, it's
so important and hard, hard to

712
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:54,699
do without practice. I mean, I
assume it gets better with, with

713
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,099
practice, I couldn't exactly
tell you because I'm still

714
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,039
really bad at it. But it's so
important. It's so useful, like

715
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:04,269
such a useful tool, even to
solving problems, right? I mean,

716
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,510
just like you were saying that
just like, take the walk, you

717
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,500
know, go away from your
computer, and it will be better.

718
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,820
Like, it's like, every time I do
it, it I'm like, why don't I

719
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,650
just do this every time? You
know,

720
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,989
Lucia Cerchie: yeah, haven just
like do a tour, like load the

721
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:23,320
dishwasher. And then like in the
middle of a job like, Oh, I need

722
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,489
to check my environment
variables ... staring at your

723
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:29,710
screen, it sometimes becomes
unproductive.

724
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,670
Dan Ott: Yes, absolutely.

725
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,340
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I listen to
a...oh sorry,

726
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:36,849
Dan Ott: No ahead

727
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,599
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I listened
to a podcast recently where a

728
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,510
neurologist was talking about
that. And that was the first

729
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,389
time when I was like, Oh, yeah,
maybe I should listen to

730
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:50,130
people's advice. But once you
hit a certain age, it's hard to

731
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,150
create, like neuroplasticity or
whatever in your brain. And so

732
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,000
you have to approach it
differently. So as a kid, like

733
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,030
you could keep going through
that and trying and trying and

734
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,980
Trying, and you would learn it
because of, you know, your

735
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,760
ability to create those pathways
as a kid. But like, once you get

736
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:13,230
older, it's harder to do. And
the better tactic he was saying

737
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,230
was, you go until the point of
frustration, and then like,

738
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,289
maybe a little bit more, and
then you take a break, and then

739
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:23,789
you go back to it and keep going
in that pattern. And as adults,

740
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,889
that's how our brain creates
those pathways that we need to

741
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:31,139
learn. And I thought, Okay,
well, that kind of makes sense.

742
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,369
And taking that walk like this
is, this is a strategy for

743
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,530
learning and growing. And so
there's like, the science behind

744
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,130
that, too.

745
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:49,019
Dan Ott: I, my wife, was, I
don't remember exactly where she

746
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:53,579
learned this, but was this
phrase about like, treating

747
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,030
yourself like, this is actually
like, abusive, you know, I mean,

748
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,789
like, not not taking the breaks
like not, you know, like

749
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:02,190
treating this. I mean, it
affected me because it was like,

750
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,349
okay, the way I treat myself
sometimes where I'm like, really

751
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:08,099
deep into something, and it
helps to say just like, imagine

752
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,059
if, instead of yourself, you're
like, forcing some other person

753
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:15,000
to sit at this desk until this
thing is solved, and like,

754
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,110
Lucia Cerchie: And you're not
allowed to breathe,

755
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,360
Dan Ott: Not allowed to breath,
not allowed to go to the

756
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,179
bathroom or whatever, like, you
know, like, you must sit there

757
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,190
and just imagine you're doing
that to somebody else instead of

758
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,139
yourself, you know, and that's
been, like, incredibly

759
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:30,269
instructive to me. Like, and
helpful. Like, I don't know, it

760
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:32,070
was just like, a weird way.
Like, you could kind of like,

761
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,070
imagine, like, you're making
these choices, but like, for

762
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,860
somebody else, and your choices
are going to be probably much

763
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,800
different than, than what you're
forcing yourself to do.

764
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,039
Sometimes, you know, it's like,
you know, I see my kid, like,

765
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,800
whatever I'm like, okay, he
needs a break. Like, let's just,

766
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:48,840
you know, you know, I mean,
like, this is very obvious,

767
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,829
sometimes with a three year old
or four year old. Like, we just

768
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:54,690
need to remove him from the
situation for a little bit, you

769
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,460
know, and I, if it was myself,
you know, I wouldn't, you know,

770
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,429
he just kind of keep like,
banging my head against my

771
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:06,329
keyboard or whatever. And if I
saw somebody doing that, I'd be

772
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,119
like, Hey, go...go take a walk,
you know?

773
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,340
Lucia Cerchie: My daughter makes
a noise, like, ehhhhhh time to

774
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,409
remove her from the situation.
But yeah, it's hard. And she

775
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:23,550
does, she'll do that for like
two minutes straight. But yeah,

776
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,219
it's, it's hard to monitor these
things for yourself, just

777
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,159
because you can't, it's
sometimes it's as simple as you

778
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,099
just can't see yourself, because
your eyes are in your own head.

779
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,869
So. But it's hard to find ways
to be able to monitor yourself.

780
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,190
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We kind of
talked about this in Gant's

781
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:44,909
podcast, Episode Two, where he
was saying, just this idea of

782
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:48,630
knowing your body and the things
that you do, and then kind of

783
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,769
exploring, like, Oh, my body did
this thing. Why did it do that

784
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:57,960
thing? Or what's going on here?
And it's really interesting to

785
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,219
kind of do that monitoring as we
go through these different

786
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,090
problems, right? Because I think
like, you know, I was holding my

787
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,449
breath, or, you know, whatever.
There are certain, like, our

788
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:13,289
body gives us the indications,
but we just keep, we're ignoring

789
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:17,849
the notifications of our body,
right? Like, but approaching

790
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:20,070
that and saying, like, Okay,
look, here's some evidence that

791
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,579
there this thing is about to
happen, or I'm getting a little

792
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:29,969
bit better about like, that was
my anxiety of things like, Oh, I

793
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,110
just felt this way. Now, I know
what comes next here. And this

794
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,369
is the opportunity for me to try
and move in a different

795
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:42,210
direction. And I think that
those things like recognizing

796
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:48,179
those are super important. And,
and that's how we help ourselves

797
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:53,519
to grow to rate by listening to
what our body or whatever is

798
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:54,599
telling us.

799
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,880
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, 100% Yeah,
it's amazing how smart your body

800
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,119
is.

801
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so
you have been going through this

802
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:08,369
journey, right, of a lot of
different things that you've

803
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,969
talked about here. And so what
are some of the most important

804
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:17,190
tools that you think have helped
you to make it through and get

805
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,269
to where you are now?

806
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:21,150
Lucia Cerchie: Oh, man, that's a
that's a big question. I'm

807
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,590
because there's so many things
that said, I've had a supportive

808
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:32,909
family, you know, and supportive
friends. I've I've had a year in

809
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:36,179
digital marketing, which is
really helpful. I think for job

810
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:42,119
searching. I could probably do a
whole nother podcast. But um,

811
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:50,010
I've Yeah, I think the the
family and friends thing is

812
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:55,349
really big too, though, because,
you know, like, my husband and

813
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:59,909
I, we were both working from
home now. And we've been on our

814
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:03,420
computers eight hours a day with
a baby If you know, during the

815
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,380
pandemic, and that's not easy.
So we like constantly been

816
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,889
having conversations about like,
Okay, how are you doing? Do you

817
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:14,579
need any support here? And like
how are you feeling is like

818
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,860
this, you have the baby from
this hour to that hour and a

819
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,619
half or from that or to that or
is working for today, you know.

820
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,170
So during that has been been
really key and so has having

821
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:28,650
Virtual Coffee, because I
started when you can, like go

822
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:36,329
somewhere and meet people. So
most of my friends I've made in

823
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:39,420
tech or online, you know, and
the support I get there's as

824
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,210
online that a lot of that has
come from, from Virtual Coffee

825
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,360
also from like the willingness
to just ping random people who

826
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,730
seem like they know things and
be fun to talk to you on

827
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:51,960
Twitter, that can actually
that's less safe than like

828
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,630
within the community of Virtual
Coffee, obviously. But it's also

829
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,099
had some really good results.
For me, I have enjoyed talking

830
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,599
to some people. And they're
like, there's one guy I made

831
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:05,519
like a recursive tweet. His name
is Oisn Moran. And he was like,

832
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,429
just willing to talk to me for a
half hour about how he worked at

833
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:11,579
the API to like, it was a
retweet of the same tweet. That

834
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:15,329
was the like, it's hard to even
describe it. But he did. It was

835
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:21,780
pretty cool to talk about it.
Yeah, so just just being able

836
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,800
to, I think rely on community is
really important for anybody

837
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,329
just starting this journey out.
Because you can't, I mean,

838
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,760
sometimes it feels like you're
coding on an island, because

839
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,130
you're in your house on your
computer coding, but you're not,

840
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:39,389
you know, and nobody can code on
an island and learn how to do

841
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:41,730
it, especially by themselves. So

842
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,409
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: there's no
Wi Fi on the island....

843
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:54,710
I think that what you just said
about, like, randomly pinging

844
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:00,139
people is been one of the things
that I decided to do this year.

845
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,929
I don't know why, like we you
know, what are you going to

846
00:52:02,929 --> 00:52:06,440
lose? And so then I've been able
to talk to people who have so

847
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,769
much more experienced than I do,
and almost everybody has been

848
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:14,659
really generous with their time.
And in walking me through those

849
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:17,449
things. And I think that, you
know, sometimes that feels

850
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:19,699
risky, but it's not.

851
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,920
Lucia Cerchie: I mean, there's
like a safety thing with like

852
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,309
zoom bombing, you know, but if
you pick someone who was like

853
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,579
public enough on Twitter to be
accountable, then I think that's

854
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:33,139
there's that certain level of,
of safety there. But yeah,

855
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:36,838
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah, for
sure. I am one of the other

856
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:39,148
things that you said that I
really liked is you have this

857
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:42,838
background in digital marketing.
And that's been helpful. And I

858
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:45,929
was talking to a hiring manager
at a pretty large company

859
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:50,188
recently. And one of the things
that he was saying was, you need

860
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:53,878
to people need to approach the
job search, like it's marketing,

861
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:58,768
because you are marketing
yourself. And you found a job. I

862
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:03,539
feel I feel like it was pretty
quickly. And so can you just

863
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:07,168
talk a little bit about how that
how those two kind of work

864
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:07,679
together?

865
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,778
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, um, so I
finished boot camp right before

866
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:17,608
I started this job. And I
hadn't, I was thinking of a job

867
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:19,648
search or something that I was
going to be doing eight hours a

868
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:24,509
day, which is ended up not being
the case, which was nice. So I

869
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:27,329
was what I was doing during boot
camp, it was and it was a long

870
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:31,918
boot camp, too, right. It's
like, nine months, though, is

871
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:36,509
every day I was pinging people
like random people to talk to,

872
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:41,458
just to start building my
community. A was tweeting, I did

873
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,259
the 100 days of code thing on
Twitter that gets you in the

874
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:47,188
habit of sharing what you're
doing pretty consistently, and

875
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:51,719
that was helpful. I was
blogging, I was going to Virtual

876
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,289
Coffee. And if I saw a job that
really made sense for me to

877
00:53:55,289 --> 00:54:01,139
apply to in the sense of that,
like, I either knew the person

878
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:03,778
or they had approached me first,
then I would apply and so that

879
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:09,898
was what my job search was like.
And I had several interviews,

880
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:14,849
too. And that that was that's
what it was, like, I feel like

881
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:18,478
it was like, you know him to
like, Okay, this is I should

882
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:22,438
make a portfolio site because I
can't just have these skills, I

883
00:54:22,438 --> 00:54:26,728
need to communicate them, you
know, and I need to do that in a

884
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:31,018
very online way. And that
there's just a bunch of things

885
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,469
that I habits that I naturally
had from a year in digital

886
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:38,579
marketing, like consistency is
more important than volume when

887
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,349
it comes to like being on
Twitter, for example, or things

888
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:47,068
like I know, just like, this is
a nice color scheme and it's a

889
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:49,228
little bit different from every
other color scheme I've seen out

890
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:51,719
there so I don't use it for my
portfolio website. You know, now

891
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,969
I want to go back and redesign
it so I realized it was not

892
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:57,509
accessible. But you know, like
there there are things like

893
00:54:57,509 --> 00:55:02,789
that, that do that. Do help us
And, you know, I'd love to, you

894
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:05,128
know, maybe do a brown bag on
that for Virtual Coffee people

895
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:10,978
because it's in a way, it's,
it's almost not fair that that's

896
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:13,918
the way it is now, because
sometimes, like, there's a lot

897
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:16,378
of these jobs where you're like,
you aren't doing marketing, as

898
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:20,429
you're coding. That's, that's a
lot of what my job is like right

899
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:25,079
now. But some of them, you'll
just be coding click, you know,

900
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,289
and it's, it's, it's hard,
because you, it feels like you

901
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:32,039
have to learn two jobs in order
to get one, you know, but there

902
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,889
are a few tips, I think that can
really, really help with that.

903
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:39,059
And investing little bits of
time along the way through your

904
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,429
boot camp can be really helpful
and make it a lot easier

905
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:42,358
afterwards, I think,

906
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:50,190
Dan Ott: Do you...like, what
piece of ... aside from actually

907
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:55,980
learning the coding part. Not to
like "aside" that, cuz that's

908
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,059
hard. Everything. Like, what do
you think was the most impactful

909
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:05,369
thing that you did over that,
you know, over that? To help

910
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,190
like to help this process? Like,
was it the blogging? Or was it

911
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,039
you know, like, if you had to
just pick like the top the top

912
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,599
of the list? That's hard. Yeah.
Like what, like, what do you

913
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,050
think the most impactful thing
was, that helped you, you know,

914
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,539
like, find a pretty awesome job.

915
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,420
Lucia Cerchie: I mean, I could
ask the people who hired

916
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:32,730
me...but, but like, as far as
like, getting the all the

917
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,829
interviews that I did get, um, I
think I did not take like this

918
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,260
scattershot approach of like
just applying to literally every

919
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,079
job on LinkedIn. And indeed,
I've heard that has worked for

920
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:46,139
some people, you know, so I'm
not saying, like, the way that I

921
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:48,900
did is the only way but I did
make sure that I had a

922
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,530
connection every time I apply
it, and I, you know, would

923
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,469
mention it in my cover letter.
And so that that was definitely

924
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:03,119
helpful. But I think blogging
about what I did was probably

925
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:06,630
the best, the best thing. And it
was, it can be a little bit

926
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,849
difficult to learn how to do it,
but I had done it in my previous

927
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:16,170
job. So it was a little bit
easier to pick it up. But then

928
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:21,659
again, try to think what I'm
trying to say here, if you've

929
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:23,820
never done it before, you
shouldn't be afraid of it, you

930
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,880
know, like, just pick it up. It
doesn't have to be a fancy

931
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,409
topic. It doesn't have to be
even a new topic, if you're if

932
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:35,039
you're just starting out just
because blogging is new to you.

933
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:37,019
And what you're trying to learn
to do is learn how to blog.

934
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:42,179
Right? So yeah, it's the most
important thing there, I think,

935
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:45,719
is to just get started because
it shows in a way that someone

936
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,219
who's looking at your portfolio
can digest that you've think

937
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:56,760
about, you know, these things
that you're thinking. And if

938
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,750
they've gotten to that point,
then it can maybe even like

939
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:05,219
segue into a conversation later,
which, which has happened a lot

940
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,909
interviews, it's kind of a
natural way to discuss something

941
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:12,719
that you're interested in, which
is, which is always I think, I

942
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,090
think that's a good strategy in
interviews is try to direct the

943
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,010
conversation, something you're
interested in, because you want

944
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:21,300
to, you want to show your
passion. And unless you're

945
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,070
actually interested in it,
you're not going to be able to

946
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,019
show your passion for that it's
not going to naturally come up

947
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:27,750
in your tone of voice and your
face. Right. So

948
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,340
Dan Ott: I think that's great. I
think it's great. I'm glad you

949
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,179
like it. Maybe I led you there.
But I'm glad you said love

950
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,829
blogging, I think that it's
incredibly important for

951
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:45,389
especially for developers who
are hoping to find a job, it's

952
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,869
like one of those things that
will, in my opinion set you far

953
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:54,599
apart more much more than like a
random portfolio side project.

954
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,469
Do you think that isn't? You
know, you know, like, those

955
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:00,809
projects are good for learning
and important to do you know,

956
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,239
but if you're not like reading
about it, like alongside then

957
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,000
it, you know, it doesn't mean
much to somebody who's like

958
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,170
looking at your portfolio site,
like

959
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,300
Lucia Cerchie: Yeah, because
occasionally, unfortunately,

960
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,920
some boot camps really hold your
hand through those or all have

961
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,769
the same type of portfolio
project, you know, so,

962
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,610
Dan Ott: right, absolutely. And
there's no way to really know

963
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,559
what, if any of that is the
case, if as somebody who's just

964
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,480
looking at them, right, but if I
can read about your struggles,

965
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,340
you know, going through it or
what you learned or like,

966
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,750
whatever, however you just like
approaching it, it makes it

967
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,559
makes a huge difference. Plus,
it shows some communication

968
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,699
skills, which like, even if
you're just developing and not

969
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:46,619
doing any marketing,
communication skills remain

970
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,309
very, very, very, very, very
important. and writing skills,

971
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:52,289
you know, I mean, writing is
just part of communication, but

972
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,860
it's, it's, it's, if you can
manage to convince your brain

973
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,090
that it's part of like learning
how to be a good developer. You

974
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:05,130
know, which I think it is, but
yeah, I feel like, you know, for

975
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,769
anybody listening who's on the
fence about it, I feel like it

976
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:09,030
will, it will go a long way.

977
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:11,699
Lucia Cerchie: And it's okay to
not know everything in a blog

978
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:14,849
post, like part of Yeah, I think
almost a main thing and

979
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,849
communication is understanding
what you don't understand.

980
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:22,798
That's, that's always where you
want to start a conversation to

981
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:26,998
if you're not sure, with the
other person, but being able to

982
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,429
define that as is a huge, huge
thing.

983
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:36,809
Dan Ott: Yes. 100% agree. Yep.
Again, we're talking to again,

984
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:40,889
about the exact same thing about
about that, like, starting

985
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:43,228
blogging in you know, not
knowing everything and like,

986
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:46,768
that it can actually be a
virtue, you know, like, you

987
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,248
know, and help your, you know,
people reading trust you more if

988
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:54,449
you are sort of honest about
what you don't know, you know,

989
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:56,670
Lucia Cerchie: that kind of goes
into ask him for help to just

990
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,789
it's okay to be vulnerable
without being apologetic, you

991
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,059
know?

992
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:00,809
Dan Ott: Yes, it is.

993
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:03,239
Lucia Cerchie: It is not your
fault that you don't know.

994
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:08,369
Right. But you can admit that
you don't. And that's that's,

995
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,659
that's fine.

996
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:11,880
Dan Ott: Absolutely.

997
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,420
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
think that's such great advice,

998
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,440
and you hit on so many important
things in this episode. I really

999
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,730
love that idea of it's about
consistency, more than volume, I

1000
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,739
think that you said and the idea
of like, being open and being

1001
01:01:28,739 --> 01:01:32,280
out there and communicating. So
thank you so much for talking
