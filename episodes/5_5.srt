Dan: Hey Bekah. Today we're
talking with Roger Gentry. Roger

00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:44,174
problems and his process for
finding solutions. He shares some

13
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,725
tips for working through
frustrations and how to ask for

14
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:47,115
help.

15
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,975
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

16
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,975
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

17
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:56,725
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

18
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:08,802
you enjoy this episode. Today's
random check-in question is if

19
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:13,783
you could be an article of
clothing, what would it be? My

20
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,983
name is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

21
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:22,813
town in Ohio. And if I could be
any article clothing, it'd

22
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:27,313
probably be a sweatshirt like a
hoodie. Um, because I have a

23
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:30,822
collection of them since the
pandemic started, I just keep

24
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,112
buying them. I can't stop.
They're very comfortable and I

25
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:38,472
like them. So I'll go with
hoodie.

26
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:44,367
Dan: Yeah, hoodies are good, um,
hi, I'm Dan. I am a web developer

27
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:49,528
from Cleveland, Ohio, and yeah,
if I could be an article of

28
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:54,567
clothing. I mean, hoodie was like
up there. I think, um, I think

29
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,188
I'm going to go with like a rain
shell. So like a rank. Yeah.

30
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:02,688
Raincoat. So I say shell, cause
it's like, that's, that's what

31
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,647
you call it when it's camping.
Right. So shell is something that

32
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:07,528
can go. Yeah. Yeah. People who,
people who know, who know, and,

33
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,018
and if you don't know them,
that's fine too. But, uh, it's

34
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:12,298
like it's called a shell because
you can put it on top of, you

35
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,068
know, if you have a hoodie or
whatever, you can still wear it.

36
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:16,018
You know, your rain color, it
keeps you protected, but you can

37
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,087
wear it in summer and stuff too.
But raincoat.

38
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,043
Bekah: It goes over your rain
coat.

39
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,312
Dan: No, no, no, it's a raincoat,
but like not like a fancy

40
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,402
raincoat that looks nice. It's
like a raincoat that is, you

41
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:30,312
know, a utility, you call it a
shell because you can put it

42
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,703
over, you know, you can like
bring the same raincoat camping

43
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:36,103
in the summer and the winter and
whatever, you know. So in the

44
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:39,103
winter, I just put it over top of
all my layers and summer put over

45
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:42,823
top of the t-shirt or whatever.
That's why he called it shell.

46
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,513
Bekah: I would like it to look
like a turtle show. shell.

47
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,228
Dan: Okay, well, you can have the
turtle shell rain, Rachel, and

48
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:52,798
that'd be fine too.

49
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,568
Roger: Hi everyone. My name's
Roger, and I'm a full stack

50
00:02:56,807 --> 00:03:00,888
developer and sunny Southern
California. And if I was an

51
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,578
article of clothing, I'd have to
be a zip-up hoodie, specifically,

52
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,997
a zip-up hoodie, because
everything else just sort of a,

53
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:11,987
you get caught in the, in the web
of the sweater, the zip up, you

54
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:15,677
can just go quickly from hot to
cold. And, you know, I love that.

55
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:21,651
Bekah: Yeah, I, like the zip-up
hoodie too. It just depends on my

56
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:25,072
mood, but also like sometimes
it's hot and sometimes it's cold

57
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,322
and it's much easier to remove
one that has a zipper

58
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:31,025
Dan: yeah. I mean, zip-up buddies
are clearly better than pull over

59
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:31,324
something.

60
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,900
Bekah: Not all the time. I mean,
zippers are cold too. So if it's

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,483
cold outside and they touch your
skin, then it's cold Roger.

62
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:44,532
Thanks for being here. Very glad
to have you on the podcast. And

63
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:48,582
when we start the podcast,
everyone, we like to get people's

64
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:52,453
origin stories. So how, what
brought you to where you are

65
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:54,073
today in life?

66
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,842
Roger: You know, it's kind of
funny. I kind of remember the

67
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:02,443
first time that I saw somebody
building a website and it was

68
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,432
some friends of mine in the
school library and, uh, they.

69
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:12,508
Just we're having fun. And I
wanted to do that as well. So I

70
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:17,307
kind of acquired a free computer
and, uh, just set that up in my

71
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,848
room. Like, you know, this is, I
can't even remember the year

72
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:24,608
early, two thousands. So, you
know, it wasn't that, uh, I

73
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,747
advanced to have a laptop quite
yet for me. And once I kind of

74
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:33,278
figured out how I could build a
website with HTML and CSS and

75
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:39,937
notepad on the windows, I kind of
was hooked. And it just sort of

76
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:44,017
became a, almost like a hobby
that just kept me going all the

77
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:50,637
time. And. I took that skill set
and immediately did the thing

78
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,968
that I've done kind of forever
now is turned it into a way to

79
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:59,098
make money, which I did by going
to just the businesses that were

80
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,067
in my town and finding the one
that just had a terrible website

81
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,197
and convincing them that they
needed a new one and I could be

82
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:09,543
the person to build it. Um, kind
of. As I went along in school and

83
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,242
eventually high school, I had an
opportunity to take kind of a, a

84
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:15,843
multimedia course, which taught
me a lot of like Photoshop

85
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:21,423
illustrator, just a lot of, uh,
photo editing and video editing

86
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:25,773
skills that I kind of combined
into this, you know, love of code

87
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:30,333
with the web design side of
things. And, you know, that kind

88
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:35,072
of propelled me forward and I've
always had a knack for fixing

89
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:40,242
things. I kind of landed in this
weird place of, uh, fixing a lot

90
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:44,622
more things than I was building,
but then using the skillset of

91
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:49,033
being, you know, a developer at
heart to build a solutions, to

92
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,733
solve problems in ways. People
weren't thinking about, and that

93
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:57,872
excited me more and more, and,
you know, I'm kind of a, a person

94
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:00,872
in necessity. If I, if I see
something that I really need,

95
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,233
I'll figure out a way to get it.
And I wanted to build a SAS

96
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:10,333
product for fun. I, and the kind
of. Managed to make that possible

97
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:14,892
with a company I was working at
and we, we had a lot of fun

98
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:18,132
putting it together, but then I
kind of found, I had a lot more

99
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,252
fun building kind of the
prototype and understanding the

100
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,533
code and coming up with the
methodologies and how we were

101
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:29,382
going to do things and looking
at. Back. I kind of have always

102
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,413
been a, like a web developer, but
it was at that point where I was

103
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:36,552
putting together this weird
little cloud service that I

104
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:41,322
really saw a need to become on
everything developer because you

105
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:45,343
know, there was so much more.
That was missing from what I

106
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:49,273
wanted to put together. And that
led me to, just to kind of absorb

107
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:52,603
into building iOS and Android
applications and then a web

108
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:57,012
backend and, you know, combining
everything together and finding

109
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:01,783
the glue that works the best,
which surprisingly there's no

110
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:04,692
really good fit all solution.
Despite any of the marketing that

111
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:09,057
you'll see on anybody's products.
And. Getting everything together.

112
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:12,807
And finally seeing like an API
that I wrote and connect to the

113
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,038
apps that I helped build with the
website that I put together for a

114
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,637
customer that I sold an idea to.
Like that was the moment that I

115
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:24,418
really kind of found like. The
group that I liked to exist in,

116
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,288
and it's always propelled me to
have ideas and projects that I

117
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:32,158
like working on, but, going back,
I still think of the dorky kid

118
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:36,658
that was sitting in his room,
reading the HTML and CSS for

119
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,387
dummies book that he bought at
the thrift store for 50 cents.

120
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,778
And, you know, that's propelled
me into a lifelong period of not

121
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:47,247
only learning, but also figuring
things out and solving problems

122
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:52,708
in just a different way, because
you know, Come from a place where

123
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,358
I've been building out a
necessity. And if you tell me

124
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,278
that there's a problem, I'll
figure out a way to fix it. The

125
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,278
way to fix it might not be the
best way, it's working.

126
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:06,968
Dan: I love that. I love that.
You're. And, and like, I, I

127
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,798
think, uh, maybe not where you
ended up in your career path, but

128
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:12,199
the beginnings of your career
started off very similar to mine.

129
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,738
Right? Uh, I think I had that
exact same for dummies book that

130
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:20,519
I bought at their store as well.
Um, and, yeah, I mean like the,

131
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,848
the cool thing for me is, is that
like how, how you. Sort of

132
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:29,749
organically followed. Right? What
you, what you found interesting,

133
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,288
what you saw, you know, neat.
Like you saw there was a need for

134
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:38,418
different pieces to different
puzzles, right. And, um, the idea

135
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:44,119
that you don't have to stay in
one lane or, or, or one specialty

136
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,969
or anything like that. Right. I
mean, full stack developers is a

137
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:53,464
pretty common phrase these days,
I think, but, um, I think. I

138
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:56,644
think that my favorite part about
that, the full sec ideas is the

139
00:08:56,644 --> 00:09:01,293
idea that like you have the
power, any person has the power

140
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:04,274
to kind of go and chase down, you
know, something that they want

141
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,203
to, that they find interesting
and want to, and want to build

142
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:07,504
it, want to fix or solve.

143
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,033
Roger: Something that would
happen when I was working as a

144
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:15,604
technician is, you know, I'd come
in and I'd fix a problem. That

145
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:19,624
for the user was really, really
difficult. And I made it seem

146
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:22,923
impossibly easy, and a lot of
them would say, wow, you're a

147
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:27,274
wizard. You fix it like magic.
Right. When you sit in front of,

148
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:32,043
you know, a terminal for the
first time, so to speak and you

149
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,833
run that code and it does the
thing that you told it to, like,

150
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:38,433
it feels like magic. It feels
like you cast a spell and

151
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,178
something cool happened. And, I
feel like that that magic is

152
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,178
captivating for, for a lot of
people. And like, once you, once

153
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:48,749
you see it, once you realize that
you can cast that spell and make

154
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:51,928
that magic happen, like it's
almost an addiction. Like you're

155
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,359
like, well, what other things can
I do? It's like, oh Yeah, this

156
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,239
doorbell is no longer supported.
Let's see if we can, you know,

157
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:00,538
hack it and make it something,
something useful. Again, like

158
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,198
it's just, you find solutions to
problems that, you know, you

159
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:07,438
didn't even know were problems
because now, you know, the magic

160
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,458
behind how it all works.

161
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:12,850
Bekah: Yeah, I love how you talk
so much about the magic and the

162
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,100
problem solving. And I think
that's one of the things that

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,980
interest, so many people about
being in tech and it's

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,100
simultaneously one of the most
frustrating things about being in

165
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,221
tech, right? Like can get hard
and you're stuck on those

166
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:29,306
problems in Um, sometimes it can
be. Feelings of self doubt, like,

167
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:33,206
oh, what kind of program or am I,
I can't figure this out. So how

168
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:37,525
do you approach problem solving
and, and maybe avoid those

169
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,466
feelings? Or do you have tips on
how to avoid those feelings?

170
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:45,946
Roger: You know, so much of what
I've been able to figure out has

171
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,605
been a, let me just change this
line of code refresh and see if

172
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:53,671
it fixes the problem. And. You
know, I come from a background of

173
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,941
fixing a lot of weird problems
that I never had a say in

174
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,390
creating. And so a lot of the
times it was like, okay, this was

175
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,350
doing a thing correctly before,
and this is how we got to there.

176
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,230
Now, when I try to do these
steps, this is what happens.

177
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,260
Well, now I know how to replicate
the problem. And I got to just

178
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,020
work backwards from there and try
to figure out why it's failing in

179
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,500
that step. And okay, well now we
know it's this problem. Let's

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,201
search around and see if we can
figure out if there's a solution

181
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:23,245
for this somewhere that we can
use or. If we just keep having to

182
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:27,176
dig further down. So it's kind of
more of a beat it with a hammer

183
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:30,895
until it shows you like something
that's useful. And then you take

184
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,416
that little spec and it's like,
okay, let's analyze this and go

185
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,446
down a rabbit hole and solve that
problem and then move on to the

186
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,196
next error. And eventually you'll
find kind of the answer. And then

187
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:43,676
once you have like that
experiences to that one problem.

188
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,375
You know, that that networking
piece of equipment in the closet

189
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,846
was actually the faulty, you
know, problem, the whole thing.

190
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:53,566
And it was a bad ethernet cable
that somebody. Broken the door

191
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:57,466
that caused everybody's issues
for the day. And now in the

192
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,895
future, when you're sitting in
there looking at that similar

193
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:02,895
problem, you know, your mind is
thinking about these things as

194
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,926
well, whereas before it may have
taken you hours to get there.

195
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,716
Well, now I know I can overcome
that because I had to do it in a

196
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,956
time of crisis. And I can, if I
can overcome that this little

197
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:15,676
error that I'm dealing with, I'll
figure out eventually. And it's

198
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:19,005
the same thing with programming.
Like I was dealing with like

199
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:24,451
just, uh, Data formats that I
wasn't familiar with. And I

200
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,721
wanted to just sort of see if I
could figure it out. It took a

201
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:30,780
little while, but eventually, you
know, I put enough pieces to the

202
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,650
puzzle together and I got the
answer I needed. And like, it, it

203
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,441
was one of those moments where
it's like, I overcame something

204
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:41,311
that was only existed because the
way that I formatted the first

205
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,160
time wasn't necessarily the
correct way to parse that data.

206
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,005
But then once I figured out the
right way, It worked. And then

207
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:51,395
I'm sitting there being like,
huh. Now how it works instantly.

208
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,076
I was trying to find the next
problem to solve.

209
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:58,147
Dan: Yeah, that, um, dopamine
rush from. Actually solving the

210
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,996
thing. Right. And it's like
greater. I feel like for me, at

211
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,866
least most of the time, anyway,
it's, it's greater. The harder it

212
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:08,527
is, the deeper down the rabbit
hole you go, right. There's

213
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:13,147
sometimes where I get all the way
down and I figured it's taken me

214
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:18,006
so long. That I'm just like, I
just hate this. Like finally, his

215
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,937
bug is squashed, you know, but I
think lots of times I get that, I

216
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:25,547
get that same, um, that same like
spike of, uh, just feels good and

217
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,216
like, okay, let's find out what's
next, you know?

218
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:33,756
Roger: I've had times where I
spent a lot of the night in a

219
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:37,057
networking closet, trying to
solve some weird networking

220
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,417
problem and trying to get
something that was on the network

221
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,716
that was working before I got
there. Wasn't working now to back

222
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:46,836
to that working state and it's
hot and it's terrible and I'm

223
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,927
hungry. And so anytime that I'm
sitting in front of my computer,

224
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:53,282
working on a hard coding problem,
I think. I think back to myself

225
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:56,042
and the networking closet and
remember I'm not there and I

226
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,912
can't eat something and I step
away and is fine because I will

227
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:03,361
figure it out. And it's kind of
like the sense of encouragement

228
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,552
that I tell myself when I'm
dealing with the hard problem.

229
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,922
Just knowing that eventually it
will be solved one way or

230
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:11,731
another. And there's only so much
I can worry about with it right

231
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,211
now. And eventually you just have
to say enough's enough, walk away

232
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,491
and come back to it later. And
then you're like, oh yeah, you

233
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,902
know? what? I don't know why this
is so hard earlier. I was just

234
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:20,432
grumpy.

235
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,351
Dan: I think that's great advice.
And I like, I want to reiterate

236
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,272
that cause that's the, one of the
hardest things to remember, and

237
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:31,282
it's so easy to get stuck in that
like, It's it's so easy. It's

238
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,032
it's like when you're down in
some hole, you know, trying to

239
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,942
figure something out and nothing
makes sense. It's hard to step

240
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:42,142
away. It's at least for me, it's
hard. I hard time stepping away

241
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,761
and, you're right. Roger. Like
every time that I do, it's

242
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,221
helpful. Like it's always helpful
and I'm always like, why didn't I

243
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,241
just do this hour ago? Like, why
didn't I stick go walk around the

244
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,701
building or go get it, you know,
across the street, get a cup of

245
00:14:55,701 --> 00:15:00,412
coffee or something like that.
Every time, not every time, but

246
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:02,871
it happens to me so often, you
know, and it's like, I don't

247
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,481
know, almost physically hard to
get myself to step away. I'm

248
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,192
like, I know I can get this if I
just,

249
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:09,667
Bekah: I always get annoyed when
people are like, just step up,

250
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:12,216
you just need to go for a walk.
I'm like, you just don't need to

251
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:15,006
tell me what to do. Right. And
then like an hour and a half

252
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:18,576
later, I do it. I'm like, oh,
okay. Fine. Like, yes, now I get

253
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:18,667
it.

254
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,407
Roger: I think part of that is,
uh, you know, that there's like

255
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,256
that dopamine rush when you're
going to solve the problem. And

256
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,376
so you're like, I, if I just do
this a little bit longer, it will

257
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:32,797
be solved and I'm going to feel
good about it. so you're, you're

258
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,976
you're so in the middle of like
that frustrating piece where you

259
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,586
just like, you know, the payoff
is going to be so much better

260
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,626
than more frustrated at the
problem that you're going to you

261
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:44,076
are want to finish it. And
stepping away is almost like a

262
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:49,596
sign of defeat into yourself. No
one else cares. But you, but even

263
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:54,517
so like that, that step away is
what you need and yet doing it.

264
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,797
is so frustratingly difficult.

265
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,677
Bekah: Yeah, was working on this
problem last week and I knew that

266
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:06,506
I was close. Right. Like I could
feel it there, something wrong

267
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:11,001
and I, I just needed to spend
more time going over. Line by

268
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,062
line, which I had already done. I
had already done with other

269
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:19,971
people too. And then finally, I,
uh, well then I go into this mode

270
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,692
of all right. I know that one of
these things is wrong. And then I

271
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:28,701
just start like throwing code.
Chaotically does not what you

272
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:36,621
should do because in there I had
the right piece, but then I

273
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:41,272
messed up the other piece that
connected it. so then it still

274
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:46,121
didn't work. And then I was, uh,
debugging it with a coworker. Um,

275
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,812
said, oh yeah, it's this thing.
This is what I expected. It was,

276
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:53,591
you know, you, you forgot to. I
was like, I did have that. I had

277
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:58,481
it at one point I just deleted.
Okay. And so instead I had this

278
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:02,922
mess of a, a code base that
that's not what you want. So like

279
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:10,632
taking, I think that taking that.
Advice of walking away thinking

280
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:14,051
through the problem, rather than
just like throwing all of the

281
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:18,402
things at it is a skill I need to
learn. Maybe.

282
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,876
Roger: The other approach that I
like to the mingled code base is

283
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,057
the burn it all to the ground.
Take what we know is good. And

284
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,426
let's just start over for a
little bit. Cause we learned a

285
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:33,027
lot and throwing all of this
spaghetti against the wall, but

286
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:35,606
yet nothing really stucks, but
we've learned some stuff in the

287
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:38,517
process. going to take what the
good bits that we know go back to

288
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,936
where we know the data is good
and try to do what fit, what we

289
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,721
want. Right. Probably starting
over with a fresh slate is going

290
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:48,781
to give us the answers we need,
because we were not good. When we

291
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,852
were writing that other kids, we
were frustrated.

292
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,076
Dan: Yeah, and I think that's
great advice and it helps sort of

293
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,747
isolate, you know, you can still
add things a bit at a time, you

294
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:01,106
know? So starting from that
fresh, the fresh, like the fresh

295
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:04,396
slate, you know, add things step
by step, you know, and, and you,

296
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:08,396
you very like, you know how you
want it to work. So maybe the

297
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,797
route will be a little bit more
straight forward this way. Right?

298
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:14,527
Cause you have like a plan in
your head. But it'll help you

299
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:18,217
sort of isolate the problem too.
And that's good advice. The

300
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,926
spaghetti on the wall method,
right?

301
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:27,027
Bekah: My favorite method. Um, so
one of the things that we talk a

302
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:31,136
lot about advertorial coffee is
questions, and I think that this

303
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:35,707
kind of goes along with. The
conversation about, you know, how

304
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:39,487
do you ask questions? How do you
ask for help? Like, what is the

305
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,457
right approach to doing that? And
it can be in your code base. It

306
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:45,846
could be when you're interviewing
for a job, but what do you think

307
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:50,616
is a good approach to asking
questions or asking for support

308
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,267
or help finding it?

309
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,576
Roger: Uh, so it kind of, kind of
depends on the problem, right? If

310
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:00,487
you're talking about, you know,
you're sitting on an interview

311
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:05,332
and you want to know if they do
X, Y, or Z, right. You just ask

312
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:09,471
and like, it seems scary at
first, but every company that

313
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,692
I've been in the first interview
with, and I've been like, so what

314
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,751
kind of like hardware stack are
we dealing with? They are always

315
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,362
like, wait, why do you care? Like
you're interviewing for this

316
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,221
role. And it's like, well, no, I
genuinely want to make sure it's

317
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,991
something that I'm gonna be
interested in dealing with

318
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:24,412
before. Like I get excited and we
waste everybody's time and then I

319
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:29,422
get to the job and it's not
exciting. Like. Each time that

320
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:33,291
I've asked like weird difficult
questions or just something that

321
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,561
I was just curious about, it's
always needed a good result in

322
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:40,162
the interview. Like, uh, I
remember in one where I asked

323
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:44,122
the, uh, founder of the company
where he sees himself in the in

324
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:49,041
five years, and that was a, that
was a fun question to see the

325
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,547
last on all of the other managers
where they're just like, But the

326
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:57,176
answer that he gave me was more
about the vision of the company

327
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,416
and where they wanted to take it,
which was really exciting. And so

328
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:04,912
you. Take that same approach when
you're dealing with code, right?

329
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:08,241
If you have a problem, you look
at your message. And I just start

330
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,991
by taking your message copying
and pasting to the search engine

331
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,731
and then say, stack overflow,
give me the great answers to my

332
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:17,781
problem and combining that with
whatever language you're writing

333
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:21,291
it in and what you're trying to
do, typically nets somebody else

334
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,207
on the internet who has the same
problem. And there's probably an

335
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:30,517
XKCD that's relevant to that
exact topic because I've linked

336
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:34,237
to it many times and it's just,
it's kind of that, like, you

337
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,096
know, it? doesn't matter what the
problem you're dealing with.

338
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,376
There, there's an answer out
there somewhere. Somebody knows

339
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:41,707
that answer to the problem you're
dealing with it's just, how do we

340
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,457
get there? And sometimes the
answer is you need to call the

341
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:49,991
vendor or email the person that
wrote it and. It seems terrifying

342
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:53,142
the first dozen times that you
email somebody that wrote some

343
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:58,422
piece of code, it's something
that I've learned about and

344
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:03,432
people that work in technology is
an opportunity to talk about

345
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,642
something nerdy. We're going to
waste as much time as we possibly

346
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,731
can, because it's so rare that we
get somebody who's like excited

347
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:12,402
about the same thing that we're
doing. And then it's a slight.

348
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,852
Okay. Yeah. that took so much
effort to write that email. But

349
00:21:15,852 --> 00:21:17,981
now, like I know this guy and
we're going to totally meet for

350
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,082
drinks when he's at this
conference, because like that's

351
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:23,892
the connection we made. And it's
just about asking the questions

352
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:28,207
and just finding right person
and. Everybody's got an email

353
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:31,896
address on their code, or you can
message them and Twitter, which

354
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:36,307
is still a weird experience just
to be to message random company

355
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,636
being like, Hey, I have this
would you be interested? And next

356
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:43,777
thing you on a meeting to, you
know, meet the person that posted

357
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:47,842
that tweet. That's kind of the
whole power that we have today

358
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:53,092
where we didn't have. like when I
got technology, there was no

359
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,761
Facebook, there was no MySpace.
It seems like a weird time

360
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:59,602
because I'm not that old, but
the, in the age of you know, you,

361
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:04,311
it moves at such a rapid pace
that you are, get dated very

362
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:07,402
quickly if you're not paying
attention. And at that time

363
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:10,821
period, like finding information
was a lot harder, but now it's

364
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,426
just. And

365
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:12,797
Bekah: Yeah.

366
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:17,436
Roger: it depends on how you are
how bad you want that thing. Or

367
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,257
in that answer, if you really,
really want the answer to the

368
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,717
question, you'll find it. It just
might take some time.

369
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:26,557
Bekah: Sorry. I was, I was
thinking I was deep in thought.

370
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:30,007
Dan: I was just reminiscing back
when there was no stack overflow.

371
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,791
Bekah: My kids like to refer to
that as the olden days, we

372
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,192
watched the S the amazing
Spider-Man the one with Andrew

373
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:37,561
Garfield this weekend, and
they're like, oh, we didn't know

374
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:41,102
that you had movies with this
good CGI back in the olden days.

375
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:44,392
It's not even that old!

376
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:46,176
Dan: Kids.

377
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,594
Bekah: Yeah, well, okay. And so I
think that making those

378
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:54,493
connections is so important and
then like asking, asking informed

379
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:58,663
questions too, right. Because
when you're DM-ing someone or

380
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:04,814
emailing someone, you let them
know what you've been working on

381
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:08,144
or how you've been approaching
that thing. Or, you know, one of

382
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:12,433
the things that I like about, um,
our Virtual Coffee repository is

383
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:16,949
we have issue templates. We have
PR templates. Or is that what

384
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:20,159
they're called? Templates forms,
issue forms,

385
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:21,003
Dan: Well,

386
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:26,749
Bekah: templates. How am I saying
it wrong? I wasn't asking

387
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,683
Dan: I don't think that's, I
don't think, I don't think that's

388
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:29,104
a wrong

389
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:30,739
Bekah: if there are called
templates.

390
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:34,304
Dan: Wrong situation, but. I
think that's more of a local

391
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:35,324
dialect situation.

392
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,659
Bekah: It's not what I was
asking.

393
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,403
Dan: Uh,

394
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,098
Bekah: issue.

395
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:51,673
Dan: issue forms. That's what
they're called. They started as

396
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,594
templates and other forms. That's
it? Yeah.

397
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,544
Bekah: one of them is a form,
Right,

398
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,763
Dan: right. right. No, that's
what I mean. That the issue ones.

399
00:23:57,763 --> 00:24:00,614
Yeah, they used to be, we used to
have issue templates and now we

400
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,173
converted them to issue forms.

401
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,898
Roger: And now he just has an
issues everywhere.

402
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:06,854
Dan: Now there's just issues.
Lots of issues.

403
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:12,544
Bekah: Um, but it breaks, it kind
of like breaks down how to ask

404
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,723
questions. And because we work
with so many developers at all

405
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:20,193
stages of the journey, nice to
kind of create a methodical

406
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:25,953
process for question asking, um,
or helping people to go through

407
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:29,749
this process of, is what I see.
This is what I've done. This is

408
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:33,138
what I want to see done, you
know, and providing some evidence

409
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:42,618
for that, because sometimes you
have a random question it feels

410
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,068
exhausting or overwhelming to try
and answer a question. If there's

411
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,699
no context there, right. If you
already have a full slate of work

412
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:56,209
on your desk and somebody asks
you, Hey, have you, I don't, I

413
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,459
don't know. I can't think of a
good example right now, but like,

414
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:05,528
Did I use this thing, right.
Okay. Well walk me through your

415
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,598
coat. Right? And I think that
that's one of those things that

416
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,929
kind of, it's a skill that takes
time to develop that question,

417
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,679
asking ability. And another
reason why I love the coworking

418
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,519
room too, because you have the
time to have those conversations.

419
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,769
And Roger, I know that you've
spent some time in the coworking

420
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,608
room as well.

421
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,909
Roger: Yeah. I, always love just
kind of hanging out in there

422
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,999
cause you never know what kind of
conversations are going to have.

423
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:33,644
And it definitely feels like.
You're at work and these are your

424
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:37,544
coworkers because, you know,
there's, there's a sense of, of

425
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,574
community to it. But at the same
time, you know, like the

426
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,634
conversations, aren't going to
take a weird turn. They're going

427
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:46,723
to typically stay around a
centralized set of topics. And

428
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:51,253
it's comforting to be able to be
just around other people who are

429
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:54,733
programmers and nerds, and just
generally interested in pretty

430
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,344
much the same thing as you are.
And just being like, Hey, I'm

431
00:25:57,344 --> 00:26:00,929
working on this like weird code.
Is there anybody that wants to

432
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,048
jump in and like, give me some
advice on what I'm doing wrong or

433
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,828
how I can make it better. And,
you know, it's kind of exciting

434
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:11,548
just to see the problem solving
that other people go through. And

435
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:14,999
sometimes just the patients that
some people have mentoring

436
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,679
people, it's really amazing and
kind of, you know, uh, lead by

437
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,528
example in some places where you
see these things happen and

438
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:25,199
you're just like, wow, I want to,
I want to improve how I instruct

439
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:28,828
people based off of like what I
just kind of saw. And it's just.

440
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,923
Kind of a cool place just to meet
people from kind of all around

441
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:37,423
the world who just are hanging
out, just wanting to just chill

442
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:40,423
for a few minutes and just talk
about whatever, whatever you're

443
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:43,963
talking about, jumping into the
conversation and jump out. It's

444
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:48,433
really like, uh, been a great
sense of community since, uh, you

445
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:51,104
know, honestly I found Virtual
Coffee when the pandemic kind of

446
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:54,013
was going on and like I dived
into there and I became kind of.

447
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,973
A lot of the close friendships
that I had, because it was just

448
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:02,054
always open and you meet a lot of
really cool, interesting people.

449
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:06,074
And actually my current, my
current job, um, I was actually

450
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:09,884
interviewed, uh, originally in
the coworking room, which led me

451
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:12,554
to being interviewed by the
company, accepting the role with

452
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:15,673
there. So I always think that's
a, that's a fun little story

453
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:18,044
with, uh, Virtual Coffee,
because, you know, there's so

454
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:22,693
many of these people that joined
looking for a job and. Or hoping

455
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:26,324
to find something, but sometimes
you end up finding something in

456
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:28,483
the same room, but you're just
hanging out. And then for fun

457
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,183
sharing, just some project that
you had an idea about or

458
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,203
passionate about. So.

459
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:37,784
Bekah: I love that. That's such a
fun story. Um, okay. So.

460
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:47,868
navigating through like enjoying
that that aspect of coding. So

461
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:54,378
what is the, um, maybe strangest
or most complicated that you've

462
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:54,888
had navigate?

463
00:27:56,098 --> 00:28:00,239
Roger: So I think this goes back
to the days winning. I was

464
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:04,318
working in a support role at a
managed service provider, which

465
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:07,378
means we ran their whole help
desk. And this is one of my

466
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:10,919
favorite stories to tell because
it's just so weird. So the

467
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,009
customer I was supporting is a
company that does. That paints

468
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:21,128
boats. When I'm talking about
boats, I'm talking about big

469
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,298
ships that are, you know, the
ships that they have at

470
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:29,648
Disneyland type size. And they
have an oven that is the size of

471
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:32,943
a literal warehouse, where they
put these boats. To have the

472
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:36,273
paint cure and all of this data
from all of these temperature

473
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:39,574
sensors from all around that
warehouse get fed into one

474
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:44,163
computer. And what happened is
that aging desktop, which was

475
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,884
running probably windows 98 or
something similar, and some

476
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:53,534
version of. Xcel it died and
suddenly their whole business

477
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:57,403
wasn't able to operate because
the computer that ran the sensors

478
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,523
that gave them the data to
certify all of their work wasn't

479
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:04,663
working. And I remember trying
everything that I could to build

480
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,054
a virtual machine that had that
operating system to fund this

481
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:12,884
thing and just constant problems.
And eventually I solved that

482
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:16,993
problem by getting it stood up
with a new version of windows and

483
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:21,584
everything working inside it.
And, and a version of Excel that

484
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,973
I found on an abandoned ware
website that was like a release

485
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,394
candidate that they didn't put
any product activations in. And

486
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,003
it was the least to the clear
version of Excel that I could

487
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,084
find to. macro that business
relied on to capture this data

488
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:39,403
from the sensor. It was, it was a
lot. We had adapters to serial

489
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,733
cables pulling in this data into
a macro unexcited Excel.

490
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:47,114
eventually this all got ran, ran
into a windows 10 bucks

491
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:51,374
eventually and virtualized and
indefinitely, but it was just

492
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:56,324
the, the amount of sheer is going
on and how are we going to fix?

493
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:01,608
Like to get over the finish line
was just astronomical. And like,

494
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:05,088
I look back and I think to
myself, like, you know, could fix

495
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:08,568
a boat up and none of these other
problems seem that hard, little

496
00:30:08,568 --> 00:30:11,479
figure it out. Like it's the same
thing about being in a network

497
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:17,483
closet. Like. You just like all
of these problems have solutions

498
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,794
you're going to get there.
Eventually. It's just a matter of

499
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:23,693
what ridiculous thing you're
going to need to get it across

500
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:27,233
the finish line in the moment.
And I, I feel like when

501
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:31,769
programming, it's a lot of. More,
a lot more critical thinking and

502
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,679
sometimes you just need more
information and just like,

503
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,409
dealing with the problem with
databases, you can't really

504
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,919
figure out what the heck you're
doing. Stop. And like go look at

505
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,699
some databases. And then you're
like, oh, that's what I was doing

506
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:49,078
at Gronk. And suddenly things
click into place. And you know, I

507
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:52,858
just remember so many times as a
technician where there wasn't

508
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:57,388
documentation or somebody to ask
it was figure it out too. The

509
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,209
that you can because they're a
vendor that built this, uh,

510
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:04,963
system went out of business
before you were born. And that's,

511
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,263
and that's a fun, that's a fun
exist. But the thing that I've

512
00:31:08,263 --> 00:31:10,544
learned the most about
programming and programming

513
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:14,953
languages specifically once you
learn the basics, they all start

514
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,943
to kind of merge together. And if
you know, how an if loop and a

515
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,723
while loop works well, you can
pretty much program like 90% of

516
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:26,338
the crap you need to get the job
done. And that's really what it

517
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,788
takes. Like a few, a few if
statements and you've got most of

518
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,909
the programs that are running,
some of the largest systems are

519
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:38,189
just simple things. And when you
can look at a coding written in

520
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,909
something that some random
developer came up with and you're

521
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:45,239
just able to read through it and
understand it because not because

522
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,769
you understand the language. But
because you understand that a

523
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,378
loop's going to keep going back
through these things and

524
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:54,138
eventually it's going to do this.
So now I'm looking for this

525
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:57,709
problem. can pretty much go down
any rabbit hole and find what

526
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,858
you're looking for. Just as long
as you're just willing to keep

527
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:06,199
It's same thing with the boat of
it. I just kept looking and I

528
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,638
found eventually found a way to
fix it.

529
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,638
Dan: Yeah, I love that. And I,
and I think that, and I feel like

530
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,618
I've said this probably before,
but that's like one of the

531
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:17,338
biggest things that separates
somebody that has more experience

532
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:21,419
from somebody who is more
starting out is not necessarily

533
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:28,439
the knowledge accrued, but more
the sort of confidence. You can

534
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,588
do the thing you like that, like
you can probably solve pretty

535
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:35,969
much anything given enough time,
I suppose. But you know, like,

536
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,898
like you said, like that, if you,
if you have less experience, you

537
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,409
just have less black practice,
uh, reading code and being used

538
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:49,209
to loops and if statements and
stuff, um, Jumping trying to read

539
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,278
some other code in a different
language that you're not used to

540
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,098
is going to seem probably a lot
more daunting, you know, but

541
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:57,729
having done it for a long time,
it's is a sector. That's a

542
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:01,808
practice, you know, the practice
of just like, I mean, it's just,

543
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:04,179
like you said, you know, like I
have solved this huge bug in the

544
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:08,169
past, so I just kind of know that
any other bug that comes up, I'm

545
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,459
going to be fine. Right.

546
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,659
Roger: Or on the, on the other
side of it is like, I know I've

547
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,679
taken down production once. So if
I do it again, I know what to

548
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,959
expect. It's sort of like, I've
been chewed out. Let's just get

549
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,739
chewed out again.

550
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,348
Bekah: You don't feel like
terrifying experience to me?

551
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,548
Dan: Have you done it live on a
Twitch stream though.

552
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:35,653
Roger: There's still time.
There's still time.

553
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,108
Bekah: No. you.

554
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:42,644
Dan: Uh, yeah, that was not my
best moment, but eh, I got

555
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:43,153
through it right.

556
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:49,068
Bekah: You, you did you? I think
I would just, I want to crawl

557
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,628
under the bed and stay there.

558
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,788
Roger: I think this is a good
point to mention how important

559
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:59,138
backups and version control are.
And don't be afraid to commit

560
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,528
that code, even if you're not
quite ready for it. Just having

561
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:05,019
something in there that you can
go back and look at and be like,

562
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,148
that's what I did four and a half
hours ago.

563
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,028
Dan: Yes.

564
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,369
Roger: It's so helpful.

565
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:10,838
Dan: Yes.

566
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,934
Bekah: Even like that project
that I was just talking about, I

567
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:18,704
was talking through it with Kirk
one day. Um, was like, well, you

568
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:23,159
know, have you committed
recently? don't have any

569
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,659
commitments, but just like, you
know, I, wasn't going to be a big

570
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,139
project. I thought that I could
it really quickly and get it

571
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,849
done. And then it was like, oh,

572
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:34,068
Dan: Yeah.

573
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:37,048
Bekah: a mistake. Yeah. That
would have been that for sure

574
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,099
would have been useful.

575
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,509
Dan: Yeah, no, that's very good
advice. See, it's like at the

576
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:43,969
times that I've done it, it's
been, it's been super helpful and

577
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,099
it helps with that. Um, and it
gives you more confidence with

578
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,179
that. Um, the approach of just
kind of trying stuff out, right.

579
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:53,414
Throwing stuff at the problem,
because, you know, That. I mean,

580
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:56,083
it's easy. It's easy to go back.
Right? It's easy to throw things

581
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,873
out. It's easy to go and look at
your history. Um, and you can

582
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:04,364
always by that the commits or the
like, It's kind of quashed them

583
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:08,264
right into, like once you finally
solve it into one commit, you

584
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:11,074
know? Uh, I, I mean, I'll have
commits that are just like, well,

585
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,304
let's try this, try this, try
this, that didn't work, try this,

586
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:15,643
try this, you know? And that's
like, that's not what you want to

587
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:19,963
push up. Uh, ultimately, it's
perfectly fine when you're in

588
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:23,083
your, when you're like, you know,
trying to work your way through,

589
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:26,623
through a problem. Uh, at least
at least I think it's, I don't

590
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,963
know. Other people might disagree
with me, but.

591
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:32,764
Roger: I am definitely afraid to
commit until like the code is

592
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,943
perfect, just because I feel like
so many people are going to be

593
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:39,304
judging me, based off of what
they're saying. Um, but. at the

594
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,114
same time, that causes me to
forget, to commit my changes. And

595
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:47,438
I have a habit of doing that
frequently. The best part about

596
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:51,728
being a developer is you can
always automate solutions to your

597
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:57,128
problems. Uh, of mine has been,
uh, every 15 minutes. Take a get

598
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:59,648
commit, and just go ahead and
just save that with the

599
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:04,918
timestamp. I've written that as a
bash script, because that was the

600
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:08,639
easiest, lowest hanging fruit
that I could Do And it works

601
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:13,079
marvelously. And I've used that
for a number of other projects

602
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,088
where I wrote a whole, a whole
set of scripts that took and used

603
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,599
them as a note, taking
application with an auto-save and

604
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,009
sync functionality by getting
bashed. That just was a few

605
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,813
hours. together because I was
annoyed that I forgot to save

606
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,123
something important into the
thing that I was using as a

607
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,994
notepad. So I'm like, I'm never
going to do this again. And it,

608
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:39,264
you solve a problem and you just
use the tools that were available

609
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:39,893
and

610
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,123
Bekah: Do you have a blog post or
a tutorial on the things that

611
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,954
you've done? Cause that would be
super quarter eight.

612
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:50,208
Roger: I definitely should write
this one up because I think I had

613
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,748
intended to, but then I, again,
got distracted and forgot to

614
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,648
complete it, which I, I, I could
say that a lot about a lot of the

615
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,559
domains that I purchased is about
being like, Hey, this is an idea.

616
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:04,429
Ooh, the domains available. Oh, I
should build this. And then I get

617
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,838
the renewal notice a year later.

618
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:12,009
Bekah: You have a domain with an
emoji in it, right.

619
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:18,784
Roger: So I am actually the proud
owner of the email emoji.fm. And

620
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:23,463
I have been trying to figure out
the best way to create an emoji

621
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:27,603
base, social networking, email
platform around that. That is

622
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:33,079
just purely nothing but emojis,
but, uh, amazingly. It is a

623
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,048
surprisingly difficult to get
emails delivered that contain

624
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:40,099
emojis. So I have been trying to
overcome a lot of, um, fun

625
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:45,108
technical problems getting that
service spun up. But, uh, yeah,

626
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:49,309
that's, that's a lot of
entertainment in itself is just,

627
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,208
uh, Hey, go check out this, uh,
emoji email and or domain. And

628
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,668
you're just like, I didn't even
know emojis could be domains.

629
00:37:56,088 --> 00:38:00,914
Hmm. It causes a lot of things
that you shouldn't be buying two

630
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:02,384
interior, a credit card bill.

631
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:10,304
Bekah: I love that. I always
hearing stories. You tell stories

632
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:13,094
about the things that you're
doing, cause like, They're super

633
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,704
entertaining, but then also you
come out with stuff like that.

634
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:20,414
Like I've bought an emoji domain
that never would have crossed my

635
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:21,884
mind to even try doing.

636
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:25,653
Roger: I don't just have one. I
have a specific one that been

637
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,744
putting together for an
authentication service that is

638
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:33,753
themed about a wizard. And the
link is literally the link emoji

639
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:38,313
with the magic wand because there
they're magic links. And so the

640
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:42,333
whole idea is making a, a single
sign-on magic link service that

641
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:46,264
uses emojis is the links just
because like in the right

642
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:50,548
audience, it's, it's really
entertaining. It's also a lot

643
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:53,759
harder to, to forge those because
you know, how many people are

644
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,469
going to be using emojis and
their thing.

645
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,938
Bekah: Well, Once you, you get,
going to be using it. It's going

646
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:05,699
to be the next big thing. It
won't be something of the olden

647
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:07,139
days. It will be of the new end
days.

648
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:12,478
Roger: Well, the thing that I
love about emojis is. Especially

649
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,059
like in Virtual Coffee is a good
example. We have an international

650
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,268
community of developers that come
together. But the thing that is

651
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:22,199
most universal is the wave emoji.
Like everybody knows what that

652
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,088
means. Everybody can react and
like emojis in themself, almost a

653
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:30,028
universal language. Doesn't
matter which one you speak or

654
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:32,518
read the emojis pretty much being
the same thing.

655
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:36,568
Bekah: Okay. So, so you have, I
was going to ask, one of my like,

656
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:40,697
what is the coolest problem that
you want to solve? And you're,

657
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,257
you're talking about some cool
things. So I don't know if you've

658
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:46,568
already mentioned it, or if
you've got another big idea that

659
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:47,097
you want to share.

660
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:51,648
Roger: I think, I think the one
that when I talk about the, the

661
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:54,858
eyes light up of behind everybody
being like, why I didn't even

662
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:58,907
know that that was like something
that people were thinking And

663
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,538
it's kind one of the things that
I found, like the first love of

664
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:06,197
communities and its surrounds,
uh, zombies actually, which is

665
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:11,293
kind of like what makes everybody
laugh and. And I am building a

666
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:15,222
whole platform that does
essentially a distributed network

667
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:19,693
of servers that cash basically a
copy of like the internet

668
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:23,592
archive, the public domain
knowledge stores them, of a way

669
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:28,052
that makes it accessible. The
idea behind it is this, uh, this

670
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:32,853
whole nonprofit in
self-sufficiency and being

671
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,963
resourceful with just what you
have. And part of it comes from

672
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:42,032
desire just to want to host what
I call zombie con and where you

673
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:46,023
got a junk pile of computers and
a challenge. And you throw a

674
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,603
bunch of nerds that say, okay,
rebuild the internet. And here's

675
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:51,693
what you get to use for it,
because I think when you're

676
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:57,402
building out of necessity,
problems become so much different

677
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:03,402
than when you have the luxury of
both time and resources. And I

678
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,922
feel like something special will
come out of that, that I don't

679
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:10,353
even realize. I just, uh, every
time that I kind of talk about

680
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:13,353
that particular side of things,
like it gets people excited

681
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:17,193
because, you know, there's a
sense in all of us that I feel

682
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:21,362
like you want that dopamine
effect of being like, I did it's

683
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:24,663
solving a problem with your code,
it's fixing a server. Or if it's

684
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:27,302
like just something simple as
patching that drywall and looking

685
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:30,813
back and be like, you can't even
tell. It's that sense of pride

686
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,123
and accomplishment that you get
out of like the work that you do

687
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,813
that drives all of us. And the
thing that I've really wanted to

688
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:39,693
build is the, just the way that
we can share that and like make

689
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:43,023
these things being like, this is
how you patch a drywall and open

690
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:46,023
sourcing those and them available
as many people that are

691
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:50,132
interested in it. And just trying
to figure out ways to make it

692
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,222
accessible and last through the
apocalypse, because I feel like

693
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:55,922
that's the hardest challenge you
could ever possibly think about.

694
00:41:56,402 --> 00:42:01,563
And. Thinking about ways to solve
that, to just make your, I don't

695
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,693
know, it just keeps me up at
night.

696
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,353
Bekah: Yeah. that's really
interesting.

697
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:10,936
Roger: Like our most valuable
resources, our knowledge. And if

698
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:15,077
we have to start over losing our
knowledge base as a humanity

699
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,617
would be the most detrimental
thing. And so the more that we

700
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:21,947
work to figure out a way to not
only maintain that, but also use

701
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:25,277
that data and, and part of what
drives the fun on this is like

702
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:29,476
you can download the entirety of
stack overflow as SQL database.

703
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:34,382
To your computer. And now you
have the entirety of all of the

704
00:42:34,382 --> 00:42:37,981
question and answers that you've
needed to fix your programming at

705
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:42,302
your fingertips. It's only up to
you to figure out how to query

706
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:45,751
that data, to find the answers
you need. And I think like doing

707
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,242
that offline, where you don't
have connection to the internet,

708
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:52,291
like makes you more resourceful
and like you, you solve the

709
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:57,161
problems in a different way. And
I feel like. I feel so excited

710
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,461
when I do it on my own. So I just
like trying to build the

711
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,521
platforms and giving the people
the encouragement and the support

712
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:06,731
to know that like all of this
stuff's possible here. Here's the

713
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:07,481
way to get started.

714
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:09,766
Dan: That's awesome.

715
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:14,177
Roger: Like I said it causes
cause everybody to just go down

716
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,487
that rabbit hole and you start
thinking about these things and

717
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:20,027
you're just like, man, I don't
even know how to store, you know,

718
00:43:20,027 --> 00:43:24,257
flour for longer than a couple of
days. Like, how am I in a store

719
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:27,166
for years? And there are
different problems you have to

720
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:27,766
try to solve.

721
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:28,708
Dan: yeah.

722
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:33,614
Bekah: Yeah, I've I really liked
that idea about things get done

723
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:37,784
differently. If it's out of
necessity, there's a very

724
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:43,483
different approach. And a lot of,
I don't know, I don't know if I

725
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:46,483
want to say like innovation that
comes out of it, but you know,

726
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:51,494
when you have to do something,
you're going to think about it in

727
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:57,284
a different way. And you are
going to change things to make

728
00:43:57,284 --> 00:44:01,903
sure that it gets accomplished.
Uh, that I feel mind, building

729
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:05,353
like a scientific on what that
looks like, you know, like let's

730
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:08,233
make these people do it out of
necessity and then these people

731
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,143
can brainstorm. How that turn
out?

732
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:15,923
Dan: I yeah, but I mean, I think
that's a, it's a really

733
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:19,043
interesting point. And it's one
of the, like, sort of through

734
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,233
lines of the way you've been
talking, you know, especially

735
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,244
about your career and, you know,
the choice you made, right. Is,

736
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,153
is that, is that doing by
necessity? And it's a much

737
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:30,929
different, um, Learning path than
school, like a normal, like a

738
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:33,539
sort of traditional school or
even a bootcamp, right. Where

739
00:44:33,898 --> 00:44:39,329
you're learning, because somebody
told you to learn this thing. Uh,

740
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,268
so maybe somebody that comes out
of, if there was some, I don't

741
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:43,559
know if there is these days,
they're not a front end

742
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,938
development, like actual degree,
these who knows, but you know,

743
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,719
like, uh, somebody who graduated
school with that sort of thing

744
00:44:50,728 --> 00:44:54,344
will. Have a, sort of a, maybe a
different knowledge set than

745
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:57,164
somebody who was working for four
years, right. In, in that field.

746
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:00,253
And there's going to be that they
do know that the other person

747
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:03,853
doesn't and vice versa, you know?
Um, but that necessity, uh,

748
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,583
driving is, is, uh, I don't know,
it's an important, interesting,

749
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,423
interesting thing.

750
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:13,903
Roger: You know. Absolutely. And,
and I started, I started in my

751
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:18,273
whole career before I feel like
boot camps were a thing. I tried

752
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:22,923
going to school to learn it. But
by that point I understood more

753
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:26,514
than they were trying to teach
me. And I couldn't, it was, it

754
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:30,784
was, it was a difficult time.
when I realized that can just

755
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:36,298
sort of get the job with. Needing
anything more than being it. Like

756
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,478
that just caused me just to, oh,
I'm going to this. Okay. Yeah, I

757
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:43,498
can do that. And it just, for me,
it's, self-propelled because I

758
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:46,048
always had the tools to figure it
out because that's how I started.

759
00:45:46,048 --> 00:45:49,438
I started, know, not having the
luxury of being able to search

760
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:51,719
the internet for something. Cause
I didn't have the internet to

761
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,648
search. I had HTML and CSS for
dummies. had to find It in that

762
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,009
book and you use that resource.
And so going from that to, to

763
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:04,688
now, And having to be able to
figure things out, out of

764
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:07,748
necessity, because there are
people that couldn't work because

765
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:10,659
their technology wasn't working
and you're responsible to fix it,

766
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,498
being like, okay, now we have
these massive sets of problems.

767
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:18,458
How can we resolve all of them
with automation or how can we

768
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:22,858
solve an unknown problem or build
new problems with And that's,

769
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:27,193
that's kind of exciting because
like, for me, I never learned the

770
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:30,344
fundamentals like you would in
school. And I there's great

771
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:34,063
benefit to going through because
like people learn different ways.

772
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:38,324
And I feel like I had an
understanding from what I learned

773
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:42,494
on how. How all the programming
language kind of overlapped, but

774
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:44,983
when you're in school or you go
through bootcamp, you learn those

775
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:47,983
same things. You get that same
sense of encouragement that, you

776
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:51,434
know, I had to go through and
overcome kind of in the life,

777
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:55,454
life field, there were real
consequences. If things didn't

778
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:59,224
work out. But going through a
traditional or going through a

779
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:02,463
school or a bootcamp, you know,
you get kind of, battle-tested

780
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:05,373
early on because they're shifting
you through all of these ideas

781
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:08,373
and concepts and you learn
fundamentally how all these

782
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:10,983
things work, which gives you
enough confidence to sort of

783
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:14,884
jumpstart where you need to be,
because go from having no idea

784
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:17,853
how any of this technology works
to being like, I know how magic

785
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:22,233
works and I will figure out how
to cast a spell dagnabbit. And,

786
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:23,583
and that in itself has power.

787
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:27,295
Dan: It is power. It's awesome.
It's such a good feeling, whether

788
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:30,244
it doesn't matter how you, I
learn like that, that feeling of,

789
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,635
of knowing how to do the thing,
knowing how to catch the magic

790
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:34,894
spell. I love it.

791
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:38,902
Bekah: That's great. Well, Roger,
just about out of time. So I want

792
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:43,251
to thank you for being here. Is
there any last bits of advice or

793
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,282
things you want our listeners to
hear?

794
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:50,521
Roger: I I never, I didn't think
about this. I should have come

795
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:55,081
prepared. I just think like, if
you're looking at something and

796
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:59,942
you feel out of place or you feel
like you can't do it, or you're

797
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:03,842
not good enough, or what have
you, like feel discouraged

798
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:09,121
because at some point everybody
been that. And has looked through

799
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:13,501
and has gotten over it. And it's
just matter of you getting to it.

800
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:18,032
just have to do it. And then once
you've done it, it's easy. And I

801
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:21,061
try to avoid saying things are
easy because it wasn't easy for

802
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:25,922
me when I started. once I did it,
it became easy. so just

803
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:28,862
remembering, like getting over
that first hurdle and having the

804
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:32,461
confidence of doing the thing,
matter what that thing is.

805
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:35,942
Eventually you're going to do it
doesn't matter how long you wait

806
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:38,942
to do it. You'll get over that
hurdle and it's going to get

807
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:42,961
easier from there because once
you do it, you figured it out.

808
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:46,231
You can't figure it out. It only
goes one direction. It's a

809
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:49,831
one-way street. Once you start
walking, it that's it. You're

810
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:53,161
just going to keep figuring
things out. And when you start,

811
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:56,956
when you start out, I feel like
everything is overwhelming. You

812
00:48:56,956 --> 00:49:00,226
know, there's just a lot of
information coming in. And when

813
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:02,657
you first sit down and you're
falling all of these, you know,

814
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,027
tutorials like, Hey, it works.
But then when you try to do it on

815
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:07,336
your own, it doesn't,
frustrating. Cause you're like, I

816
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:11,056
should be able to have this
thing, do the thing. And it's not

817
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:13,126
that you're ever wrong. It's just
that you have to take a little

818
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:15,467
bit more time to figure out which
step that you missed in the

819
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,706
process because it's somewhere
and when you do it once you can

820
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:22,012
do it again. A dozen times
suddenly they're calling you a

821
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:26,181
senior developer that's just how
it goes. It just takes time and

822
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:28,492
persistence. And eventually
you'll overcome everything.

823
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:33,586
Bekah: Love that as a great way
to end. Thanks so much Roger for

824

825
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:35,411
