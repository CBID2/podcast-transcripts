00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,640
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season two, Episode

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,440
Four of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,679
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,250
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,670
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,490
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,299
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co host, Dan.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,780
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today,
we're joined by Debra-Kaye

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,140
Elliott. Debra-Kaye is a front
end developer going through a

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,630
bootcamp on she's adding a
community learning to her

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,659
learning process. And she's a
career changer from the

12
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,310
administrative field, and has
always wanted to be in tech. And

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,579
we talked about what it's like
to be on the self taught

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,079
developer journey, which I can
tell you is a long one. We

15
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,469
talked about imposter syndrome.
And also some of the key things

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,480
that Debra-Kaye has learned
along the way.

17
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,939
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

18
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,209
like we start every Virtual
Coffee, we introduce ourselves

19
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,019
with our name, where we're from
what we do, and a random check

20
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,010
in question. Today's random
checking question is, if you

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,790
were famous, what would you be
famous for? We hope you enjoy

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:39,540
this episode. Hey, I'm Bekah,
I'm a front end

23
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:46,650
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could be famous

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:51,540
for anything, I think--I like
approach this in two ways, like

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,540
one - like what might be
possible

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,010
or like two - anything? So I
really like the superhero, the

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:03,629
flash, and so I would like to be
famous for being the flash. And,

28
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,659
Dan Ott: like the flash
specifically, or just very, very

29
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,319
fast?

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,599
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I don't
know. I think I think I would

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:19,740
like to be Barry Allen. If but,
if I had to do something that is

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,479
more practical than that, I
would want to be the strongest

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,900
mom in the world. I think I was
telling someone earlier today. I

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,280
like weight lifting, heavy
things. So I will be the

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,370
strongest mom, because that
that's realistic too.

36
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,729
Dan Ott: Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a
front end developer from

37
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:48,990
Lakewood, Ohio. I am not going
practical at all. I my first

38
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,159
instinct was you know, spaceship
flying. So like, like, you know,

39
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,289
the the Millennium Falcon or
whatever, you know, doing the

40
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,960
Kessel Run. I basically like
that'd be my famous you know,

41
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,780
out Dan. Oh, man. He's thinking
he's the fastest you know,

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,830
spaceship flyer there is so
that's that's that's what that's

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,250
my choice,

44
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,479
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: spaceship
flyer?

45
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,270
Dan Ott: --spaceship pilot I
realized flyers are silly way to

46
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,830
say. But, you know, so be it.
That's what it is: Dan, the

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,729
spaceship flyer.

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,479
Debra-Kaye: Hi, I am Debra-Kaye,
front end developer from

49
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:28,250
Jamaica. If I was to be famous
for anything. Um, my first

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,270
answer would be like, fiction
novels, because I am a sucker

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,069
for fiction. And I tend to put a
book down when I start to read

52
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,909
it. And I have a really long
book list of books to read. And

53
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,270
then my second answer would be
I'm so happy to pick a superhero

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,789
because my favorite superheroes
are Captain Marvel and Deadpool.

55
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,199
So like if I could combine their
two powers into one like that

56
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,770
would be because like I'm a
little bit obsessed with

57
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,419
Deadpool. I don't know why I
love Ryan Reynolds. So yeah, so

58
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,729
I have two answers for those
surprisingly so I'm so happy

59
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:08,150
that it's not, like practical
because I always go for

60
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,039
superhero and books first.

61
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,889
Dan Ott: That's sweet. That's
pretty awesome. What are you

62
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:13,789
what are you reading right now?

63
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,759
Debra-Kaye: Um, so I'm reading
its title-- let me, one sec

64
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:27,899
sorry cuz. Yeah, cuz I am almost
halfway, Well, I'm past halfway

65
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:34,500
through the book. And it's by
Estella Vasquez Perez in her

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,459
last name is. And it's a series.
So I'm on the second

67
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:45,300
book. And it's called Dark
Serenade. Yeah, so it's

68
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,990
Montenegro Book Two dark
serenade by Estella Vasquez

69
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,620
Perez.

70
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,110
Dan Ott: Well you're on Book
Two, then you must have like the

71
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,350
first.

72
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,899
Debra-Kaye: Yes, there's three
books so yeah, actually bought

73
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,529
this one because the first one
was free, I know they knew what

74
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,589
to do series first And then see
f you like, it sounds like you

75
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,709
eed to finish series. So two or
three now.

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,540
Dan Ott: That's awesome. Nice.
I've gotten into a bad habit of

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,699
getting the first book of a
series on the library or

78
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,490
whatever. And then just like the
second one isn't available, and

79
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,750
I need it and just buy it, or if
I can find the set, because I'm

80
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,550
just like, Alright, well, I
know, I'm just gonna do this

81
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,449
with the third one or whatever.

82
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,629
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
always make the mistake of

83
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,298
waiting for it to come in from
the library. And then by the

84
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:30,509
time it comes in, I'm like, what
happened in book one?

85
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,389
Debra-Kaye: Like, what I've been
trying to do now is if I see

86
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,658
that the book is a series, after
like, decide, okay, I'm either

87
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:42,629
gonna read through the entire
series before I take up any

88
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,459
other book, or leave that until
like the very end, because if I

89
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,548
started series, I don't want to
be like, okay, read book one,

90
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,579
then start something and then
forgot what happened in that

91
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,309
book, one would have to meet
over so Yeah, totally.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,310
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's a good
strategy. Alright, Debra-Kaye,

93
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,790
we are super happy to have you
here with us today. And we

94
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,839
always like to get started with
what brought a person to this

95
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,019
place in their life. So if you
want to give us the Debra-Kaye

96
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,480
origin story, we would love to
hear it.

97
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:20,399
Debra-Kaye: Oh, I could talk
about this all day. Oh, I'm so

98
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,608
actually studied information
technology. I did my degree in

99
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:28,499
information technology, like
seven years ago, eight years

100
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:33,028
ago. Um, because I always like
to take always like the web--I

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,858
taught myselt to use a computer
when I was like 16. But just

102
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:41,788
didn't really have any sense of
direction and didn't know what

103
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,749
development was, I think so just
didn't really know how to get

104
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:51,959
into the field. So I studied IT,
did a degree and just never got

105
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,019
a job in it. Because that is
wasn't able to when there was no

106
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:01,319
guidance, no anything. And where
I'm from in Jamaica, it's mostly

107
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:06,869
always system admins, network
admins, and I dislike hardware.

108
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,408
I did not like hardware. But
I'll play it with software all

109
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:15,809
day. So I just didn't know what
to do, how to get in it. And it

110
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:20,309
always seemed like programming
was this rocket science thing

111
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:24,778
that only certain people could
do. So I was like, Okay, I don't

112
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,649
know what to do with. So I
discovered I like design too. So

113
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,678
I did like a couple of courses
in graphic design. And then I

114
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:35,579
was like, Okay, I'll go to that.
But then after a year, I was

115
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,108
like, No, I really don't like it
as much. I like it, but not as

116
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:45,629
much as I did. And then in 2019,
I was like, wait, it's time to

117
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,329
be active on Twitter again
because I had an account, but

118
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,088
just didn't do anything with it.
And I kept seeing people talk

119
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,869
about this thing. I was like,
wait, this is a thing. And then

120
00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:01,738
I got the courage to dm somebody
and ask them like, how do you go

121
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,408
about this? What is it, and they
were like, what do you what do

122
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,649
you like? And they're announced,
like saying like, okay, you

123
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,369
could do UX UI. And I was like,
Okay, then I went down that

124
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,338
rabbit hole of research for
months and months and months.

125
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,819
And that's an aside to realize,
like, oh, but development is a

126
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,798
thing. People actually do this.
And it can be done. I don't have

127
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:27,178
to go back to university for it.
Okay, how do I do this? So I

128
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:31,019
went down the rabbit hole and
bookmarked all the courses and

129
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,288
enrolled in lots of things that
I to this day haven't gotten

130
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,948
back to. But when I actually
started to realize that there

131
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:42,958
was actually a way a path to
actually do it. I was like,

132
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,499
Okay, yeah, this is a, this is a
side of things to figure out how

133
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:49,408
to do it. But this is the this
is what I've been searching for.

134
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:53,249
And when I was always I don't
have to know, every single

135
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:59,519
thing. And there are certain
things that you should know. But

136
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,908
then there are other paths in
tech that you really don't need

137
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:07,889
to get into. Like, okay, I can
do this. So I'm probably going

138
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:13,109
to need some some help, but it
can be done. So that's a long

139
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:18,479
winded we have over the course
of several years. Yeah.

140
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,389
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that's so great. And I think

141
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,730
that so many of us, like, I
know, I've been down that rabbit

142
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,529
hole a number of times, right?
And there is so much out there

143
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,950
to try and figure out like what
everybody will say like, Well,

144
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,470
what do you like doing? And
sometimes you don't even know

145
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,620
what you like doing because you
don't know what's available and

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,149
Debra-Kaye: And sometimes it's
more than one thing too.

147
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,230
Dan Ott: Yeah, for sure.

148
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,899
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. And
figuring out how those work

149
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,690
together. I think it's really
great that you dm somebody and

150
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,690
ask for help because I think
that can be a struggle just to

151
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,080
get to that place and to know
that you know you were willing

152
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,470
to put yourself out there is
such a great first step.

153
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,049
Debra-Kaye: Yeah, and funny
thing too when I did that  I DM

154
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,789
is this guy that I have been
following for a while on

155
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:10,350
Twitter, but he is a, I think
he's a Ruby on Rails developer,

156
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,590
if I'm not mistaken. And he has
been doing it for like, over 10

157
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,230
years because he like taught
himself. And he, I sent him this

158
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,169
long message. And I was like,
you know, and he'll never see

159
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,440
this, and he'll never respond.
And he actually responded, I was

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,340
like, Oh, my god. And he's like,
yeah, you can do this, just

161
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,360
like, Look, look into this
avenue, since you like design.

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,659
And I was like, Oh, my god,
somebody responded, and from him

163
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,710
telling me that you can do it.
And he was also self taught, I

164
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,980
was like, Oh, my god, it's
actually a thing. Like, there's

165
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,519
actually some kind of path here,
some kind of Avenue, there's a

166
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,730
way to actually get into this
field, because I always wanted

167
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,740
to be in tech, but I just never
got an opportunity to. And

168
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,529
actually, for someone to
actually who's been doing it for

169
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,720
a while, and encouraging people
to get into tech and tell you

170
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,870
that, hey, it can be done.
There's actually a way they seem

171
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,039
to figure out what works for
you. But it can be done. So that

172
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,970
was really cool.

173
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,259
Dan Ott: I love that. I was
wondering like how he said, find

174
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,250
out which ways work for you. So
what have you found to be the

175
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,669
most like personally useful, you
know, tools to learn other

176
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,090
courses or tutorials? Or, you
know, what kind of what kind of

177
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,500
strategies, or have you been
using?

178
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,379
Debra-Kaye: I have been in--No,
I won't, I won't say another

179
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,159
tutoria hell- I'm not saying
tutorial hell. But I, when I

180
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,149
started, I was enrolling in
every free course that I could

181
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,509
find. Because you know, there's
a treehouse, and there's Udemy.

182
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,649
And there's everything. So I
have like a bookmark folder full

183
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,820
of courses that I could sign up
for. And then I signed up for a

184
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,110
bunch of Udemy courses, never
took them, but like I signed up

185
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,700
for them. And then I bought like
one or two Udemy courses, that

186
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,139
recommended ones. And I still
haven't gotten to those that I

187
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,289
bought yet. And then I started a
Free Code Camp. And then I was

188
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:18,690
doing I'm currently doing front
end masters. And then I was like

189
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,860
10 attorneys do two three at the
same time. And it took me like,

190
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,909
four months to realize that
Okay, one of them is not

191
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:30,779
sticking with information. And
it just wasn't understanding.

192
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,379
And it's like, okay, trying to
juggle too many courses at the

193
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,820
same time. They're all the
basically the fundamentals of

194
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,570
HTML, CSS, I haven't gotten to
JavaScript yet. But I was trying

195
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,120
to like balance. What I was
learning from one boot camp, to

196
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,129
what I was doing with the other
I was like, wait, but they

197
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,889
didn't show me this one in this
boot camp. So this doesn't make

198
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,019
sense. And I had to just decide
like, okay, pick one. Job, the

199
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:04,679
others, try to finish this one,
and then maybe pick up another

200
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,809
one afterwards. So I was, so I
mainly use some front end

201
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:14,190
masters, and of course, YouTube.
And I haven't even gotten to the

202
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,570
Udemy ones yet. But I have like,
one boot camp with me because I

203
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,929
did buy the cold Steel's boot
camp last year, but I still

204
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:28,230
haven't gotten to it yet. So
main sources, front end masters.

205
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,480
Free Code Camp here for some
little things like piece of code

206
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,620
that I know that I honestly
better than and Udemy and

207
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,389
YouTube.  Yeah. Those are the
main ones.

208
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,990
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think it
can be super hard as you're

209
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,360
trying to figure that out, too.
Right? Like you're seeing there

210
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,519
can be conflicting material or
one teaches one approach. And

211
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,990
there's, it just makes it really
hard to kind of learn. But also,

212
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,759
if you can find something that's
good, I was doing a boot camp

213
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,470
before I went to flat iron that
I just dreaded opening up every

214
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,240
morning. Because the material
was just so hard for me. It was

215
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,110
a lot of videos, and I struggle
with videos. And they just kept

216
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,980
trying to make jokes in the
videos. And I was so frustrated

217
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,750
with it. Like just just tell me
what I need to do. And then just

218
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,230
deciding I'm not doing this,
it's not worth it. If it's gonna

219
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,620
make me frustrated and hate what
I'm doing, then I need to find

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,200
something better. And that works
for me. And so I think that

221
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,590
sometimes exactly what you did
is a good path, like look at

222
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,740
these things, and then kind of
figure out what you need to

223
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,399
focus on.

224
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,679
Debra-Kaye: Yeah, and the funny
thing is like I was doing and

225
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,820
granted, granted. Free Code Camp
is a great resource, like that's

226
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,360
the first thing I tell everybody
to go to. And like for the first

227
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,440
like couple sections. I was like
okay, yeah, I understand this,

228
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,179
but I got like, half Through
CSS, and I was like, I don't

229
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,480
know what I'm doing. And it will
say things like, you know,

230
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,169
remember so and so I was like, I
would have to literally go back

231
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,500
to that read the thing again, do
the little exercise again,

232
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,159
because I just wasn't getting
it. And then I kept switching

233
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,889
between that and something else.
And that's important in frontend

234
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,940
masters. I was like, I need to
pick one. And when I started

235
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,539
frontend Masters again, for
like, the third time, I was

236
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,740
like, Oh, wait, this makes
sense. No. And it took me like

237
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,960
partway through to realize that
I wasn't learning inline CSS for

238
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,970
one boot camp, and external CSS
for the other one. And that's

239
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,009
why it wasn't clicking. Because
I despise inline CSS, like, I

240
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,649
just don't read the code. I was
like, I don't know what this is

241
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,919
saying. But it is the external
stylesheet what I can see

242
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,860
everything like, lined up. I was
like, oh, and that's when he

243
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,529
starts to click. And I was like,
okay, yep, jump in this one for

244
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,720
now, because I don't understand
anything here. And let me go do

245
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,570
this one, because I understand
this one better. And I also

246
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,710
like, boot camps or tutorials
where you get like little

247
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,340
exercises to do on your own. And
you actually have to write the

248
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,210
code or to yourself, that you
have to type it from beginning

249
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,720
from your h1, and you have to
like everything on your own,

250
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,919
because it helps us do better
than when a tutorial gives you a

251
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,220
part of the code. And you have
to like change a little one lane

252
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,179
or a little change a color. So
for me, it worked better, where

253
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,830
I had to, like, type everything
out myself, because it helped it

254
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,429
stick out.

255
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,840
Dan Ott: Yeah, I'm the same way
I am. I don't know, I don't ever

256
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,960
remember anything from like
reading or watching videos or

257
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,929
anything like that until I until
I can actually, you know, write

258
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:55,220
it or apply it or whatever.
Whether it's exercise, you know,

259
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,309
at the end of a course, or, you
know, actually trying to do a

260
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,360
project that uses whatever I
learned that kind of thing. For

261
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,900
me, that is always it's always a
way to make it actually stick in

262
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,750
my brain and if I'm going to be
honest, to actually understand

263
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,029
it, you know, I'll sit there not
through a video or a talk or

264
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,109
something, and I won't ever if
somebody asked me a question at

265
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,849
the end, I'd be like, I'm not
really sure. Until I, it's I sit

266
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:22,369
there and use it, you know? And
I'm like, okay, yes, yeah.

267
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,480
Debra-Kaye: Yeah, and one of the
things that I found that work

268
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,230
for me too, is like, shorter
videos, because there are some

269
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,180
tutorials that are like, an hour
long, four hours long, like 20

270
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,710
hours, this and you know, and I,
like I can't, my attention span

271
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,789
is like really short. So like,
with the front end masters

272
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,549
videos, they're all like really
short, like a minute, four

273
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,299
minutes, five minutes. But for
me watching a video is actually

274
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,950
like, the instructor will say
one thing and be like, to do

275
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,950
this, you do this, and I hit
pause, and I'll just start to

276
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,910
try to do it. So for me watching
a video is like me spending two

277
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,880
hours trying to get through one
video, because I will just hit

278
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,670
pause and try to do it, and
rewind and try it again. So a

279
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,829
one hour video for me could
probably take like, I don't

280
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,680
know, five hours because I don't
like to make plays through I

281
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,309
will just, stop trying to do it.
Didn't get that. Okay, and then

282
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,890
play it again. Try to do it.
Yeah.

283
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,930
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that's a really great point.

284
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,190
Like you just said, a one hour
video can take me five hours,

285
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,339
right? Because sometimes when
you're learning something, you

286
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,380
think like, Okay, well, I'm
gonna sit here for an hour, I

287
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,069
have an hour. But that's not
practical application of what

288
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,680
you're learning. And so as
you're going through those

289
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,680
things, actually doing them,
it's going to take more time,

290
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,380
but you're going to learn more
in the long run. And so thinking

291
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,390
about it like that, in terms of
I remember when I was in boot

292
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:01,529
camp, I had maybe complain that
it wasn't clear how long each

293
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,519
lesson was going to take or
exercise. And then somebody

294
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,119
responded, and they said, Well,
you know, part of it is learning

295
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,960
how long it is going to take you
because it will be different for

296
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,349
everyone else. And that was a
lesson that didn't really click

297
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,500
with me until later. But, you
know, depending on where you're

298
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,450
at, and how you approach it, and
how much you've taken and

299
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,809
understood from the previous
lessons, it's going to affect

300
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,079
how long that thing is going to
take you. And don't judge

301
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,099
yourself based on how long it
takes you judge how much

302
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,920
progress you've made and think
about like how much you've

303
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,309
learned through doing that. It's
not it's not a race, right?

304
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,299
Debra-Kaye: And something that
you also realize, too, there are

305
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,420
some things that even though
you've done it to through the

306
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,809
video, so you may you know, stop
and code it. There's some things

307
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,859
that you just can't remember to
do. Or something that you kind

308
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,230
of can't figure out why it's not
working but they didn't Realize

309
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,259
that you didn't do something or
you missed something in the

310
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,539
code. And then there are other
things that you'd have to think

311
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,240
about you just type it because
it's just there in your brain

312
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
and some things just don't
stick.

313
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,868
Dan Ott: Yeah, yeah. And that's,
I mean, that's like part of

314
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:18,298
learning how to code, right? You
know, and trying to do that,

315
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,388
while you're watching a video,
watching it in the middle of an

316
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:27,868
hour long video seems
challenging, the best as egghead

317
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:33,358
has their courses. So it's like
a course on a topic, but it's a

318
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,199
series of, you know, of short
videos, like you're saying, you

319
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,769
know, and so they have like
broken up, you know, built in

320
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,898
pauses. So it's like, one,
you're gonna learn and like a

321
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:46,828
large thing, and it's how, you
know, an hour long, an hour's

322
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,528
worth of content, but you just
see that it's broken up. This is

323
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,409
like, a minute and a half
chapter or whatever it is,

324
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:55,078
whatever they call it, but I
like the way that they they

325
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:58,919
organize that because they kind
of realize that nobody is going

326
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,888
to really learn anything
sitting, consuming for an hour,

327
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,148
you know? or not, I shouldn't
say nobody. But you know, it's,

328
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,368
it's probably challenging for a
lot of people to do that. Do it

329
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:08,699
that way.

330
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,880
Debra-Kaye: And then some things
you will still have to Google.

331
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, yeah. Because some things
you just can't remember.

332
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:21,869
Dan Ott: on that, that's also
always true. I don't know, I've

333
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,660
been you know, I've been a
developer for for a while now.

334
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,710
And I google that mean, I google
things every, every day as that

335
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,079
I don't know, multiple times a
day, if you know, if I'm going,

336
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,529
I can't, I can't recover.
There's one. There's like an

337
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,529
array method that just a
JavaScript thing. That is just

338
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,380
like been the same for 100
years. And I, I literally just

339
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,430
can't remember the order of you
know how things go in. I look it

340
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,559
up every single time. I don't
know, I don't know what it is

341
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,230
mental block, but that Google is
top top developer tool.

342
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,569
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's,
I've been writing my blog with

343
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:00,420
markdown for a couple of years
now. And I can never remember

344
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,450
the right format for the link.
Like I googled it every single

345
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,630
time every years, right, and it
just wouldn't stick. And then I

346
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,539
had tweeted about it. And people
like offered me all of these

347
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,960
different ways to remember it.
And finally one of them clicked

348
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,099
and now now I don't have to
Google it, the brackets, the

349
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,519
brackets come first and the
parentheses come second, like a

350
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,430
function. I think that's what
they were kind of saying,

351
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,029
anyway, doesn't matter. It makes
sense to me. And now I don't

352
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,839
need to give up. But I did for
like two years straight. And I

353
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,180
think that's kind of part of the
other thing, too, right? Like,

354
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,839
sometimes you'll be presented
the information and somebody,

355
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,849
there will be 12 people that
give you a different

356
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:45,180
explanation. And that one
explanation will fit. And I

357
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,470
think there's a tendency for new
developers or people who are

358
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,789
learning to think about, well, I
can't get this in this other

359
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,420
person got it. And so I must not
be good enough for this, right.

360
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,460
And that's not true. It's just
not presented in a way that

361
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,630
makes sense to your brain or
something that's easily usable.

362
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,329
But that's why it's great to
have so many different people

363
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,970
writing blogs or creating
content, because there's more

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,210
options for you to kind of
search out and, and figure out

365
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,289
what works for you.

366
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,190
Debra-Kaye: That took me a while
to understand that and took me a

367
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,440
while to accept to because I was
like I sorted it, this should be

368
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,900
easy for me. And I kind of
thought going into this that it

369
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,069
would be so easy because I did a
degree in it. And when I did my

370
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:39,700
degree I did Java and c++. And
granted, I didn't understand a

371
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,890
thing in Java. Like, I just
couldn't get it. I mean that I

372
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,529
had to get so much help with
that course. And I did. c++, did

373
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:57,009
discrete maths and started
thinking called I can't remember

374
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,799
the name of the other course.
And I was like, Okay, I managed

375
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:03,490
to get through those granted a
lot of help because they were

376
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,480
just, it wasn't clicking. And my
issue was she loved programming.

377
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,609
Like she's like a hardcore
programmer. And she's like, you

378
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:16,630
should do this. And you should
go to your masters now. But I

379
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,319
just it just wasn't clicking.
And when I found out about web

380
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,680
development, I was like, Okay,
this should be easy for me to be

381
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,549
able to catch on because I
started it and I Tinker in it

382
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,000
all the time, but it just wasn't
clicking. And that kind of

383
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,529
starts to feel like, maybe it's
me. And especially when you see

384
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:38,470
so many other developers out
there who've been doing this for

385
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,700
five years, 10 years, 20 years,
and they make everything so

386
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,529
easy. You start to feel like
okay, maybe you're not just cut

387
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,440
up, maybe you're not cut out for
it. Maybe you're just this is

388
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,309
not for you. And it really took
me a while to realize that,

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,339
okay, I'm not the only person
who struggles with someone These

390
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:05,440
things like, it's actually not
as easy as people make it look,

391
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,400
for some people, it may click
quicker than some, but it's, if

392
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,839
it was kind of easy, everybody
would do it took me a while to

393
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,220
get to that place.

394
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:19,500
Dan Ott: Yeah, I think that's
really important. And I mean,

395
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,089
I'm glad to have gotten to that
realization, because it comes up

396
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:28,349
a lot. And I've been thinking
about this, I've been thinking

397
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,549
about this recently about how
everybody is, I keep saying

398
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,880
everybody, but lots of people
learn in ways similar to you,

399
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,279
right? Sort of on their own
different courses, you know,

400
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,640
maybe boot camps or whatever,
but much different than sort of

401
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,410
in school, right. And so, if you
were going in school, you'd be

402
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,579
in a class with other people.
And you're not following 7000

403
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,680
people who are already experts
at what you're learning. And so,

404
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,809
you know, and I've been thinking
about how to, like, approach

405
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,140
that, right? Because, on one
hand, I like following people

406
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,059
who are, you know, domain
experts in whatever it is I want

407
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,910
to learn about, but at the same
time, that that sort of

408
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,450
pressure, external pressure, and
it's not even the it's not even

409
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:21,269
those, anybody's fault, right.
But once you know, something,

410
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,880
you probably like to talk about
it. Right? But coming from when

411
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,819
you don't know it, you know,
it's just like you're saying, it

412
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:32,789
can seem it can seem like they
make it seem easy, you know, and

413
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,089
how to how to approach that like
learning process, when you're

414
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,710
when you're starting out. How to
avoid falling, falling into that

415
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,019
trap, you know, of like,
following all those people,

416
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,000
because you're like, Okay, let's
have developers to follow, you

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,450
know, like, follow these
different, different Twitter

418
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,619
accounts, and, or whatever it is
blog posts. And meanwhile,

419
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,589
there's like 1000s and 1000s
people in the exact same boat,

420
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,150
you know, struggling and, you
know, trying to push through

421
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,400
everything and trying to figure
out what to learn next, and

422
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:07,680
they're not on all the top
developers to follow lists, you

423
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,619
know, you know what I mean?
It's, I know, it's an

424
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:17,730
interesting problem. And I don't
have any solutions or anything,

425
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,950
but you know, it's an
interesting problem to think

426
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:26,430
about. And you're not like, I
just lots of people we talk to

427
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,609
here at Virtual Coffee, on the
podcast or in, you know, Virtual

428
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:34,319
Coffee proper, I guess, around
the table and then have the same

429
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,930
sort of realizations, you know,
that, like, it's a struggle,

430
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,960
it's hard. It's hard to learn.
And it's hard to learn anything

431
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:48,269
new. And I don't know, I have
been. Yep, I don't know. That's

432
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,660
the end of my thing. I don't
have any further, I don't really

433
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,150
have a question or a statement,
you know, but it's a very

434
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,170
interesting topic to me.

435
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,789
Debra-Kaye: It's something that
I also realized too, like, and

436
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,880
honestly, Virtual Coffee is the
committee that has made me feel

437
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,210
more comfortable asking
questions. But it is something

438
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,920
that I noticed too. You know,
even on Twitter, right? Even if

439
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,259
you decide to ask for some
wherever you ask questions,

440
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,390
especially as a newbie, like, I
am so good at overwhelming

441
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,420
myself with like, all the things
to learn all these things. But

442
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,380
sometimes when you ask like a
really a question that you think

443
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,519
in your head is really simple.
And I mean, it's not overly

444
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,369
complicated, but it's just, it
hasn't clicked for you yet. And

445
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,759
you may ask somebody who is an
experienced developer, and they

446
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,539
give you this really advanced
answer. And, you know, you do

447
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,880
this and you do this. And this,
like, I don't even know what

448
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,130
that is. And because they have
been doing this for a while,

449
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,619
they kind of don't really know
how to explain something in like

450
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,759
layman's terms to a beginner
where it like it will connect

451
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:03,539
the dots for you. And because I
even I'm learning it, and I'm,

452
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,740
like, a little bit more
comfortable with it now. But as

453
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,559
asking someone a person about
it, and they gave me like, this

454
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,170
answer was like, Oh, my god, I
don't even know what to do with

455
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,339
that. So is there any way to
like, avoid that right now?

456
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,890
Because I don't know how to do
that. And I'm gonna mess up

457
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,470
something if I try it. So it's
like also realizing for yourself

458
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:34,230
how you learn, and also to not
try to grab everything because

459
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,579
you need to learn everything. So
I like and I mean, even when you

460
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:42,089
Google stuff, too, like I said,
yesterday evening, reading a

461
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,900
blog post trying to fix
something in CSS, and I read the

462
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,019
article just like, I don't know,
five minutes long, and I still

463
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:55,109
didn't understand what to do. So
it's it's really, it's a tricky

464
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:59,579
kind of thing. Because some
people we don't know how to

465
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:04,680
break down the answer on your
level because they've been doing

466
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,170
it for so long, it's so natural
for them. And for you, it's not

467
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:12,119
really natural. So it's, it's,
it's a tricky, it's a, it's like

468
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,019
dicey. It's tricky.

469
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,529
Dan Ott: It is. And it can be,
it can even be not so much that

470
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:21,970
they don't know how but they
haven't. Like, maybe they don't

471
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,759
know you, personally very well
yet, or they don't know where

472
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,430
you are on your journey or any
person, you know. So if you're

473
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,509
answering a question, it's hard
to, like, intuitively calibrate,

474
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:36,039
you know, your, your answer, you
know what I mean, for a given

475
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,410
person, other than just talking
to them, which is what I do,

476
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,619
like when I'm when I'm like,
starting a pairing session with

477
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:45,460
somebody who I haven't worked
with before. Like, if they're,

478
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,299
if they're trying to solve a
specific problem, you know, the

479
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,819
first questions I sort of gauge
I like, I just try to gauge

480
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:55,690
like, where, you know, what,
like, where, what things they do

481
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,369
know, and what things they
don't, so that we can, like,

482
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,589
talk in the language that like,
both of us understand, you know,

483
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:06,460
because in a couple years, you
know, you're going to be, you're

484
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,170
just gonna have all that good
stuff under your belt, and

485
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,559
you're gonna forget about how
hard it was, you know? And then

486
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,569
and your answers, if somebody
asks the same question, we'll be

487
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:19,569
okay, we'll just do this. And
this, you know, and then it's

488
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:21,279
very easy, like, because that's
the process that's in your

489
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,279
brain, right? So like, Okay, how
do I do this? Oh, well, what I

490
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:29,410
would what Dan would do is, you
know, x y&z except if I don't

491
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,769
have, you know, if the person
doesn't know, at what x it means

492
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,160
that answer is useless. Right?
So calibrating like, trying to

493
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,500
figure out how to how to
calibrate those answers is

494
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,430
complicated, it doesn't fit
everybody, you know? Because if

495
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:47,259
they're answering that good
question. I don't know. Like,

496
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:52,750
like, there are ways, you know,
you could just write a book on

497
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,059
pretty much any question about
get, like, you know, what I

498
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,329
mean? Like, the answer to any
question on get, if you get all

499
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:02,079
the way down to it is like very
complicated, you know, and, and

500
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,180
same with react, and same with
JavaScript is all just a bunch

501
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,890
of House of Cards of different,
you know, different pieces of

502
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,759
data, you know, and it's just, I
feel, I feel, it's, it's, I

503
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,089
feel, I was gonna say feel bad,
it's not quite right. But like,

504
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,509
I can understand the struggle of
trying to learn all this stuff,

505
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,710
you know, at once, all at once,
you know, early, because when I

506
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:28,960
learned there was none of when I
was learning HTML and CSS there,

507
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:35,470
like, it didn't, it didn't even
exist. Yes, exactly. You know,

508
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,380
like, I didn't have to learn
git, or version control or

509
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,400
whatever, because we were just
like cobbling files up to like a

510
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,369
server, you know, it was bad.
Like, I'm glad that it exists

511
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,309
now. But it's complicated on its
own, you know, and it's this

512
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,640
whole, this whole thing, I
always try to tell people to

513
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,599
just learn one thing at once,
you know,

514
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,329
Debra-Kaye: it's kind of hard to
like, it's tricky, because like,

515
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:03,809
on one hand, like in your head,
you know, you need to focus on

516
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:07,559
one thing. So you can, like be
good at something. But at the

517
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,900
same time, with tech, you kind
of have to know how to do one or

518
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,259
two things at least. So you can
never really be learning one

519
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,670
thing alone, at whatever, at one
point in time, you kind of have

520
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,839
to know how to do at least two
things to go because they are

521
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:29,039
they connect somehow. So it's
kind of hard to just focus on

522
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,480
one thing. So it's, and that's
why people will get trapped into

523
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,869
whole learning to three
different languages at the same

524
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:40,259
time. Like, I'm not even trying
to learn frameworks yet. Because

525
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,829
like, I want to get really good
at JavaScript, cuz like, the

526
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:47,309
advice that I keep getting is,
if you get good at JavaScript,

527
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,490
or you can handle yourself with
it, then everything else will

528
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,009
come a little bit easier. So I'm
not really worried about

529
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,950
frameworks. I kind of already
know which framework I want to

530
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,210
learn first, which is view but
looks like down the road. And I

531
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,400
probably will learn react, of
course, because I noticed the

532
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,819
demand and everything. But
people will get caught up in the

533
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,269
all in the Buddhist framework is
hot right now, that is hot right

534
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:11,969
now. And people will be trying
to learn two, three at the same

535
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:17,250
time. And then there are really
an ad from what I have learned.

536
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,449
And I'm constantly being told,
like, get your basics, right.

537
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,809
And like once you get your
foundation set, then everything

538
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,559
else will come. And I'm trying
to get the foundation set. So

539
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,760
but it's really easy to get
caught up in the whole, you

540
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,179
know, hot new thing, and also
learning more than one thing at

541
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,079
a time because tech changes so
quickly, too. So it's kind of a

542
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,250
tricky balance.

543
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,070
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It is
really tricky. And I think what

544
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,679
works for one person doesn't
work for every person to write,

545
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,429
like we've been saying. And I
think, you know, sometimes

546
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:57,030
jumping into a framework might
be the way to go and like not

547
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,210
mastering all those things. I
know I think it was when I Went

548
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,130
from Ruby to rails. Ruby, like I
was kind of getting it. And but

549
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,940
then I hit rails. And I was
like, oh, okay, now suddenly,

550
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,230
this makes sense. And I'm not
sure what made it click, but

551
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,889
jumping into the framework
helped me to understand things a

552
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:21,750
lot better than I had before.
And so it was, you know, kind of

553
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,900
this backwards way of doing
things, but hearing other people

554
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,650
say like, Oh, yeah, I've done
that, too. There weren't as many

555
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,380
people saying that there were a
lot of people saying that's not

556
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,769
the right way to go. But it
there's not a right way and a

557
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:39,389
wrong way. There's the way that
works for you. And, you know,

558
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,389
it's great to be able to
recognize what those things are.

559
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,980
Yeah. No, deprecate. I know,
like learning on your own, I

560
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,760
went to a boot camp. And I feel
like that was challenging. I was

561
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,539
online, and I didn't have a
sense of community. But I'm sure

562
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,070
learning on your own is maybe
extra challenging, because you

563
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,260
are trying to like, find good
resources, and maybe find

564
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,039
communities. So I, you know, can
you talk a little bit about what

565
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,139
has been most challenging for
you?

566
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:19,360
Debra-Kaye: Yeah, so I have been
like trying to learn on my own

567
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,960
well this year would make it two
years. But they found that

568
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,690
before I found Virtual Coffee, I
was, I started to like, do a

569
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,519
little rabbit hole research. But
I was just like, trying to look

570
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,960
at too many things at once. And
I never had any one of I could

571
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,699
ask questions. And I was just
struggling because I would, I

572
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:48,639
was going through one free boot
camp. And I was even trying to

573
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,530
do the 100 days of code thing.
And if I missed the day, I would

574
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,780
just be like, okay, I messed up,
I'm gonna start over because I

575
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,480
wasn't really consistent. And I
wasn't really focused. And I had

576
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,599
no way to talk to about what I
was struggling with. So it was

577
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,710
just difficult. So I would start
and stop and start and stop. And

578
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,849
if I did good for a week, and I
missed two days, because I just

579
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,840
was too burnt out to do it. I
was like, Okay, let's start

580
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,849
over. No, because I kind of
messed it up and had no way to

581
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,670
keep me accountable as couldn't
ask the questions, I will be

582
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,820
like, going through the bootcamp
didn't understand what I was

583
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,829
doing, and had nobody to ask and
felt like, okay, it's not for

584
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:38,949
me, because it's not clicking,
why is it not clicking? Now get

585
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:42,280
frustrated, and the frustration
would just cause me to be like,

586
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:48,489
okay, it's not working. And then
when I would see like, someone

587
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:52,179
tweet, like, Hey, I'm struggling
with this. And I'm like, okay,

588
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:57,400
it's not me alone. So maybe I
should try again. And then I

589
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,829
will try again, then get
frustrated at some point and

590
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:04,570
stop again. So that was really
like actually actively looking

591
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:10,090
for a community that I felt
comfortable in. And when I

592
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,079
finally found Virtual Coffee,
and I was like, Oh, my god. But

593
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,079
it really took me a while
because studying on your own

594
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:24,190
like, on one hand, self paced,
boot camps are great. But if you

595
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:30,070
have no one who is in it with
you, and you have no one to ask

596
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,289
questions, or be like, Hey, I'm
not getting this is it me. And

597
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,619
for someone to tell you that
it's not you, it's actually

598
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:42,130
normal to struggle through this
process. And it's like a long

599
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,239
journey. Like, I have no problem
with learning forever because I

600
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,019
constant learner. So I have no
problem learning forever. Like,

601
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,340
that's my thing. But when you
have when you know that there

602
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,849
are people who are also
struggling, and can help you to

603
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:01,449
get through those rough patches,
and encourage you, it is not

604
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:05,289
you, you're going to get it.
It's okay. It's not getting it

605
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:10,329
today, but you will get it Don't
worry about it. And to kind of

606
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:14,139
talk you out of procrastinating
and talk to you all itself,

607
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:18,940
talking yourself, although
stuff. That's a great thing took

608
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,139
me a while to find that space.
But that was me that I was just

609
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:29,440
like, up and down, up and down.
Start today start next week,

610
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:36,039
frustrated, okay? I have no one
to talk to about it. And more so

611
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,380
me it's not really you, it's
normal and you won't get it in a

612
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,219
month. You won't get it in a
day. So it was that was really

613
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,159
instrumental for me because I
when you study on your own, it's

614
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,900
just not. And we don't really
even even without the pandemic

615
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,769
like I don't really have anyone
who like is like really Intertek

616
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,550
or wants to learn this thing. So
to find a community where You

617
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,289
people have the same interest as
you. And they actually went

618
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:07,239
through it. So they kind of know
what you're struggling with and

619
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,280
understand like, hey, this was
shiny for me too. Or maybe you

620
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,369
could think about it this way,
like some suggestions, anything,

621
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:20,650
but just something to help you
realize that it's, it's normal

622
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,889
for you to struggle through this
because the learning curve is

623
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:27,730
steep, and you're not going to
get it overnight.

624
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:30,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
like That's it. That's it,

625
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,219
right? It's normal for you to
struggle through this because

626
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:35,829
there's so much I don't know if
I would call it imposter

627
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:39,280
syndrome or whatever. doubts
that comes when you're like, I'm

628
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,190
struggling, that must mean I'm
not good at this, or I'm not

629
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,369
meant to do this. And that's not
true at all. Right? we all

630
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,619
struggle through it, or most of
us.

631
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,710
Debra-Kaye: That's exactly it,
like the imposter syndrome is is

632
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,219
real. Like, I know, people talk
about this, I know that there's

633
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,969
so many articles I have read
them, I have watched the videos,

634
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,940
but when you're trying to learn
something, and when you're like,

635
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:09,349
why is it not easy for me? Or as
easy for me? Or why is it that

636
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,789
this person like gets it and I'm
not getting it, the imposter

637
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:17,929
syndrome will be like, it will
tell you stuff that it will

638
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:21,050
really make you procrastinate.
And I spent a lot of time

639
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,440
procrastinating too, because I
just like I'm not getting it. So

640
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,429
it's me, I'm not getting it. And
then we're taught myself how to

641
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:33,650
stop because this like, it's not
for me, it's not cooking. So

642
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,150
maybe I'm not cut out for this.
So imposter syndrome is so real.

643
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:43,880
And like, I know, maybe even
last year, developers may think

644
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:47,360
Oh, these your developers talk
about imposter syndrome, they

645
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,360
didn't know that I still have
it. Or maybe as a senior, you

646
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,349
may not have it as much because
you have some experience. But as

647
00:41:54,349 --> 00:42:00,050
a junior with where and how tech
is now 2021, a lot of things

648
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,889
have changed. And you know,
tools and all these things will

649
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:07,489
always be coming Oh, but when
you're just starting to learn

650
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:13,820
something, and you have to try
to get up to par with where the

651
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,760
text base is today. And you have
such a long way to go. Seniors

652
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,599
don't really think because they
have already passed that stage.

653
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,980
And I really understand that
imposter syndrome for a junior

654
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,079
s probably even more than wh t
they feel now, because they

655
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,130
ve been doing it for 5-10 years
So you know, you can have an

656
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,949
dea of what you're doing. You k
ow, you don't know everything,

657
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:42,769
but you kind of know what yo 're
doing to a point. But a ju

658
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:47,150
ior who has no clue what the 're
doing, has like 1000 times

659
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,179
the imposter syndrome, becaus we
don't know what we're do

660
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:54,599
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
that senior devs are just better

661
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,900
at hiding their imposter
syndrome. And like over the last

662
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,340
year, I have been surprised at
so many of our members who I

663
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,940
would have expected to be super
confident in things say that

664
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,300
they're nervous about doing it,
or they don't know if they're

665
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,679
good enough to be doing this
thing. And that was so eye

666
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,769
opening for me because I thought
like, wow, you know, they're

667
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:20,909
here. They're doing great.
They've had this amazing career.

668
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,650
But it was it was just like
this, this hidden thing, where I

669
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,820
think people on this journey
where a lot of us are openly

670
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,579
talking about it, which is
great. And I think that that

671
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,530
should happen more. But it's
been, you know, like we're all

672
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,400
here in tech grows and moves so
quickly that it makes sense that

673
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,639
we frequently don't feel like we
know what we're doing. Because

674
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:45,960
we can't it just keeps moving.

675
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:52,199
Dan Ott: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I I
don't know, it's one of those

676
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:58,949
things where it for me, I it
makes sense that a person would

677
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:01,260
struggle with learning, like
learning to be a developer,

678
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,840
like, for the first time,
because I can't remember if I

679
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,929
can actually remember it being
very hard. You know, it's hard.

680
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:17,219
And I think, as somebody who
like in a senior developer role

681
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:22,110
I, it's the imposter syndrome
rears its head all the time, but

682
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,699
sort of different, right?
Because, like, not different.

683
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:30,030
It's in different spots, right?
Because I do like, I'm not like,

684
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,320
it's more like, Okay, well, what
if, I don't know, I don't know

685
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,030
how to phrase this. Like, what
if everybody finds out, you

686
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:42,000
know, like, that's the thing,
you know, like, it's, I'm not

687
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,980
finding trying to find a job for
the first time and I'm not

688
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,809
trying to, like learn this whole
new thing, you know, but so

689
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:51,900
it's, I don't know, if it's
like, just not as sharply like

690
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,820
you were saying, like, maybe
when you're learning for the

691
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,309
first time it's, it happens more
often or something and that

692
00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:00,179
might be true, you know? Right.
Right. Right. But yeah, You

693
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:04,440
know, and I feel like once
you're there, and also back to

694
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,360
what you said, we never like,
it's it's the this sort of

695
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:12,059
feeling, I feel like once you
are more experienced, like, once

696
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:16,949
you've been doing I think for a
long time is a little bit more

697
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:20,039
under the surface, even under
your own like, like

698
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,050
subconscious, you know,
sometimes I'm like, I don't have

699
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:30,659
imposter syndrome, I just
embedded This is like what I say

700
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:33,389
to myself, like, oh, wait a
minute, that's, you know, like,

701
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:36,150
those are like feelings that I
have. Often even, you know,

702
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:39,239
like, trying to push through
these things, it still happens.

703
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:42,420
I think it happens to a lot of
people. And you know, some

704
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,539
people don't talk about it, some
people don't realize that it is

705
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:50,219
happening or you know. And then
and then some people do talk

706
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:50,820
about it, but--

707
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:57,329
Debra-Kaye: And then too, sorry,
and then also, as a junior, I

708
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:01,230
guess, because while you have
some senior developers who are

709
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,809
more open about talking about
the imposter syndrome, and then

710
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:06,690
there are others who, you know,
you don't really see that, you

711
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,079
know, they cannot make it look
like Oh, I'm so good at this not

712
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,579
been doing this for 20 years.
But as a junior, because we

713
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,380
don't really see seniors talk
about that they haven't pursued

714
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,840
and we think, you know, they're
so good at this, like, they know

715
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,800
it, because they've been doing
this for so long. So we're like,

716
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:35,460
when are we ever going to feel
comfortable knowing enough? and

717
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,909
be able to show that we know
enough? Because and like no

718
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:42,570
enough is like a relative of
course, because you know, this

719
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,440
space is like so crazy, where
you know, there are always new

720
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,639
things to learn. And I love
that. But also, it's almost

721
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:56,550
like, from a newbie you you kind
of feel like, when will I apart

722
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,039
from trying to actually learn
the things? I'm going to do it?

723
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:05,250
It's almost like, when will I
ever feel like I know enough?

724
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,530
And how can I show someone, you
know, a company, a contractor,

725
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,539
whatever, that I know enough to
do this. And because we don't

726
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:21,210
really see the senior developers
openly showing that, hey, you

727
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,500
kind of won't know everything,
and it's okay. And you may see

728
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,960
me here 20 years later, but I
was at the same point you were

729
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:34,349
and when I started, things were
much different. Things have

730
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:38,639
changed a lot now. So it's okay,
you will get there. And you

731
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:45,329
don't have to try to get to my
20 year veteran, but just get

732
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,579
comfortable with enough things
that you can do whatever you're

733
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,429
required to do, or you know how
to go about learning how to do

734
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,960
it? Yeah,

735
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:58,829
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think we
were just in the book club

736
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:02,309
meeting. And somebody there has
been a developer for 15 years.

737
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,619
But as a freelance developer,
and one of the things they were

738
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,889
talking about was, they don't
have feedback from anyone,

739
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,460
because they take on freelance
clients. And so they don't ever

740
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,849
really know how they're doing
right. And I think that's also

741
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:18,539
plays into this role of
learning, especially on your

742
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,199
own, or in a place where you're
not getting feedback from people

743
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,460
because you are kind of your own
reference point. And you're you

744
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,039
are looking like Dan was saying,
you follow all these people on

745
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,010
Twitter, right, who have been
doing this for years. And so

746
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,980
then it becomes you and these
people that you're looking at,

747
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,059
and you have no one to kind of
look at what you're doing and

748
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,480
say like, Look, you're doing a
great job. And this is amazing.

749
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,269
And hey, I didn't know that
thing. And I've been doing it

750
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:50,460
this long rate. And so that lack
of community response or

751
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,409
feedback can be really
challenging to gauge where you

752
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,010
are.

753
00:48:57,329 --> 00:49:01,409
Debra-Kaye: Yeah, yeah. And they
did to me a while to like,

754
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
connect those dots too. Because
when you're learning on your

755
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,019
own, you really don't have
anyone to bypass ideas have to

756
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,559
be like, Hey, I don't know what
this means. Can you walk me

757
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:19,889
through this? And also, as a new
person, one of the things that I

758
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:24,210
learned the hard way is asking
for help. Because you don't want

759
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,579
to look like I mean, you don't
know what you're doing. But you

760
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,650
kind of don't want anyone to
know that you don't know what

761
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,869
you're doing. So it took me a
while to ask questions. And

762
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,489
sometimes it's also a case of
finding the right people to ask

763
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,369
those questions, because not
everyone will be willing to

764
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:44,820
assist you. But find the right
people who are willing to help

765
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,480
and would actually encourage you
to ask questions. That was a big

766
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,650
thing for me because I don't
like to ask for help. It kind of

767
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,880
sounds weird, but you don't want
to seem like you have no clue

768
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,539
what you're doing. But you also
what I've learned is that It is

769
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:05,699
better to ask questions than to
sit there and struggle and you

770
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:07,650
know, doing the wrong thing, and
you have no idea that you're

771
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,400
doing the wrong thing, or you're
going about it the wrong way. So

772
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,019
asking for help is really
important. And when you find a

773
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:19,530
great community that you can ask
for help, or the person that

774
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,219
that you know, who is willing to
assist you. And they will

775
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,090
actually walk you through
something, you realize, Oh, so I

776
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,800
kind of got a but I just went
wrong, right here. Or I could

777
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,670
think about it this way. So
asking practice are really is a

778
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:39,960
really big thing. But new people
are suppose as newbies, we don't

779
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,489
like to ask for help, because we
just don't want to look like we

780
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:47,070
have no clue what we're doing.
We don't but we don't want

781
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,269
anyone to know that. So, yeah,
that's my focus really, really a

782
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:51,989
big thing, too.

783
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,519
Dan Ott: Yeah. I mean, I don't
really have anything to add,

784
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,710
other than I love that if I
think it's great advice. I think

785
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,809
asking questions is important.
And I think it's a burden for

786
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:04,170
everybody at every level, you
know, but just like you're

787
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,710
saying, you know, you're saying
you didn't want to, I don't

788
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,349
know, appear like you didn't
know anything, or whatever. But

789
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,750
the fact that you're working on
anything, have a question to ask

790
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,869
even as evidence enough, that,
that you that you do know,

791
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:21,269
things, you know what I mean?
And I don't know, it's, it's

792
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:23,820
possible to struggle through
everything all by yourself, you

793
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,989
know, it is possible, but it's
much easier with, with people,

794
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,550
and it's not even just like
learning how to be a dev or

795
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,300
whatever, you know, any problem
you're struggling with, you

796
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,260
know, is, is at some point going
to be better if you can get

797
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,289
somebody else to, like, look at
it, or, you know, talk through

798
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:47,880
your, your mental process, or
whatever it is, you know, asking

799
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,010
questions is just, it's just
such a useful tool, you know, an

800
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,139
important important thing to
keep in mind.

801
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,750
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
think, to go along with that,

802
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,409
you call it a useful tool. And I
think that's a good way to frame

803
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:06,820
it, right, because it is
something that we need to

804
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,519
develop. And it's something that
we need to use often. And I

805
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,329
think if you could learn that
while you're learning, it's so

806
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:17,230
important, because it took me a
lot longer to learn about asking

807
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,380
questions, and when to ask
questions. for a lot of reasons

808
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,559
you said, Debra-Kaye, you know,
I was like working, but I didn't

809
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,679
want anybody to think I didn't
know what I was doing. And so

810
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:32,920
then I just like, I don't know,
I was trying to, you know, carve

811
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,550
a mountain and no that I was
just gonna go and do this

812
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,340
analogy. And it's just not not
gonna work.=

813
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,860
So the point is, ask questions
early.

814
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,940
Dan Ott: No, no, I want to know
what it was.

815
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,360
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Like, I can
see the image in my head too, of

816
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,900
like, where it was going and how
it would play out.It looks cool,

817
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,860
but doesn't translate.

818
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,739
Dan Ott: There's a podcast, I
listened to that. They've built

819
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:15,119
up this very complicated
metaphor for like brain

820
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,949
processes. And like it's, it's
it's a it's a, it's complicated,

821
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:22,230
and they built it up in like,
the first couple episodes, and

822
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,530
then they just use it the rest
of the time. And so they're

823
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,159
like, referring to these weird
things. Like, I think if you

824
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:31,380
jump in the middle of like, if
you just listen to the most

825
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,510
recent podcast episode, you have
no idea what they're talking

826
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,429
about. But I

827
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,860
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: -- that's
what I was trying to avoid.

828
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:49,340
Exactly. Okay, so we're like,
trying to see what we have.

829
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:53,840
We're just about at time. So I
just want to know before, I

830
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,820
don't want to wrap up if there's
something else that you want to

831
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,389
talk about. So if there's
anything else that you want to

832
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:00,559
cover, we can go ahead.

833
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:07,099
Debra-Kaye: No, I mean, I just
want to say that I encourage

834
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:12,590
people to play me encouraging
someone to ask questions and to

835
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:18,500
not be afraid to put yourself
out there that took me a long

836
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,360
time to get comfortable doing
that. still working on it. But

837
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:31,639
you have to get to a point where
you're willing to take a little

838
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:38,210
tiny step and ask a question and
ask for help and share something

839
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,239
that you think you don't know,
but can actually help someone

840
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:47,780
else. And it took me a long time
to get there. Because I even

841
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,280
like just started blogging, not
just started but last year, late

842
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,340
last year, and I was like, you
know how to write about tech and

843
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:59,420
I don't know anything about
tech, but I've just been like

844
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,579
trying to write about My
experience in learning my

845
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:05,780
learning journey, and the way
that I saw it resonate with

846
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,429
other people. I was like, No,
some are the only one who feels

847
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:16,730
this way. Cool. And that kind of
helps show me that I'm not alone

848
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,119
in in the struggle, and like, I
knew I was ventually getting,

849
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:26,269
but when I saw other people
responding like, this is me to a

850
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:30,260
team and was like, Okay, cool.
So it's not only me, that's

851
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,309
really cool. Like, that was like
the highlight of my day when I

852
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:38,059
read that feedback. Like, okay,
cool. That means I'm on the

853
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:41,119
right track. It's not only me,
this is kind of cool.

854
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,940
Dan Ott: Yeah, I love that. I, I
don't know, that's always a

855
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,079
piece of advice I give to
everybody to is is writing at

856
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:53,659
any point, any point in your in
your journey, you know what I

857
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:57,170
mean? But like the those, it's
so valuable to share those

858
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,099
experiences, you know, I get
appreciate it down the road to

859
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:04,519
when, when you're, you know, was
an old developer who's been

860
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,079
around the road and, you know,
reading back, I mean, I mean, I

861
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:13,219
had I have blog posts from, you
know, early in my career, I

862
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:18,679
guess, but they're not. I was in
college when I was learning for

863
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,139
the first time, I was still on
my own. I wasn't learning in

864
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:24,260
college. But But like, I didn't
mean, I wasn't writing any of

865
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,460
this down. And I do wish I had
even just for myself records,

866
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,889
you know, of this sort of thing.
I think it's I think it's very

867
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:34,219
cool. And a very good idea. for
a lot of reasons.

868
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:40,909
Debra-Kaye: Yeah. Someone wrote
a blog post about that. I think

869
00:56:40,909 --> 00:56:47,030
it was I can't remember if it
was swyx, on Twitter, Shawn,

870
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,190
somebody who I think it was him,
but just the idea of like

871
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:56,780
documenting your journey,
because not really for anyone's

872
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,469
benefit, per se, but for your
own benefit. Because I've seen a

873
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:04,429
lot of developers see that the
maybe solve a problem. And they

874
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:06,980
wrote about it. And then when
they forgot how to do it, they

875
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,309
would search and find by their
own blogs and be like, Oh,

876
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:14,539
actually, what about this, to
remind themselves how to do that

877
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:18,739
thing or help solve that
problem. So I and I like to

878
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:22,070
write and but I'm always
something like what I write

879
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:25,610
about. So like, my job is always
what am I What am I going to

880
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,269
write about? Because I don't
know it yet. But writing is

881
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:36,139
something that I definitely want
to continue when, like, have it

882
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:39,440
be a part of my thing, because I
always did like to write I did

883
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,909
my blog before but not tech
blogs. Because I always had the

884
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:50,570
thinking that I have to actually
be an expert in it before I can

885
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,590
write about it. So and that's
why I always procrastinated on

886
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,380
trying to blog because I'm like,
I don't know enough to write

887
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,329
about it yet. So what am I going
to write? Yeah. So it's, it's

888
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,800
it's a it's a journey.

889
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,550
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's for
sure. Okay, you have given us so

890
