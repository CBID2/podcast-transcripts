00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season one, episode

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,320
eight of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,679
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,489
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,549
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,369
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,479
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co host, Dan.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,079
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today,
we are joined by none other than

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,859
Kirk Shillingford, a software
developer from Dominica, who in

10
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,009
his words has been haphazardly
writing code for about seven

11
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,250
years. Kirk is also one of
Virtual Coffee's Community Ma

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,619
ntainers and a good friend to us
both. We talk about making mi

13
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,039
takes, empathy and developer te
ms and the importance of ha

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,390
ing a supportive community.

15
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,760
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,579
like we start every Virtual
Coffee - we introduce ourselves

17
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,329
with our name, where we're from
what we do and a random check in

18
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,739
question. Today's question is,
what is your favorite geometric

19
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,430
shape? And why? We hope you
enjoy this episode.

20
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,609
I'm Bekah, I am a front end
developer from a small town in

21
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:41,390
Ohio. And my favorite geometric
shape is it's either a triangle

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,280
or a Pentagon, and probably
because they are single digit

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,879
odd numbers. And that makes me
feel happy inside.

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,260
Dan Ott: Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a
front end developer from

25
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,450
Cleveland. And my favorite
geometric shape. I don't know I

26
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,300
don't think I have one. I i've
been I like a hexagon. Because

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,780
it sounds cool. And octagon
because I my my favorite

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,539
transformer was Optimus Prime
when I was a kid. And I mean

29
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:22,490
still obviously. But I named my
hamster after him. But was

30
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,740
Didn't you know actually know
what his name was? So I call

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,310
them "octomus", you know? And
then we just call the hamster on

32
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,330
octo all the time. So right. Cuz
I am awesome.

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,590
Kirk Shillingford: Hi, my name
is Kirk. I'm a full stack

34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,060
developer from the small island
of Dominica. And my favorite

35
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,020
geometric shape is the
dodecahedron. And obviously,

36
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,250
that needs no explanation.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Dan Ott: So that's a 20 sided
right.

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,090
Kirk Shillingford: It's the 12
sides, sir,

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,169
Dan Ott: well, what's the 20
sided one?

40
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,159
Kirk Shillingford: Oh, icosagon.
How could you confuse those two?

41
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,319
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think you
two are making these things up.

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,099
Kirk Shillingford: If we want to
make this entire podcast about

43
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,139
geometry, I can totally do that.

44
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,219
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I like
math, but geometry is my least

45
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:18,219
favorite. So we're gonna pass.

46
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:19,930
Kirk Shillingford: You're
probably like one of those

47
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:20,860
people.

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,509
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Spatial
spatial things are not they

49
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:33,520
don't work in my brain. Okay,
Kirk, we are super happy to have

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,919
you actually back on the podcast
because you co hosted one of our

51
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,180
episodes, the one with Marie
earlier in the season. So it is

52
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,430
good to have you here with us
today. And first, we'll start

53
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,689
off with your origin story. For
those who don't know. So tell us

54
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,169
a little bit about how you got
to where you are as a developer

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,530
and how you came to Virtual
Coffee.

56
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,409
Kirk Shillingford: I thought
this was a whiteboard interview.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,469
That changes everything about

58
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:08,229
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: About
geometric shapes? That's why you

59
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,789
knew that, you were prepared.

60
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,210
Kirk Shillingford: People take
the strangest Google questions,

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,379
you know. Yeah. Okay, let's
let's talk about how this all

62
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:24,959
started. picture it. Dominica
2014-15. I was in fourth form.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
You guys, you know, fourth form?

64
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:29,339
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: No.

65
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,639
Kirk Shillingford: Okay.
sophomores, sophomore, junior

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,180
high school.

67
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,379
Dan Ott: Got it.

68
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,949
Kirk Shillingford: And back then
my school had there was

69
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,680
information technology and there
were contracts, information

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,660
technology, technical and
information technology in

71
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,329
general. These names are
relevant because they are not

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,060
they have absolutely nothing to
do with anything. The technical

73
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,300
was like all Microsoft, it was
like, Word, Excel access. That

74
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,800
whole thing, publisher, all that
stuff. And general was the one

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,329
that had like actual programs.
And I had no idea what that was

76
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:08,100
even about. So I'm like, okay, I
should do this one. That train

77
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,810
of thought would like, be the
next 10 years of my life. So

78
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,069
yeah, we got into it, and it was
purple pascall which for some

79
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,930
reason, the Caribbean
examinations Council was like,

80
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,379
this is a relevant language that
people should learn. And I heard

81
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,870
that they still use the real
basketball, like, you can still

82
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,290
submit projects into a
basketball, which is terrifying.

83
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,100
But yeah, so we were in this
class, and it was like, 10 of

84
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,600
us. And the teacher was like,
I've never done this before. So

85
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:48,600
you know, go for it. And that
was like the most, it was like

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,040
one of my most fun classes is
because like, we were just

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,120
learning and like, I think the
internet like we get like search

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,370
stuff. But obviously, it wasn't
like now. So you're just like

89
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,160
finding like weird stuff in
forums. And we were just like,

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,850
messing with the code. And like,
nothing, nothing was like clever

91
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,939
back then. So you could not
enter for loops and just like,

92
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,709
eat up all the ram on the
machine, and just crash

93
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,769
computer, which we thought was
hilarious. And then somebody

94
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:19,889
figured out how to get the code
to, like, produce sounds. So you

95
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,879
could like, do the Star Wars
Darth Vader theme, just using

96
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,389
like computer beeps. And that
was like, really fun. And I

97
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,310
remember my final project was
BMI calculator thing, like the

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,300
project didn't have to be
complicated. And, you know, I

99
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,990
don't stand by that code. Nor do
I stand by BMI. But it was like

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,629
my first time actually doing
that. And that was pretty cool.

101
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,209
And then I didn't touch code for
like, three or four years.

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,730
Because in my head like I would,
that was not my thing. My thing

103
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,410
was maths. So I take our math,
and that that became

104
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,920
engineering. And still, it was
very much like, there's no

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,160
concept like I liked it, but it
wasn't like, Okay, this is not,

106
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,959
there was no point where like,
this is a career until two years

107
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,329
into my environmental
engineering degree. I just was

108
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:18,629
at a conference, and I saw like
a bunch of people in T shirts,

109
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,089
whereas everyone, every other
person in this conference is

110
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,879
wearing a suit. And they're just
some company wearing like blue t

111
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,160
shirts. And I'm like, Okay,
let's find out what these folks

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,120
are about. And of course, they
were software consultancy, and

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,649
they're like, Hey, you want to
take our tests, and they gave me

114
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,019
like this logic test. This is
pretty neat. And then they put

115
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,329
me through way too many
interviews. And then I got an

116
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:44,279
internship with it. That was
kind of like my segue back into

117
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,329
programming. Like, oh, this is
pretty fun. And it was like,

118
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,509
helping me with, like,
traditional engineering stuff.

119
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,240
And then that just became like,
okay, just want to do more of

120
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,370
this and less of the other
stuff. And then that just

121
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,550
became, oh, I guess I do this
now. So now I am here at this

122
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,180
podcast.

123
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,769
Dan Ott: That's pretty crazy.
That's awesome. That it was

124
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:08,060
like, sort of a random happening
that you you know, you ran into

125
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,490
those people at that at that
conference, you know, do you

126
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,910
think you would have not like,
not found your way to or back

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,269
to, you know, developing, if
that hadn't happened?

128
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:25,519
Kirk Shillingford: Um, I'm
pretty sure. I mean, and it's a

129
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,180
weird thing now. Like, I still
don't feel like there's a

130
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,040
difference between the stuff
that I like, and the things that

131
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,179
I think that I'm actually good
at, like math, and I guess

132
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,110
programming or things that I
like to do, I don't necessarily

133
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,070
feel a particular aptitude for
them, like, ah, like, this is

134
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,200
what my brain is supposed to be
doing. But in a weird way, it's

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,870
been more things like writing
and just just like a different

136
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:05,029
style of a different style of
communication. But when I found

137
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,730
them, it was just like, an
interesting alternative. Because

138
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,899
I spent two years in this world
of these, like very, very

139
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,230
serious engineering people, you
know, like, they wear ties to

140
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,799
work, and they build like
structures and like, everything

141
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,500
is super critical. Like if you
don't do this, you will poison

142
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,659
the town's water supply, you
know. And then I meet these,

143
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,509
like, sort of strange people who
are like, Oh, yeah, we don't

144
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,830
like we do work. But like, all
the sort of like trappings and

145
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,049
structure that I associated
with, like professional

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,070
environments, which is
different. And I found that

147
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,379
really appealing, like, okay,
these people just like, they

148
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,669
just want me to do the work.
They don't have to, like, put

149
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:53,330
myself in this cookie cutter
sort of template to do it. And

150
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
yeah, so I don't know if I
hadn't meant that. I might still

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,870
be just a traditional engineer,
I guess. And to be fair, like, I

152
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,690
didn't changed my major, like,
once I met them, who's like,

153
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,379
okay, I realize like, oh,
software is more than just this

154
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,860
fun thing that I did in high
school. It's actually this

155
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,669
pretty useful and important
tool. And I'm not terrible at

156
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,110
doing it. So that was fun.

157
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,139
Dan Ott: That's really cool.

158
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,009
Kirk Shillingford: I think it
was cool. Also, they paid me way

159
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,549
too much money. Like as an
intern, they never had interns

160
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:36,419
before. So they just like gave
us like regular dev salaries.

161
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,179
And I'm like, Okay, this can
work too that was also quite

162
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:39,600
nice.

163
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:48,120
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Nice. Okay,
so I also want to talk a

164
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:53,370
little bit about how you came to
Virtual Coffee. And you've been

165
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:56,370
hugely involved in what we're
doing, and helping support the

166
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,970
community for a while. And we'll
get to that a little bit later

167
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,720
on. But just how did you
discover Virtual Coffee? And do

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,230
you remember the first time you
came

169
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,179
Kirk Shillingford: This is my
favorite story because I want to

170
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,519
make this clear. I knew Bekah
first, I knew Bekah before she

171
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:22,440
grew up. All right, way back,
was still underground. Okay, at

172
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,450
some point, I want to say, like
very, very early on, we you were

173
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,679
still in flat iron. He started
tweeting about coding. And I

174
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,500
have started following you.
Because I remember I was on this

175
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,350
like, very determined thing to
not follow people who had like

176
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,049
10s of 1000s of you know, like
these sort of like big tech

177
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,830
things like these people not
relevant to my life. And you

178
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,990
just posted a tweet saying like,
Hey, I'm trying this thing, and

179
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,179
I don't know if it's going to
work out. That's how I feel.

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,440
And, you know, then you do that
thing where like your Twitter

181
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,019
friends or someone like you see
them post and you just like,

182
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,929
hey, support, encouragement, and
kind of did that for a while.

183
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,419
And then I remember you started
posting about PC. And I was

184
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,830
like, that's during work time. I
can't do that. So I think I

185
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,100
missed maybe like the first
month or two. But eventually,

186
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,789
you know, just like, this sounds
like a lot of fun. Like work

187
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:24,720
stopping right now. So I think,
When was the first time it came,

188
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:32,549
I want to say it's May or June.
Okay. Yeah. And I definitely, I

189
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,710
came once and I didn't come
again for like a couple months,

190
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,820
but I joined the slack. And like
the slack was a big thing.

191
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,360
Because even like when I was
working, like I could still like

192
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,899
hang out in slack kind of see
what was going on. But I would

193
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,419
also see people like Ah, the
meeting was so great. And that's

194
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:55,169
that's kind of just how it
happened. Yes, I want to make it

195
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,389
absolutely fundamentally clear.
I knew Bekah first.

196
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,539
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I want to
say it took me a long time to

197
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,460
realize who you were because
your Twitter picture was not a

198
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,289
picture of you. It was his it
wasn't green. Okay. It was

199
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,429
something so that it's always
funny to see people who their

200
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,100
Twitter picture either doesn't
look like them or something

201
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,330
totally different. And then it
takes me like a really long time

202
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,940
for that to click and like, Oh,
that's that person I've been

203
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,690
talking to for all of that time.
So that was also you I did not

204
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,139
recognize you because you are
not a Pokemon in fact.

205
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,169
Kirk Shillingford: Debatable.

206
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:46,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That should
have been our question if you

207
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,659
could be a Pokemon which one
would you be and why?

208
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,190
Kirk: Oh, my answers. I just
gotta check my Twitter. But

209
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,789
yeah, I mean, I remember like,
we had the whole like, gay Kirk

210
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,330
kerfuffle. Like when this it all
just started right is like

211
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,309
online I've always used like the
same like TK shoe type handle.

212
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,120
Yeah. And then when I met you
guys, I'm like, Okay, well, this

213
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,490
I guess this is this is still
online. And then it just like,

214
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,029
in the nature of friendship, you
know, like you kept interacting

215
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,970
with like, more and more of my
life and it's like, Hey, why are

216
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,769
you TK here in Kirk here and
like, Are you blind to us? So

217
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,230
you know, eventually we just had
to

218
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,870
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
right, when Kirk finally

219
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,419
accepted us. He allowed us not
to call him TK which we had been

220
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,139
calling him and said we're all
friends now. And so now you can

221
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,169
call me Kirk but it took a while
for him to warm up to us.

222
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,409
Kirk Shillingford: Just like how
the French have like Jew and you

223
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:47,370
know said same.

224
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:54,240
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I do not
speak French. The number of

225
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,759
times. French in front of me. I
don't understand it.

226
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,360
Kirk Shillingford: All people
from Ohio speak French. Is that

227
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,809
true? Dan?

228
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:04,830
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Do you
speak French?

229
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:05,220
Dan Ott: No...

230
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,860
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Pretty
French?

231
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,879
Dan Ott: No, I took three years
of German in high school. I

232
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,600
think I can count to 10 in
German stuff. But that's about

233
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,779
it.

234
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,000
Kirk Shillingford: Do a for loop
in German.

235
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,230
Dan Ott: That class was a mess.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,429
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay,
speaking of No, that's terrible

237
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:39,509
segue not gonna do it. Normally,
when we have people on the

238
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,240
podcast, we have some idea of
what we're going to talk about

239
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,990
with them. And I had lots of
different ideas about what we

240
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,570
should talk about with Kirk. But
I said, you know, what are you

241
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,990
interested in talking about and
Kirk said, making mistakes, and

242
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,940
I just thought, like, That's
such a fantastic topic. Um, but

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,539
I just want to get a little bit
of insight into one you answered

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,220
pretty quickly, I feel like and
to why was this a topic that

245
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,909
appealed to

246
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,789
Kirk Shillingford: the topic
appeal to me, because honestly,

247
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:19,879
when I think of my journey, and
tech, and I guess just my

248
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,629
professional life in general,
eat for better or worse, I see

249
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:27,169
is like a series of like
mistakes, good moments, but but

250
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:31,549
ultimately mistakes. And, you
know, there's been all these

251
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,399
conversations, you know, with
our members, especially like,

252
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
what is a junior engineer? What
is a senior engineer? You know,

253
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,649
what am I supposed to be? I'm
just, like, I'm here. I've been

254
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:50,059
writing code professionally. For
five years, if you count, like

255
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,980
for my internships, maybe like,
seven years. I don't feel

256
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,500
particularly like, I don't feel
particularly senior, I don't

257
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,100
feel particularly Junior. And I
have been, I don't really know

258
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,259
how to, like, quantify the
things that I've done, except

259
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,380
that, like, I know, like, the
lessons I've learned from like,

260
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,480
all the places that I went. And
I feel like every time I have

261
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,670
gotten better at being a
developer, it was like,

262
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,599
immediately following a mistake
or something wrong. And at the

263
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,119
time, you know, like, I felt
terrible, like, Oh, I'm not good

264
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,640
at this, this is the worst. And
now, I'm just like, well, it's

265
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,059
probably it would have been
worse, if like, everything had

266
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:37,130
gone like great and perfect, you
know. And then just like working

267
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:46,009
in anxiety, and like mental
health struggles, and like, the

268
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:50,480
path to where I am now feels. I
don't know, if you're just

269
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,910
looking at me now. You're like,
Okay, he's got it. Like, he's,

270
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,769
he's got this figured out, he
knows what he's doing. Like,

271
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,779
he's in a career. He's got it
all together. Like that was not

272
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,849
the case at all, you know, which
is another reason why the whole

273
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,670
like, I, my degree is completely
different than what I'm doing

274
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,140
now. And even the specific role
that I'm in right now, the type

275
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,180
of software I'm working, it
wasn't something that I planned

276
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,950
at all. It's just like how
things happen to go. So I felt

277
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,470
like it would be relevant for
people to talk about, you know,

278
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,940
not, not the Twitter experience
of I lost 100 websites in 100

279
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,170
days, and I made $100 million.
Let me tell you, like, No, you

280
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,440
know,

281
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: are you
calling out my Twitter account?

282
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,109
Kirk Shillingford: Have you
launched 100 websites?

283
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,319
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All the
time, that's what I do every

284
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,549
week for fun.

285
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,890
Kirk Shillingford: You know,
and, and I mean, even Virtual

286
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,230
Coffee, like, I feel like the
big appeal of Virtual Coffee is

287
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,700
that like I get to interact with
developers being normal. You

288
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,940
know, as opposed to LinkedIn and
Twitter, like every other place,

289
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,460
like you're, like, we like to,
you're not really allowed to be

290
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,599
normal, right? Like, and even
when we choose to be vulnerable,

291
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,609
like, it's a very specific
choice. And you can do it in

292
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:13,430
very specific ways. But, you
know, if I go there to VC chat,

293
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,710
right, now, I can go to random
and be like, I just ate a bag of

294
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,930
Cheetos and bitched out for
like, two hours. And then it

295
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,319
sounds like, Yeah, man, I love
Cheetos, you know. And that's

296
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,240
like, a normal thing, because we
are normal people. I get very

297
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,700
frustrated with the
conversations around developers

298
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,859
sometimes because I feel that
we're always trying to other

299
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,819
ourselves. And if
unintentionally, ostracizes

300
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,759
parts of the community. You
know, people are always very

301
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,880
quick to identify other
developer brands like this

302
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,430
developer mind is like this. I'm
like, I don't we're not

303
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,900
different than other people,
right? Like we, we have a job we

304
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,799
do. And we're good at it because
we do it. You know, if I didn't

305
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,990
do any coding, I wouldn't be
good at coding. Like I don't get

306
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,890
to like there's no special part
of my brain. It's like, oh, C

307
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,849
sharp, just because I did
cheaper. Yes. So, yeah, sorry,

308
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,319
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was just
gonna say I really like that

309
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,279
idea of the vulnerability that
we see online is still a choice

310
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:19,339
of when people are vulnerable,
right. So that's a point where

311
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,539
somebody, there may have been 10
other points that they haven't

312
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,009
shared, right? And, and when you
have a close community like

313
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:32,329
Virtual Coffee, or you know,
whether it's in a Tuesday,

314
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,019
Thursday coffee, or it's in
Slack, this is a close group of

315
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:41,029
people. And so vulnerability is
definitely more natural for our

316
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:45,470
group of people, which also
allows us to grow, I think, in

317
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,059
ways that if we didn't have that
closeness, that intimacy, we

318
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,109
wouldn't be able to.

319
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:56,059
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah. There's
something about like, the stakes

320
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,920
of like interaction, and how
much energy it takes to have

321
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,589
interactions with people. And
maybe it's different for other

322
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:07,339
people, but I found like, most
social media interactions be

323
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:12,619
very high stakes, in terms of
step it up better be a good

324
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,759
thing. And even if no one else
cares, like, I'm sort of coming

325
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,890
in as a, but I don't, that's
fine. But you can't sort of do

326
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,740
that all the time. And it's good
to have spaces where you can

327
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,500
just, you know, be okay. And
trust other people to just like,

328
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,220
let you be okay, or not. Okay,
you know, yeah, totally.

329
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,700
Dan Ott: One of the Colleen, on
last episode was was talking

330
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,569
about a similar idea, you know,
she was part of other

331
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,720
communities, and, and Twitter
and stuff. And she found that

332
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,380
same thing where you, it's
harder to share any sort of

333
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,049
struggles or anything like that,
and in certain situations, but I

334
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,880
feel, I feel like in Virtual
Coffee, because partly, at least

335
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,240
this is my, is my thing, but
like, because people know, me,

336
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,450
or I know other people, you
know, I have to worry less about

337
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,450
being misinterpreted, or, you
know, I don't know judged or,

338
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,599
or, you know, things like that.
And with Twitter, it's like it's

339
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,670
going out into the world to who
knows, is ever gonna see it,

340
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,259
and, you know, so then I sweat
over every single word, you

341
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,500
know, in a tweet. And therefore,
well, for me a tweet, like once

342
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,700
every three months, or sometimes

343
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,309
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think my
kind of playing off that to the

344
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:35,170
community has made me feel like
I can be more vulnerable in

345
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,069
other spaces. Because there's
this group of people that I have

346
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,400
that I know, support me. And so
that's allowed me to be freer,

347
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,569
and what I say on Twitter or
whatever, so, you know, like,

348
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,569
Oh, I cried at one division last
week, and the week before that,

349
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:54,190
like, I don't know, just stuff
about frustrations and growing

350
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,059
pains and that kind of thing.
When you know that there's a

351
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:01,119
group of people behind you, it's
just easier to do in life in

352
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,140
general, I think.

353
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,799
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah. I
remember, one of the big things

354
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,359
for me, I think, was, well, at
the time, I think we call it the

355
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,589
ADD/ADHD channel. And then it
became like a neurodiverse

356
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:22,480
channel. Mental health as if it
was one of those things, it's

357
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,470
just still in a space, it's very
difficult to talk about in

358
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,680
general, but also in like,
professional settings, and no

359
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,269
one wants to admit it, or be
honest about it. But like, I

360
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:36,700
can't think about my coding
journey without thinking about,

361
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:42,609
there was a time for about nine
months where I just, I really

362
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:47,559
could not do anything. I was
just kind of like completely

363
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,619
immobilized by anxiety and all
this other stuff. And I just had

364
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:56,289
no idea if I would ever work
again. And in that time, this

365
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,579
was a little bit before BC, but
one of the things that did help

366
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:03,339
me like was online communities,
like I couldn't really go

367
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:09,430
anywhere. So like, finding nice
spaces online, like kind spaces

368
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:16,390
online was like my way of like,
solace and recovery. And I

369
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,700
remember there be days of like,
okay, you can't do anything else

370
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,559
today, but you can, like, be
nice to somebody. And, if you

371
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,650
see has like a lot of that
energy, you know, where it's

372
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,089
like, okay, you know, like, my
day has been going really

373
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:31,180
crappy, like work has not been
working out or family trip or

374
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,029
whatever it is, like I can, I
can go on like Virtual Coffee

375
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:37,630
and like, be nice to someone,
you know, like, support them. Or

376
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,490
I just, I feel like the
community is just like, doing

377
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,930
that constantly. Like we're all
just helping each other because

378
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,750
like, it makes us feel good. It
feels good to make other people

379
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,069
feel good. Yeah. And that like
that's like forever energy,

380
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:57,160
right? Like, you can do that
forever. And you know, we can

381
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,059
talk about how like it's almost
it's almost a little You also

382
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,490
have to be a little careful.
Otherwise, you will keep doing

383
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,859
that and not do like anything
else. Because like, it's very

384
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,910
validating. But I do think
that's like a very good thing.

385
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,390
So a lot of times you'll hear
people talk about even the

386
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,849
online space. Now the pandemic,
a lot of people have had to move

387
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,750
to these spaces like us at the
same. I miss real life like this

388
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,910
is all fake. And I'm like, it is
different. And obviously, I do

389
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,019
wish, like things were, how they
used to be. And we could travel

390
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,769
again, and we could have those
like real contacts. But there's,

391
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,369
I think it's fair to say like,
there's the online space is not

392
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,990
it's not real space, it's just a
different space. Right? Like

393
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,640
it's lost, like, physical
connections, but like all the

394
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,910
other connections are still
there. And I've met some of my

395
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,910
most important, most trusted,
most valued most loved people

396
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:58,599
online. So yeah, it's all real,
which is why you shouldn't be

397
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,319
mean on Twitter.

398
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,309
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I want to
jump back a second to the idea

399
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,119
of mistakes. Because I think
that, like there's a couple of

400
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:13,750
different things. I think,
sometimes one people mistake,

401
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,269
mistake mistakes for failure.
But also, I think that there's

402
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,920
an idea that imperfect,
imperfect things are mistakes,

403
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,549
right. And I don't really think
that's true. But I think it took

404
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:34,809
me a little bit to get there.
And so I just want to talk a

405
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:38,230
little bit about your approach
to doing something that's

406
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,500
imperfect or putting something
imperfect out into the world.

407
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,920
Kirk Shillingford: How dare you
put me on the spot like this? Do

408
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,200
you think this is a podcast? No,
no, I'm, I have a complicated

409
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,829
relationship with stuff like
mistakes, because I even though

410
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:01,059
for a long time, I didn't admit
it. I do have a type of

411
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,480
personality who wants to do
something right the first time,

412
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,430
which means I will spend either
way too much time planning, or

413
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,920
way too much time like micro
tweaking. And you know, if I

414
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,349
definitely like, have a my flaw,
I think it's definitely just

415
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:25,420
finish a thing. And then you can
come back later, is not my

416
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,160
natural like instinct. And it
was really funny. I'm gonna say

417
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,329
something very nerdy. Now, as if
the last 100 sentences haven't

418
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:40,450
been very nerdy. But there is
this role playing game called

419
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,650
Neverwinter Nights. It's like a
dungeon dragons game. And I love

420
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,150
this game. I've spent hours
playing this game. I've never

421
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,589
beat this game, not what's, what
I will do is I will spend like,

422
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,750
days thinking of the character,
I'm going to make, like, ah,

423
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,000
they're going to do this. And
then they're going to do this at

424
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,339
this level. And I will do all
that. And then like, I would not

425
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,539
actually do it. I didn't know
why for a long time. And through

426
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:14,619
just like introspection, and,
you know, talking of like,

427
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:18,880
therapists and stuff, if that's
okay, I definitely am terrified

428
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,450
of failure, especially like
catastrophic failure. And I

429
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,569
think like, Okay, I'm going to
do this. If you want to know

430
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:28,779
what's going to hate me, like,
it's all just kind of going to

431
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:34,809
go wrong. And then you just
don't want to do anything,

432
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:37,930
right. Because like, if I don't
do anything, then I can't mess

433
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:43,539
up anything. But that's like a
really, really difficult way to

434
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,779
live life. Like it's very safe,
but it's not very fulfilling,

435
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:56,259
ends up being very frustrating.
So I think when I when I think

436
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:59,680
of mistakes I've made, I don't
think of those moments where

437
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,099
I've done something wrong. I
think of those moments where

438
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:07,539
like, I failed to do something,
even though I could be wrong.

439
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:14,019
Even though I could go wrong.
And kind of like that paralysis

440
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,069
is is a thing that that's my
personal thing, that thing that

441
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:22,150
sort of holds me back a lot. So
like I want to tell people like

442
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,970
all like when I say yeah, I've
been doing development for seven

443
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,180
years, a lot of that has been
not doing development or being

444
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,400
scared to do development being
scared to take certain

445
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,930
positions, because I was worried
that I just wouldn't be able to

446
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,930
handle it. Or I started
something and then like the

447
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,410
pressure of not doing like a
perfect job caused it to go

448
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,299
wrong in the first place. And
that's like a real thing I think

449
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:50,410
happens to a lot of people. So
yeah, just to say, it definitely

450
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,460
also happens to me.

451
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,789
Dan Ott: I love that it's like
and it's an interesting thing

452
00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:00,740
that I don't know, there's
obvious When you're in the

453
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,109
middle of it, you know, if you
haven't, if you haven't framed

454
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:09,740
it that way to yourself, that
sort of, you know, hey, I'm sure

455
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,259
people, I mean, I know that I
have at least I'm just gonna

456
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,750
suffer from personal experience,
you know, have have run into

457
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,859
that, you know, avoiding jumping
into something or committing to

458
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,559
something because of because of
fear, you know, because of fear

459
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,869
of failure, or, for me, it's the
things that come along with

460
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:33,650
failure. So, so for me, it's not
so much being afraid to, you

461
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,299
know, afraid that I won't, like
won't change, trying to think of

462
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,549
a good example, I can't think of
one but like, not that I won't

463
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:43,910
be able to complete the task,
right, but that not completing

464
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:49,130
the task, or completing it in
some way. That is not, you know,

465
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,890
amazing and perfect, will cause
me, you know, embarrassment, or

466
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,950
let people down other things
like that, right, in the

467
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,230
complicated motions that can
come with that. And I just love

468
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,900
that you, Kirk that I mean, I've
learned from you like just

469
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,170
talking about this sort of thing
out loud, you know, I don't

470
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,119
know, it is, it's both, like,
sharing makes other people feel

471
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,880
more comfortable sharing, you
know, but also the way to frame

472
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,880
stuff stuff like this,
sometimes, people don't connect

473
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,160
the dots in their own life, you
know, until until they maybe

474
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,430
hear, hear what other people are
going through. And, you know,

475
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,269
something rings a bell, right?
Which has happened a lot to me

476
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:35,210
in Virtual Coffee, just, you
know, talking to people,

477
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,599
especially, you know, kirkin and
Bekah just kind of over and over

478
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,279
again, you know, so I don't
really have a point other than,

479
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,069
you know, thank you, Kirk for,
for like sharing all that stuff.

480
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,759
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I always
like to say, Kirk is the heart

481
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:59,089
of Virtual Coffee, right? He
allows us the safe space to be

482
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:02,720
vulnerable, when you need
somebody to talk to even if you

483
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,589
think I don't want anybody to
hear what I'm feeling or these

484
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:10,640
words to come out of my mouth.
Like, I always know that, okay,

485
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,339
I can talk to Kirk about this.
And there's something about

486
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:21,500
that, you know, you just you
just have this. give off this,

487
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,460
this vibe word you allow people
to, to come to you in that way.

488
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,539
But also, because of the way
that you share that definitely

489
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,240
creates a space where I'm like,
Okay, well, he shared about

490
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,349
that. Now I can. And I think
that, you know, that's so

491
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:40,250
important to what we're talking
about, too. Like I know, for me,

492
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,960
I also have these fears that
have prevented me from doing

493
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,920
things. And, you know, one of
them was I was just not going to

494
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,940
apply for developer jobs. After
I graduated from Flatiron

495
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,779
School. I was like, I can't do
this. So I will just not do

496
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,500
anything. And my husband's a
developer too. And he was like,

497
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,319
nope, nobody ever feels ready.
So you just have to do it. Okay,

498
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,069
well, well, then I'll put out
this tweet or whatever. But you

499
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:12,019
know what I'm like finding now I
was terrified of that. And in

500
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:16,759
all the times that I've had to
apply for jobs, but now those

501
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,940
fears I can kind of like, are
tied to this feeling of maybe I

502
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,640
won't be dependable, right, I
get really stuck on this idea of

503
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,710
like, you have to be perfect to
be dependable. But just to be

504
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,829
able to hear people talk through
their own experiences and say

505
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:37,339
like, Oh, I didn't know what I
was doing at this point, to talk

506
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:41,420
to new devs now and say like,
okay, like, I felt this exact

507
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,920
fear, or I understand where
you're coming from. And here are

508
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,680
some things that you could think
of, but sometimes the most

509
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,769
important thing is just like
surrounding yourself with, you

510
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:55,039
know, good people, a community
of people like, like, you guys.

511
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,599
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah. I had
like, a bunch of thoughts in my

512
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,700
head, and he'll just like
condense on like, a very

513
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,219
enthusiastic, yes. Yeah, I think
it's, I think it's very, very

514
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:19,510
valuable to have spaces where
you can share without fearing

515
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:24,130
being judged. Right. And I mean,
like VCs, what, like, it doesn't

516
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,849
have that could be anywhere. And
when I think about, like, the

517
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,449
value of therapy or therapy is
this, you know, this person who,

518
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,849
you know, you say whatever to
them, and they're like, Okay,

519
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:35,710
cool. I'll see you next week.
Right? And you don't, you don't

520
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,510
have to kind of hold that. Or
even you know, before it was

521
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,170
like a village elder or your
priest or whoever. But it's

522
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,829
always that same thing, like you
will, you can talk and someone

523
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:53,170
will listen, but like, they're
not going to change the way they

524
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,980
behave towards you at the end,
which I think is just something

525
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:03,010
that's important for people in
general. When I had, like, my

526
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,989
moments, like very intense
trauma and anxiety and PTSD,

527
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:11,409
like the thing I remember the
most was like my, thankfully, I

528
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:16,690
had family who just said, okay,
you know, like they didn't, it

529
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,159
didn't make me feel bad for
feeling bad, you know. And I

530
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,780
didn't know if I was going to be
okay. They didn't know if I was

531
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,960
going to be okay. But they're
like, you know, like, we, we

532
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:33,820
love you regardless. So it's,
you know, if you can, I like the

533
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:40,449
idea of letting people know
that. Okay, whatever you say to

534
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:45,489
me right now, like, I'm not
like, it's not gonna change.

535
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,920
Like, I'm not going to change
things like because of that,

536
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,030
like, I've just, I just want to
listen. And that doesn't mean

537
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,019
like, we're in problem solving
mode, like for now, or just in

538
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,050
listening mode, because that was
what was done for me. And that

539
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,900
was really important for me, and
I don't think I would be here if

540
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,079
someone had done that for me. So
if I can do that, for other

541
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,349
people, that would be nice not
to say, want to be very clear

542
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,690
that I am, like, perfect at
these things I very much

543
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:20,500
nothing. And I, my, there's a
certain community who's also

544
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,889
known me for being like very
reserved, and maybe aloof. And

545
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:29,949
this pandemic has definitely not
been good for, like my type of

546
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:34,030
personality, who already wanted
to be inside a lot, really

547
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,360
inside. So I'm also thankful to
their friends who, like reach

548
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,389
out and be like, Hey, you know,
we should do something? Because

549
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:48,610
we should do something. Yeah,
it's just, I don't know, I feel,

550
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:51,070
I feel like I don't really have
any insights about software,

551
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,380
except functional programming.
Like we can talk about that all

552
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,280
the time, because I love that.
But I feel like everything. The

553
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,820
only difference between me as a
junior developer, as a senior

554
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:09,070
developer is that I have become
a lot more empathetic. And I

555
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,409
have realized, like, how fragile
sort of these things are these

556
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,980
like titles and dispositions,
and all these things we hype

557
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:25,210
ourselves up about, and what's
really important, our you know,

558
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:33,670
our relationships. And trying to
be good at those feels like a as

559
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,579
worthwhile and endeavor as
trying to be good at once,

560
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,099
what's the latest JavaScript
thing? We're into?

561
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:44,230
Something-dot-js...

562
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,110
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and I
want to say too, I think that

563
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,400
those moments where we allow
ourselves to talk through

564
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,059
things, or we're been vulnerable
with other people, that allows

565
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:02,500
us to grow in ways that we can't
otherwise, right, like, I am

566
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,869
very much. I don't know what the
word is right now, I process

567
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,119
things out loud, rather than
thinking them through my head,

568
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,869
right. And so I will go on
tangents that might not make

569
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:16,809
sense to many of the people who
are next to me, but it's just

570
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:19,780
because I'm thinking through
these things. And a lot of times

571
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,030
just having someone there that
can kind of figure out what's

572
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,469
going on in direct my thoughts
that are going all over the

573
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,710
place is enough to get me to
where I need to go to move

574
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,900
forward and to grow a little bit
more. And so for a lot of years,

575
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:41,230
I never did that I was just
very, very much internal. And

576
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,699
just over the last couple of
years, I've started to become

577
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:49,269
aware of how important it is to
make connections and how that

578
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:54,159
allows us to grow in different
ways. And I think that, you

579
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:59,650
know, no matter what you do, the
best version of yourself

580
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,639
includes connecting with other
people in real and meaningful

581
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,059
ways. And that will inform
everything else that you do in

582
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:07,480
life.

583
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,719
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah, I think
it reminds me of a conversation

584
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,880
we had Emerald at this
compensation. beckon you and I

585
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,400
were talking about how you like
the role of trauma in our lives.

586
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,309
Okay, this was a thing that
happened, that was like a bad

587
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:28,570
thing to happen. But sort of the
person that emerged from it is

588
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,590
probably the kind of person
maybe, then we might have

589
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,929
otherwise have been. And I think
that's, that's kind of something

590
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,050
I worry about, or try and pay
attention to sometimes. So, you

591
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,659
know, and I think the industry
is like moving in a better

592
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:48,670
direction. But sometimes I think
about like, when they asked you

593
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,579
Hey, well, there's this like,
eight month period where you

594
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:55,059
didn't work like what happened
then, you know, and I'm not sure

595
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,219
what answer you're supposed to
give, but I I'm pretty sure

596
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,710
you're not supposed to say well,
you know, like my depression got

597
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,260
really bad. And I just didn't do
anything trade, right? Like no

598
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,909
one of all the lip service
companies paid like, like no

599
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:09,909
actually really wants to hear
that. It's it's the Twitter

600
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:14,440
thing all over again. But that
is, I don't know, just that's

601
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,489
real people, right? Like, we do
not have this like happy go

602
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:24,849
lucky path of work to work to
work to cool things cool thing

603
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:30,940
to cool thing or you know, maybe
we shouldn't ask people like why

604
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,130
there's a big dip in there like
GitHub points things like maybe,

605
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,670
you know, maybe that doesn't
matter, right? Like maybe you

606
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,360
should be judging me on like,
what I've done not like, the

607
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,699
spaces between the things that
you think are relevant, you

608
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:51,489
know, I don't know. And, I mean,
the big thing for me was always,

609
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,650
I've always worked with small
companies, I work with a

610
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:03,070
research department at school.
And now I work for like a very,

611
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,659
very small software development
company. So you know, there's a

612
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:12,519
long time where I did not do any
programming. When I left work,

613
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,429
like I came to work to my job.
When I came home, I did not do

614
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:18,670
anything. I just didn't have any
motivation for it. Like, it just

615
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,070
didn't make me happy. And
Virtual Coffee happened at

616
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,309
Hacktoberfest happened and all
of a sudden, like, oh, okay, I'm

617
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:29,199
not just doing this by myself,
like, I'm doing this with other

618
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,070
people. And I get to show other
people things I've learned, and

619
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,469
they're showing me things that
they've learned, and everybody's

620
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:38,380
super appreciative. And
honestly, that was the first

621
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,340
time like, I'd done any side
projects and months.

622
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,460
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Let's, um,
can we just pause for a second

623
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,690
and talk about hack tober Fest,
because I think like that was a

624
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,440
really pivotal moment for me,
especially and learning from

625
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,019
other people and growing. And
actually, in the trailer for the

626
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,289
podcast, there's a quote from
you about community and hack

627
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:07,960
tober fest. And so you did a ton
of work to make sure that the

628
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,010
community was supported through
documentation, and through your

629
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,610
presence and things like that.
And so you really played a major

630
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,489
role in that. Can you just like,
talk a little bit about your

631
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,949
process? And going through that,
because you played a lot of

632
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:22,389
different roles?

633
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,710
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah, I can
get on my soapbox for this,

634
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,550
because this is super important.
So like, I think the big thing

635
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,820
we learned from Hacktoberfest
was, we were all asking this

636
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,760
question of, well, why aren't
more newer developers getting

637
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,489
involved in open source? You
know, there seem to be all this

638
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:45,250
hype about open source. But when
you spoke to people they like,

639
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,889
actually, it still feels very
intimidating. I still don't know

640
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:52,179
what to do. Like, I don't think
I can do this. And I mean, I,

641
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,500
and there's a, there's a big
discussion there. But to me, the

642
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,670
short answer was, Oh, well, we
say that this is open, inviting

643
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:05,889
for new people, but it's
actually not. And it's like,

644
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:09,730
well, why it's like, well,
because like, not enough has

645
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,000
been done to make it welcoming,
right. And I'm not saying that

646
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,489
to chastise the people who
haven't done all the work, it's

647
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,800
just to say that like, it is
actually a lot of work, it is

648
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,110
like, you have to be intentional
about these things, if you

649
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,780
actually want people to work
with you, especially newer

650
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,099
people. And we realize, Oh, it's
actually very difficult if you

651
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:33,880
don't know what to do to like,
clone a repo or get a project

652
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,449
started or do a PR, and you are
super terrified that you're

653
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,699
gonna mess up someone else's
work, and you are completely

654
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:42,820
unsure that what you're doing is
a meaningful contribution. So

655
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,050
you have to come at it from so
many different angles. And then,

656
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,050
you know, I started writing all
that documentation, because

657
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,849
like, I kept finding, like, more
and more like, Okay, this

658
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,010
actually isn't very well
explained to my business and

659
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:58,150
will explain or there's docs for
this, but not that piece. But

660
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,969
there's like a full cycle of
what it takes to like make a

661
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,190
meaningful contribution. And
remember, we had like this big

662
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,159
discussion of, Okay, well, do we
find projects online and

663
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,059
redirect them to people or, and
we ultimately decided, like, it

664
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,809
has to be people from the
community, mainly because like,

665
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:21,280
it's the only way like, we can
be sure that the maintainers

666
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,519
have healthy interactions with
the people who want to help,

667
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,969
which is like the most critical
thing. And then that became a

668
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:29,590
Wait, what about the
maintainers? Like, they also

669
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:35,050
need to be supported to and that
be so you know, and I love that

670
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,840
that project was a lot of work,
but like, the big takeaway for

671
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,340
me was like, Okay, these things
are possible, but it is a lot of

672
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:47,260
work. And I think like the
danger is always that people

673
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:51,130
want to do a good job, but they
are unaware of the amount of

674
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,949
work it's going to take. And
then like they get burnt out and

675
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:57,789
then the people they're trying
to help get frustrated. And it

676
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:03,400
reminds me of one time I
attended this training, it was

677
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,619
some group and they like, Oh, we
want to get back, we want to

678
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,230
help out in the community, we
want to like bring tech.

679
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:13,449
communities and cultures don't
typically have access to it. And

680
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,869
they made this whole program and
they got a bunch of people. And

681
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:20,829
then on the day of it, I
remember, the presenter was

682
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:25,300
using a Mac, being all this
stuff set up and ready to go.

683
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,329
And then one lady was like, I
don't have a Mac, like, how do I

684
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,670
install this on Windows? And
he's like, Oh, I don't really

685
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,289
know, I didn't really think
about that. And I'm like, What

686
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:35,949
do you mean anything about that?
Like, I mean, I get it, but 90%

687
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,409
of the earth uses windows. And I
don't know about anybody else.

688
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,929
But like, when I abandon a
project, it's not like I'm

689
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:46,059
midway through the project. I'm
like, Oh, this isn't for me.

690
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:49,090
It's like, I couldn't install
this, you know, I couldn't get

691
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,670
this file to work. There's an
error. And I don't know what to

692
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,030
do. That's, that's why people
stop things, right? It's always

693
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,119
the config. So it's like, Okay,
well, if you're going to teach

694
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:03,880
anyone, anything, you need to
dedicate time to helping them

695
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,630
get the project set up. And you
have to anticipate at least like

696
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,969
the major base that people will
come up with, you have to meet

697
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:14,619
people where they are like, no
one's going to get a Mac use,

698
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,429
like, Oh, you can get this to
replicate like, No, no, sir. No

699
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:19,659
one's I don't know,

700
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,300
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
kind of tie some of these ideas

701
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,769
together. Like you said, it
takes a lot of time, right. And

702
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:34,000
sometimes you're just not aware
of the needs or the problems

703
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,610
that are gonna show up. And, you
know, that's part of the

704
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,159
learning process. And that's
part of the growing process and

705
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:42,400
thinking through things
deliberately is super important.

706
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:45,639
And is also very, very
challenging. We've got Dan, I

707
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:49,989
know that you set up the issue
for all of our contributors for

708
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:55,539
the Virtual Coffee pr for hack
tober Fest, and thinking through

709
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:57,820
all these things, is pretty
challenging, right?

710
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:02,469
Dan Ott: Yeah. Yeah. And it's, I
mean, Kirk what you said about,

711
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:07,150
you know, people started an open
source project, but didn't think

712
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,659
through all the writing of the
documentation you have to do,

713
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:15,099
and it is hard, it's, I mean,
it, I don't think you're gonna

714
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,219
find anybody that's, that will
argue with that. It's, it's a

715
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:22,329
hard thing with, with anything,
I mean, and it's a completely

716
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:28,659
different mindset than encoding.
And, and that's, I mean, just

717
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:34,929
just, like another reason why we
we wanted to, we decided to work

718
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:37,150
with just a few, you know,
maintainers, that we that we

719
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,699
knew, because we were going to
require them to put a bunch of

720
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:45,849
work in ahead of time to get
their, you know, repositories

721
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:49,420
ready. And yeah, so I mean, I
made that one of the

722
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,760
repositories was our Virtual
Coffee site, and I had an idea

723
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,059
to kick our event off with, you
know, just a very simple, like,

724
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:03,130
pull request thing to, you know,
without a lot of coding, but

725
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,860
that everybody could do, you
know, serve together an event,

726
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,579
and it seemed easy in my head,
you know, and there's just so

727
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:16,179
many things, you have to get
down on paper, to make sure that

728
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:21,579
everybody is sort of covered,
like he said, it's like the, the

729
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,679
windows thing, I mean, like, you
know, different operating

730
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:26,889
systems, it's, you just have to
do tests, almost like, I mean,

731
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,079
you know, automated tests for
like, browser tests, or

732
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,210
something, you know, like, in
front end, right. So I put out

733
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,820
some code and then, after work
on it for a while, I have to go

734
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,050
and check that it works in
Safari in works in Firefox and

735
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,389
Chrome, you know, it's it, but
when you're writing

736
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:42,309
documentation, that sort of
thing is harder to just like,

737
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,980
check, right? And so, you front
load a bunch of work, and then

738
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,130
hope that it's good enough, and
then hope that you're, you know,

739
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,909
contributors, let you know, when
it's not good enough, either

740
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:57,849
just by asking questions, or, or
submitting pull requests, you

741
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:03,760
know, with documentation fixes,
things like that. Which, I mean,

742
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,969
I mean, Kirk, I don't know how
many hours he spent in the

743
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:10,480
September, you know, preparing
for Hacktoberfest just writing

744
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,619
open source docs, both for us to
use as like templates, and, you

745
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,440
know, specific projects, and
also, you were maintainer for

746
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,079
your own project that was, you
know, heavily involved with

747
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,349
Hacktoberfest, but like, how
much how much time do you think

748
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:25,794
he spent in September writing
docs for? Like for

749
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:28,239
Hacktoberfest?

750
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,820
Kirk Shillingford: Way too much,
but that's the thing, right?

751
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:37,539
It's, it was definitely a lot of
work. But at the time, it didn't

752
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,130
feel like I didn't feel bad
doing the work, right? Because

753
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,039
it felt like okay, this is
meaningful. And this is going to

754
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,400
help people and was also helping
me because it's things I want to

755
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,510
learn about. And, I mean, one of
the things I do like about

756
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:57,909
Virtual Coffee is what you said,
like, the stuff we're doing for

757
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:04,269
the community. It's not
strangers, you know, so totally,

758
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,889
there's a little less pressure
to, like, get it absolutely

759
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:12,789
perfect the first time. And I
have a little more trust that

760
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:20,710
people will, like suggest things
to help. like to say, there's a

761
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,059
lot in my head, it's gone.
Right? Yep. It's like all this

762
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:28,750
stuff comes down to, whenever
you try and do something like

763
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,320
this, you are trying to empower
people, right? You're trying to

764
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,940
give people everything they need
to, to do the thing that they

765
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,690
want. But it's like, okay, you
have to think of the people that

766
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,900
you're serving. But you also
have to think of yourself, like,

767
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,280
it also has to be designed in a
way that you can keep empowering

768
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:55,269
them. Because otherwise, and not
pointing fingers, and pointing

769
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:59,920
fingers at all of us, you get
into this space where you're

770
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,300
doing this stuff, but it's also
like taking a toll on you like

771
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,900
it's just as a scribe it like
you should also be empowering

772
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,480
yourself. I remember another PC
member, the very, very wonderful

773
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,840
Nick Taylor. You know, we were
just like pairing up working on

774
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,599
something because Nick is
amazing. And he was like, hey,

775
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,610
do you want to, like, go live on
this? Like, I mean, yeah, sure.

776
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:31,150
And guess what, like he, he had
a setup already, that made it

777
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,829
very easy for him to like,
quickly get up and running.

778
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:39,670
Right, which took off the
pressure for me, because I

779
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,889
didn't have to do a bunch of
prep, that also took off the

780
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:44,710
pressure for him, because he
didn't have to, like spend a

781
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:48,909
bunch of cycles on setup. So it
became easy for him to help

782
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:52,420
people and like parent that way.
And I was like, okay, that,

783
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:59,110
that's neat. That's a good thing
to do. And, you know, Virtual

784
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,630
Coffee, like we've been trying
to get into that direction,

785
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,079
where it's like, it's easy when
someone wants to do something

786
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,380
that we can, like, help them in
a way that's also sustainable

787
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,579
for us. But again, like that
means you have to you do have to

788
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:18,880
Front Load a lot of trek to get
to that space. And it isn't a

789
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,280
bunch of things like we want to
do and the people like oh, yeah,

790
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:26,079
we, I mean, we want to do
everything. But whatever we do

791
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,559
in order to not be like other
experiences that have been

792
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,159
frustrating or disappointing. We
have we take the time to think

793
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,340
like, okay, either we can set
this up in a way that like,

794
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:41,170
people are empowered, and we're
empowered. Or we might have to

795
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,030
hold off on this until we can,
you know,

796
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:49,119
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah, and I
think that idea of things that

797
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:56,079
look easy, usually have a ton of
time put in that you don't know.

798
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,710
So if there's a developer and
you're watching them code, and

799
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,500
it looks so easy, right? It's
because they've done it before,

800
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:05,619
or, you know, it's trying to
explain to my six year old who

801
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:09,010
was watching a painting
tutorial, and he just couldn't

802
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,550
get it, like, the girl was
painting the turkey in the

803
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,429
video, right? Like, you know,
she didn't, this is not the

804
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:17,889
first time she's painted a
turkey, right, she's probably

805
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:21,280
practiced this a bunch of times
before, and then recorded this

806
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,579
video and maybe edited this
video, you know, but if

807
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:26,920
something goes smoothly, that's
because there's been a lot of

808
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:31,510
deliberate thought and effort
put in to make sure that that

809
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:35,650
happens. And so, you know,
everybody starts from a very

810
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:40,630
imperfect place. It's just the
practice and the time put in

811
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,679
that takes you to get to that
place where it looks easy, but

812
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,409
nothing, nothing is just easy,
right?

813
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,710
Kirk Shillingford: Bringing it
back to our theme of mistakes

814
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:56,199
when you are working with
someone, and, you know, you see

815
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,630
them like solve a problem that
you've been spending forever on.

816
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,989
It's not because they're a
genius. I mean, they might be

817
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,699
genius. But that's not why we
solve it like this, because

818
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,250
like, they solve that problem
before, right? Like, this has

819
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,989
already happened to them, or
something similar. And they're

820
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:15,670
working off of that mistake, or
that frustration that they had

821
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,199
back then to kind of avoid it
now. And like steer you away

822
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:26,980
from that path, right. Now, and
that's that's just like that to

823
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,199
me, like, oh, what's a senior
developer or someone who's I

824
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,539
think someone said, Maybe this
is from someone who's made a lot

825
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:34,809
of mistakes already. You know,
when you're new, you haven't

826
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:38,530
made that many mistakes yet. But
then this gets right back to

827
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,840
providing opportunities. You
need to provide opportunities

828
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,619
for people to make mistakes. I
don't think there's anyone who's

829
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:49,780
been in code for more than five
years at some point, like wasn't

830
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:54,280
given the chance to do something
that they were probably not

831
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,579
qualified to do or not exactly
ready to do like someone gave

832
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:01,659
you a chance and you kind of
have to pass that forward, you

833
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:04,809
know, otherwise you're being I
feel like a little disingenuous

834
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,099
about how this process works.

835
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,710
Dan Ott: Yeah. And you mentioned
and it actually, you were

836
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,210
talking about the senior
developer distinction. Like a

837
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,760
while, like, near the beginning
of your talk, but you mentioned

838
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,920
empathy, you know, as as, like,
one of the indicators, right,

839
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,929
but of a senior developer, and I
think that's, I think it's

840
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:31,320
really important to keep in
mind, the, one of the things

841
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,360
that I've learned over the last,
like, however long with Virtual

842
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,099
Coffee, specifically is, you
know, like, leaning on the

843
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:45,809
empathy to remember that
something is easy for me,

844
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,320
because I have done it a bunch
of times, and, you know, when

845
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,690
you practice anything,
eventually becomes second

846
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,900
nature. And then you kind of
forget, can forget what it was,

847
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,960
like, you know, to learn it in
the first place. I think that's

848
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,179
true with anything, really, but
it's especially true with

849
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:03,809
coding, because coding happens
so fast. And lots of times, you

850
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:08,820
know, people learn in all
different ways, you know, across

851
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:12,420
different ages and different,
you know, time spans, I learned

852
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,860
how to code over, I don't know,
five or 10 years, you know, here

853
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,019
and there, you know, it wasn't
like, I wasn't trying to do it

854
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:21,599
in six months, or whatever, you
know, because I was trying to

855
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,269
switch careers. I didn't even I
even think I said the word

856
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:30,329
career out loud. Until I was
like, 30, you know, like, but

857
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:33,780
just like circling back, I mean,
I, you're the, you're framing

858
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,230
around empathy as as a as a key
indicator of, you know, being as

859
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,769
a senior developer, I think is
very good. And been, very

860
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:46,559
important, and I appreciate you
like talking about it. With us.

861
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,210
Kirk Shillingford: Yeah. And I
think I think everyone here, at

862
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,269
least everyone that I know, in
the coding space is pretty much

863
00:56:54,269 --> 00:56:57,869
in agreement, right? The 10 x
engineers thought the person

864
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,420
hate that phrase, but you know,
it's not the person who can

865
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,809
like, work 10 times faster than
other people. It's the person

866
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,510
who makes 10 other people around
them, like better at the job,

867
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,170
right? Like, what do you think
of that's, you know, and then

868
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,360
you realize that that role is a
supporting role, right, it's a

869
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,019
management role, it's a
mentoring role, you know, find

870
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,210
me that person, find me the
person where I can put them on a

871
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,909
team. And all of a sudden,
everybody else on the team is

872
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:26,969
like, feeling better, right,
that person is doing way more

873
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:31,050
for the organization than
someone who's, I don't know,

874
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,929
sitting at his desk or at their
desk, you know, just not

875
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:40,050
interacting with with others.
And I mean, but that's not even

876
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,599
something I talked too much
about anymore. Because at least

877
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,389
again, I don't think there's
anybody in the spaces that I'm

878
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:51,420
in, who still holds on to that
idea of being a good developer

879
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:55,590
means like, knowing lots of
things or being able to type

880
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,809
really, really fast or whatever.
And it's been really heartening

881
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:04,199
to see. Even the people in BC
who've been like job hunting,

882
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,690
looking for interviews, everyone
has a pretty much at a certain

883
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,090
point in everyone's career,
like, you hear the same phrases

884
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,639
being echoed, like I just want
to work with my people, you

885
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:16,230
know, I just want to do work
that's meaningful. I want to

886
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,829
have like a healthy balance of
like, my family life and my

887
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:25,650
professional responsibilities. I
want to give back and mentor

888
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,949
people who were in the space and
I want to, like receive support

889
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:31,139
from people who are more senior
in this space, like everyone

890
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:37,650
says the same thing, you know,
so I, that just, it feels like a

891
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,039
natural space to be and it feels
like the space that we're going,

892
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:49,440
and if I can contribute to that,
that is awesome. There was a

893
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,860
discussion, I think, yesterday,
the day before about passion on

894
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,300
Twitter. And that that was it
was really interesting seeing

895
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,309
everybody's responses, and some
people like hate, you know,

896
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:03,840
like, I'm here to I'm doing this
as a family, you know, or, I'm

897
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,610
doing this or something like I'm
doing this because I really like

898
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,380
it and like both, both of those
things are valid. No. I'm not so

899
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,340
concerned with your motivations
for being in the space as much

900
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,150
as your actions while you're
here, you know? And if you're

901
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,949
not being a jerk, and you know,
I feel like

902
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,570
if you are being a jerk, then
cool, like, we can't be friends.

903
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,139
Because you're gonna be a jerk
to my other friends.

904
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:37,710
Dan Ott: Okay, I like it. No,
yeah, no jerk friends.

905
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:39,750
Kirk Shillingford: No jerk
friends,

906
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,880
Dan Ott: I have to call some of
my old friends let them know I

907
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,840
can't be friends with them
anymore.

908
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:54,539
Kirk Shillingford: And I say I
I'm trying very hard to sort of

909
00:59:54,570 --> 01:00:00,900
be clear in all this that I am
very much making lots mistakes.

910
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,139
And in a lot of ways, I am a
very big hypocrite about all

911
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:07,860
these things. There's very much
areas of code that like, I

912
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:11,579
really want to be good at, like
I, part of my motivations, like,

913
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,369
I want to be good at this thing.
I would like to be knowledgeable

914
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:18,150
about this thing and smarter
about this thing. I want to be

915
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,239
like, you know, I don't know.
And that's just like a personal

916
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:26,670
goal. As you all know, and
anyone who's spoken to me for

917
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30,150
more than five seconds is aware,
I'm a big fan of like, certain

918
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:35,610
styles of programming. And I try
really hard to be good at those

919
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:40,590
things. Last night, students
work on the newsletter. And then

920
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,880
I was just like, reading, like,
functional TypeScript stuff.

921
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,659
Because that's fun for me. And I
like that. But you know, even

922
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:56,550
that, I've read like the same
articles, like eight or 10

923
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:00,210
times, just trying to grok some
of these things. And like, it

924
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:03,119
still hasn't worked yet. You
know. And that's super

925
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,730
frustrating. And it makes me
very angry. And I feel like an

926
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:11,250
idiot. But when I said earlier
that, you know, I don't think I

927
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,070
really have an aptitude for
programming, someone who's like,

928
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,699
I just don't mind doing it.
Like, I just, I don't mind

929
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:20,400
writing code, like, I can do it.
And I don't mind being

930
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,090
frustrated about it. And I'll
keep coming back to it. And if

931
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,030
you do that for long enough, I
guess, you know, you get good at

932
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,929
programming, you know, but I
really want to dispel the notion

933
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:36,090
that people think like, Okay, I
need to, I need to get this. You

934
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,139
know, I don't think that's how
software works at all, like, you

935
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:43,769
try and do it. And then you keep
doing it. And then you start to

936
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:48,599
get things. But if you feel
like, Oh, this is just not

937
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,860
intuitive for me, I don't think
it's intuitive for anyone. And

938
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,670
for the people it is intuitive
for I don't care if not like a

939
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:00,000
nice person, I'm still not gonna
want to work with that, you

940
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,690
know, give me somebody who finds
this stuff is really hard, but

941
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,969
like they're earnest, and they
want to learn and they're a good

942
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:11,969
teammate over a mobile like, you
know?

943
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:16,110
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure. I mean, I think that is a

944
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,659
great way to sum up everything
that you've been talking about,

945
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:21,929
right? It's about growing
through our mistakes, and about

946
01:02:21,929 --> 01:02:24,179
being kind to the people around
us. And that supportive

947
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:27,690
environment is what allows
everybody to grow. Right. So

948
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,889
it's community growth. And I
want to thank you for being here

949
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:37,469
with us today. Kirk, this was
such a fantastic interview, we

950
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:41,010
heard so many good thoughts
about programming and learning

951
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:46,530
and growing, and I'm very, very
excited to share this. where can

952
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,519
our listeners find you?

953
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,440
Kirk Shillingford: You can find
me at Virtual Coffee, you should

954
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,400
should come hang out with us at
Virtual Coffee. I'm also on

955
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,280
Twitter at @KirkCodes, where
sometimes I say smart things.

956
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:09,780
And most of the time I just make
memes. Where else? I guess those

957
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,619
are, those are sort of the main
spaces, I think VC, VC and

958
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:19,710
Twitter. Oh, I mean, I guess my
GitHub, in case show if you for

959
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,110
anyone listening, if you ever
want to talk about functional

960
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,309
programming, or dive into
languages like Elm or you just

961
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:31,710
want to hear some strange man
from the Caribbean talk too much

962
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:38,760
about it. We can we can totally
get into that. Yeah, thank you.

963
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:43,409
Thank you for for having me. I
will say in a very, very

964
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:49,079
fundamental way, becoming best
friends. Yeah. Best friends with

965
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,789
Bekah and Dan has been one of
the best parts of the last year

966
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:54,300
for me.

967
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:55,469
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I'm buying
BFF necklaces

968
01:03:57,269 --> 01:04:02,130
Kirk Shillingford: If you can
get the full necklace bracelet,

969
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:06,360
you can do the whole thing.
Yeah. So you know, and I think

970
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,800
that's that's ultimately it,
right? Like, it's so much easier

971
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:16,260
to work with people that you
appreciate and appreciate you

972
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:22,409
back. And if we could do more of
that, then I think we have a

973
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:24,329
good chance of doing some cool
stuff.

974
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,874
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All right.
Well, I'll talk to you soon.

975
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:29,448
Bye.
