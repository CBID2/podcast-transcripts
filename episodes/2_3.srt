00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,129
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season two, Episode

2
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,989
Three of the Virtual Coffee
podcast.

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,379
I'm Bekah, and this is a podcast
that features members of the

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,129
Virtual Coffee community.
Virtual Coffee is an intimate

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,980
group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,590
And they're here on this podcast
sharing their stories and what

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,460
they've learned. And we're here
to share it with you. Here with

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,590
me today is my co host, Dan.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,920
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Joining
us today is Glen McCallum, a

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,219
software engineer from Victoria,
Canada. Glen does back end

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,549
development in C sharp and SQL
while managing a team of eight

12
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,119
engineers for the second largest
independent book distributor in

13
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,359
the United States. I really
enjoyed our conversation with

14
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,990
Glen. We talked about his career
journey, some hard decisions

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,620
he's had to make along the way,
and the unexpected ways that

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,030
Tech has entered his life.

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,849
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

18
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:12,489
like we start every Virtual
Coffee, we introduce ourselves

19
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,569
with our name, where we're from
what we do, and a random check

20
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:21,400
in question. Today's question
is, you have your own late night

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,120
talk show. Who do you invite as
your first guest? We hope you

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:39,159
enjoyed this episode. Hey, I'm
Bekah, I'm from a small

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:45,280
town in Ohio. I am a front end
developer. And if I had my own

24
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:49,870
late night talk show, I think my
first guest would be Mindy

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,109
Kaling because she does lots of
different stuff. She's super

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,209
smart and funny. And I think she
would be fantastic to talk to.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,920
Dan Ott: Yeah, she's really
cool. That this is really hard,

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,730
because there's just so many,
you know, like, potentials. By

29
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,860
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Dan. From
Lakewood, Ohio. I do fronted

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,520
development. And if I had a late
night talk show, my first guess

31
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,939
I'm just gonna go with recency
bias. We most watching a lot of

32
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,270
Brooklyn nine nine and Terry
Crews is just like one of my

33
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,610
favorite people. And he's, he
seems very, very cool and

34
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,530
interesting. Like in the real
world, too. So that's, that's

35
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,819
who I would have as my guest.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,110
Glen McCallum: Hi, I'm Glen
McCallum. I live in Victoria,

37
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,689
Canada. I'm still learning
software development. But I have

38
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,150
my own team, I manage a team of
software developers.

39
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,520
If I had my own talk show, my
knee jerk answer to this one was

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,750
Mr. Rogers. I have such a
special place in my heart for

41
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,349
him. But at the same time, I
didn't want to have like the

42
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,250
awkwardness of a stranger. I
really got to meet someone. I

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,870
wanted someone other than a
stranger though.

44
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,710
So the name I'm going to put out
there as a name you've never

45
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,210
heard of is Robert C. Gay. And
it's someone I met by chance he

46
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,379
does private equity investment,
and dropped it all to do service

47
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,039
and charity work in Western
Africa, and had this chance

48
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,680
meeting with him and heard him
speak. It was absolutely

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,879
riveting. So I'd want to talk to
him for another full hour if I

50
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,180
could.

51
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,449
Dan Ott: That's, that's awesome.
Yeah, I like I started going

52
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,199
down the road of like, actually
interesting people, but that

53
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,389
might not make a good TV
commercial, you know. And then

54
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,659
like, I don't, I got very
confused, so I just like kept it

55
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:42,069
to celebrities. But this is
another thing I could do a whole

56
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,699
hour long episode just about
some of these questions.

57
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,610
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That would
be fun. Glen, thanks so much for

58
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,789
being here. We are very, very
happy to have you today on the

59
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:00,009
podcast. So thanks for agreeing.
We always like to get started

60
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:05,650
with the origin story, where you
came from and how you got to

61
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,909
where you are. So just the the
short version of how did you get

62
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,689
into tech?

63
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,139
Glen McCallum: Well, originally,
and this goes way back, I, I

64
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,319
wanted to be a large animal
veterinarian. And I went through

65
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,920
pre veterinary in school and I
didn't get into veterinary

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,980
school and there's only one
veterinary school in Western

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,600
Canada. And they get like 200
applicants and accept 20

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,449
positions. And so I was ranked
low 30s as I remember. So it

69
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,129
wasn't mean it wasn't too
discouraging from that

70
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,959
standpoint. But you know, when
you're, when you're at that age,

71
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,240
you just feel like you need to
keep moving on with life. And so

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,620
I had taken a computer science
elective course I taken two of

73
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,339
them Just because I thought you
can't go wrong with some

74
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:10,930
computer science. And I took, I
didn't take like the computer

75
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,120
science for non computer science
people, I wanted to take real

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,500
computer science. So I took the
year one programming courses.

77
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,139
And I got a pluses in both of
them.

78
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,889
And this school sent me a letter
asking me if I wanted to join

79
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,500
the computer science program.
And so it all kind of happened

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,699
at the same time that I got this
one rejection letter from, from

81
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,170
Veterinary College, and got this
invitation letter to study

82
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,300
computer science. And I was
like, Alright, let's do this.

83
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,050
And so that was a transition
moment. And that's kind of what

84
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,300
got me started on this pathway.

85
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,519
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That is
awesome. And well, you've been

86
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,279
coming to Virtual Coffee for a
while to do you remember how you

87
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,689
found out about Virtual Coffee?

88
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:16,579
Glen McCallum: Yeah, absolutely.
I guess I have to credit it back

89
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:23,839
to Jesse. Because I heard Jesse,
on a podcast months before

90
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:28,250
pandemic. And this interesting
thing came out is called moms

91
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:34,069
who code which just sounded
fascinating to me. Because I

92
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:37,339
mean that that notion where I
mean, your family still comes

93
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,759
before code, but you still have
that.

94
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,810
That career integrated, just, I
mean, secretly, I want to be a

95
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,500
mom who codes really. And so I
started following some moms who

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,129
code stuff on Twitter. And from
that came this Virtual Coffee.

97
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,180
And when it first came up, I
thought it was for moms who

98
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,709
code. And initially, I thought,
that would be really cool to

99
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,410
meet some people. But I didn't
come because I thought it was

100
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,360
for the moms. And later on, I
started seeing, you know,

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,800
retweets or lights just popping
up in my stream from, from guys

102
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,040
who are going to Virtual Coffee.
And that's when I decided to

103
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,120
join for the first time in
August.

104
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,230
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I had no
idea. That's the first time I've

105
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,730
ever heard that story. So Jessie
is my husband, who's also a

106
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,610
developer, and moms who code I
was really involved in that

107
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,310
early on. Well, I was learning
and getting into tech, that's

108
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,480
just very, very fascinating. Um,
there are lots of moms that do

109
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,509
come and it's nice. A lot of
them bring their kids. And so we

110
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:57,350
get to see kids and cats and all
the fun people that that come to

111
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,750
Virtual Coffee. So very glad
that you're here. And you can

112
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,500
hang out with the moms.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,750
Glen McCallum: Yeah, it was
really, it was really

114
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,660
interesting. I've been looking
for better friends, is that a

115
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,939
way to say it? I love this
phrase, it's been attributed to

116
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,920
different people, you are the
average of your five closest

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,540
friends. And so, you know, I'd
been looking for some better

118
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,079
five closest friends to hang out
with, and just not quite sure

119
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,330
how to find them. And so after
my, I mean, I came to Virtual

120
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,059
Coffee, it was good. And I
remember sitting here

121
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,179
afterwards, that initial
session, and I just felt sort of

122
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:52,429
empty inside. And it wasn't me
it wasn't that

123
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:55,879
I realized what I was missing.
until after I kind of

124
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:59,120
experienced it in that
professional connection, that

125
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,429
professional camaraderie with
excellent people. And I've been

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,429
coming regularly ever since.

127
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,019
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That is
really awesome. And I think that

128
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,740
resonates with so many people.
And I think you know, having

129
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,070
community has been super
important in the last year, but

130
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,539
also this community has been one
of my favorite places ever for

131
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,889
people because I have a hard
time making friends or talking

132
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:27,710
to people because I can be
really shy and just having a

133
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,769
group of people that I have felt
comfortable around has been such

134
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,000
a great part of not just the
last year but my adult life.

135
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,789
Glen McCallum: I think there's
something very atypical about

136
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,600
this technical group. And I'm
sure it's come out and everybody

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,080
says it, it's just there's
there's no ego and nobody's

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,169
judging or nobody's trying to
prove themselves and so often I

139
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,840
don't care what community like
Stack Exchange, it just seems

140
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,649
like the insecurity comes out.
And that's manifested in

141
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,279
snarkiness. And, and put downs
and things like that, but this

142
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,519
is just really safe and
supportive. Welcoming.

143
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,700
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's nice to
hear. Yeah, I, I'm not sure what

144
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,129
your work situation was before
pandemic, but I've been like,

145
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:27,080
pretty much remote for my whole
career, you know, you know, and

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,710
I come and go from, I don't
know, searching for communities,

147
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,320
you know, I was part of like, a
meetup group early on that, like

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,519
a physical Meetup group. And
then we moved in, I don't know,

149
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,399
it sort of fell apart. And then,
you know, there's, it's just so

150
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,090
hard to find people to, like, be
with, like, when you don't know

151
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,950
how to, like, you know, go into
an office with people for

152
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,320
people, you know, stuff like
that. And, I don't know, it's,

153
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:57,710
it's, that's, that's kind of
felt to you, like, it's just

154
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,429
been so nice to like, this
group, you know, this group

155
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,860
doesn't have the like that some
of those problems, you know, and

156
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,519
so it's just, it's my kind of
group to, you know, where I can

157
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,320
just be comfortable and like, be
myself, you know, and not have

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,409
to worry about the upvotes, or
the popularity contests or

159
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,169
whatever, you run into lots of
other places.

160
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,279
Glen McCallum: I think the the
face to face interaction,

161
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,409
augmenting the online
discussion, group interaction

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,269
just changes the whole dynamic
to get to get to know these

163
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:32,659
people.

164
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,220
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
there's something really, that

165
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,700
invites vulnerability and
intimacy, when you do have that

166
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,269
experience, like you're, you're
seeing them, you're hearing

167
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,620
their voices, once or twice a
week, and I loved how you said

168
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,340
it in one of the breakout rooms
on a Thursday session where you

169
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,649
were talking about, like, if
this is like sitting around a

170
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,450
coffee table, as friends, just
talking, and that's just what it

171
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,600
feels like when when you're in
the room with the people.

172
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,070
Okay, so you your career,
obviously, it's been quite a

173
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,059
journey. So not only were you
going to be a vet, but you made

174
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,840
a lot of like big career
transitions. And I want to know,

175
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,399
there had to be some challenges
along the way that I want to

176
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,809
hear you kind of talk about and
in, I'd love to know how you

177
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,409
felt as you were going through
the challenge. And then now

178
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,409
looking back at that challenge,
in retrospect, like how that's

179
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:33,679
changed, because, like, so much
of the time, when you're in the

180
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,269
middle of that thing, it feels
unbearable. And then once you

181
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,139
get out of it, there's you can
kind of look at it a little bit

182
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:46,159
more objectively. So do you have
any big moments to talk about?

183
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,029
Glen McCallum: We could talk
about lots of moments. I mean, I

184
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,330
kind of spent my first seven
years in enterprise healthcare

185
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,000
IT. And there are some big, big
transitions in that. My second

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
seven years were spent in more
tech software development

187
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,730
straight up. And there was a big
transition to shift between

188
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,629
those but let's go back kind of,
while I'm still in enterprise,

189
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:20,090
healthcare IT and I'm an Oracle,
because that was a things went

190
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,529
pretty smooth. Up until then, I
mean, you you graduate computer

191
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,289
science, I was in the co op
program. So I already had work

192
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,309
experience. I had a job offer
before I finished school. And

193
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,830
things just kind of start
trucking along when you're on

194
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:41,120
that kind of traditional track,
which is nice. However, and and

195
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:47,240
I went to a big integrated
healthcare network and did some

196
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,929
big type of government work,
which is really boring, but

197
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,750
we'll continue on. And I got
recruited to Oracle to work on

198
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,220
their enterprise healthcare
analytics platform, and got into

199
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,440
that world of traveling. We had
a dev team in India, in addition

200
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,769
to California, so there was
like, people working on these

201
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:16,279
products 24 hours a day, I would
essentially get up, have

202
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,850
meetings to transition work back
to me, I do my work all day.

203
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:24,379
Well, my counterpart, slept. And
then at the end of the day, I

204
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,610
would hand my work off to him
and he would do it. Lots of

205
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,889
travel to meet with customers.
But you know, over time, it

206
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:46,309
really took a toll on the
family. And I can remember, you

207
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:50,120
know, coming home to the
airport, my wife picking me up

208
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,659
and like, just like breaking
down and crying on the way home

209
00:14:53,929 --> 00:15:01,070
really hard on the family. I can
remember my second child I would

210
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,929
hug the computer and be like,
goodnight, Daddy because I would

211
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:18,740
talk to them on Skype. And as
well as I wasn't liking the

212
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,399
person I was becoming in terms
of kind of that environment of

213
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,549
traveling eating nice
restaurants, you start to lease,

214
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,039
I started to get a certain
expectation of how things should

215
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,379
be. And when they weren't that
way, I just wasn't very nice.

216
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:40,129
So the I was at Oracle for a
couple years, it was actually

217
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:48,860
the day my third child was born,
that I decided I was leaving.

218
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:57,889
And there's a not sure where
they call it law or program in

219
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,059
Canada, where you can go on
employment benefits at the birth

220
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:07,789
of a child, regardless of
paternity, maternity. And so I

221
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:15,049
registered for that program. And
he gave me a year of minimal

222
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:24,289
income. And, and left Oracle.
And that was a major shift for

223
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:32,149
me, because I really didn't know
where I was going at that point.

224
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:35,600
Towards the end of that year,
off, and I did, I did various

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,929
things on the year off that we
could talk about if you want, I

226
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,159
finished building our house, and
landscaped our yard,

227
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,919
Dan Ott: I was just gonna ask if
you took the whole year, that's

228
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,309
awesome.

229
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,309
Glen McCallum: It gets really
boring if you're just sitting

230
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:50,029
around, although, yeah, there
were some complications from

231
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,399
that birth. So I was really glad
that I was there and available.

232
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,769
Towards the end of that year, I
tried to get into some

233
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:05,059
consulting work. But I found
that my contacts and experience

234
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:14,690
took me into a enterprise type
consulting world, which number

235
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:22,250
one, was leading back to travel.
Number two, it's really hard to

236
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,880
financially weather, the cycles
of enterprise consulting

237
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,700
payment. And maybe you've tried
that maybe you haven't, it takes

238
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:36,230
from the time you have an
agreement, it takes a month to

239
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,980
get legal review on the
contract. After the contract

240
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,730
gives legal

241
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:49,910
review, it takes a month to get
a billing number set up. And,

242
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:53,059
and so that's like, two months
from actually getting a deal

243
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:58,700
hammered out before you can
start billing. And then there's,

244
00:17:53,059 --> 00:18:00,920
you know, submitting the invoice
and just kind of waiting

245
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,630
indefinitely for payment to
come. So it was in having been

246
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:12,920
at kind of the tail end of a
year of, of time off. It wasn't

247
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:17,779
very comfortable to financially
weather that. So I I ran back to

248
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:23,450
the hospital where I worked
before, and got a position

249
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:28,279
there, which is very senior, but
it was an interesting time there

250
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:36,170
time to change there as well.
And I was back there for another

251
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:41,059
year. And they were in the
process of negotiating a big

252
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:45,650
vendor agreement, 100 $50
million contract for consulting

253
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:50,539
and software services to roll
out across the whole Health

254
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:56,660
Network. And when that got
signed, I just didn't feel there

255
00:18:50,539 --> 00:19:03,019
was a place for me there.
Because those those types of

256
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:08,750
services that I could offer
would be just come through that

257
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:12,140
consulting agreement. And I was
just feeling bored.

258
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,170
And so I had a friend at a sort
of an established startup in

259
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:28,849
Victoria. And I had seen
postings for that company come

260
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:33,529
up regularly. When I was
cruising around, and I just

261
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,329
asked him if he was happy there.
And he said, Yeah, they treat me

262
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:46,490
pretty well and so I I he put me
in contact with his boss who I

263
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,599
also loosely knew we had lunch
and it was a done deal. And

264
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,569
that's what got me kind of back
onto the software development

265
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,630
track from the enterprise
healthcare IT track

266
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,328
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
wild. And I think I mean, you

267
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,449
talk about this also commonly,
but those all seem like really

268
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:11,189
huge decisions to make. Were you
ever freaked out about those

269
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,219
decisions? You had a kid? And
your third kid, I think you

270
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:17,878
said, and then you're like,
Well, I'm not gonna do this

271
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:21,058
anymore, right? I don't think I
can handle the birth of a child

272
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:22,679
and leaving a job at the same
time.

273
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,829
Glen McCallum: Yeah now that you
point it out...

274
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:39,710
I always had something that I,
that was there for me. I didn't

275
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,240
drop in leave into nothing. So I
had a, I had a runway and I had

276
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,710
to set a context when I left
Oracle. And I didn't leave the

277
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,680
hospital the second time until I
had another job in place. Yeah,

278
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,369
so it wasn't like I was just
taking the leap of faith.

279
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,059
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I know, I
totally get that it just

280
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,769
transitions like that can be so
difficult. And so for me, it

281
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,509
would be it would require a long
stretch of second guessing

282
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:18,200
myself as to whether or not that
was a good decision.

283
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,460
Glen McCallum: And it wasn't.
without emotion, I'll say that,

284
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:28,009
especially ... transitioned back
into software development. As I

285
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:34,940
joined a team that was that is
was also...what's the

286
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:43,160
word...cross international cross
border. So we had a split

287
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,910
between Canada and Russia, on
this team. And it was, it was a

288
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,480
bit of a rough onboarding, in
terms of, they're putting me

289
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,670
through my paces, and it had
been a long time since I've been

290
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:04,039
building software. And so I, you
know, I totally get kind of that

291
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:09,740
new developer experience of
getting put on a team. And I

292
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,710
don't know if hazed is the right
word, but maybe a bit where

293
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:23,630
you're, you're getting picked
on. And, and you're expected to

294
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,200
know things that you really
shouldn't be expected to know.

295
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,789
And getting hassled a bit when,
when you stumble. And I

296
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:38,059
remember, I remember breaking
the build, and just being really

297
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,329
upset, like more upset than I
should have been looking back,

298
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,559
it wasn't a big deal, but pay me
at the time. I think I like

299
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,200
cried in my garage office at the
time.

300
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,410
Dan Ott: I mean, that, that kind
of kind of thinking feels so

301
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,380
stressful. Like in the moment,
you know, it's, I think it's

302
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,259
pretty natural reaction. I mean,
it's pretty natural reaction to

303
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,900
something like that, especially
when you're new, right? And

304
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,930
also, especially when it's your
first time, if you're an old hat

305
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,579
at breaking the production
build, like I am, eventually you

306
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,769
realize, like, wait, like he
said, with experience, you

307
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,640
realize maybe, you know, doesn't
have to be as big of a deal. But

308
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:22,009
yeah, like that? I don't know.
That seems...It's so hard to

309
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,680
like think like that when you're
in the moment and sweating and

310
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,900
like, you know, the things
broken? And

311
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,319
Glen McCallum: well, and maybe
it really wasn't even about that

312
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,589
maybe it was just about the fact
that I've been through a wide

313
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:38,150
career swing and stuff going on
at home and all the implications

314
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,539
of that and just all kind of
coming out in that one moment.

315
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,130
Dan Ott: Yeah,

316
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,009
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah I like
to do that, too.

317
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,829
Dan Ott: I was just gonna say,
that's a really good point. I

318
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,869
like the, I was actually to was
talking about with my therapist

319
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,650
about this about how, like, on
some days, like, like, if the

320
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,220
exact event happened on, you
know, one day and then happened,

321
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,539
like, four days later, my, my,
like, my reaction to it the way

322
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,230
I like, react to it in the way
that like, everything else,

323
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,619
like, comes from that will be
completely different can be

324
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:16,210
completely different. If I'm,
you know, in that if I'm, like,

325
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,069
overwhelmed, if there's, you
know, depending on like what the

326
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,859
other external things are
internal things are happening,

327
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:26,859
you know, at the moment. I
don't, you know, I don't know,

328
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:33,309
we're talking about how to,
like, ways to like, remember

329
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,190
that when you're in the moment,
you know, which is like, That's

330
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,470
hard. I mean, I don't even have
it the advice you know, we're

331
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,289
just kind of talking about
talking about it, but But yeah,

332
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,490
that like, anytime you're in a
big transition, you know, of, of

333
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,720
any kind, you know, everything
is going to it's just like a

334
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,039
stress on your system, right?

335
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,779
Glen McCallum: Yeah. But I mean,
just like to point out that if

336
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:03,549
it happened to me could happen
to anybody. I mean, wasn't like

337
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,200
I was new to this game. And, and
going through that and having

338
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,470
that experience, just imagine
what it's like if you really are

339
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,940
new to this game, and you kind
of don't know, the behind the

340
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,170
scenes of how things work.

341
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:23,589
Dan Ott: Right, absolutely. Like
you probably knew that data. No,

342
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,930
I mean, I don't know,
specifically what was happening

343
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,509
with the with breaking the bill,
but like you probably knew, you

344
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:31,180
know, intellectually that you
didn't like destroy the company

345
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,349
or something right. You know,
but like, yeah, if you're, if

346
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:38,440
you're newer to the whole thing,
obviously, the promisee would

347
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
seem seem bigger, you know?

348
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,630
Glen McCallum: Yeah.

349
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,519
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I know.
I've heard of companies when

350
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,160
they're onboarding new
developers, and I don't know if

351
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,430
this goes across the board,
whether it's somebody new to the

352
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,119
team, or just people who are
early in their career, but

353
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,410
they'll introduce them to other
members of the team. And tell

354
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,410
ask the other members of the
team to talk about what they've

355
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,410
broken in the last week or
something like that, or the

356
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,009
their biggest story about that.
And I always thought that was a

357
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:14,980
fun way to kind of maybe defuse
that future situation, or to

358
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,319
say, like, hey, like, this is
normal, we do it and then we

359
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,779
work through it. Right? And
look, we are a team and we get

360
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,109
along.

361
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,619
Glen McCallum: It's a really
good idea. You can you have to

362
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:27,519
have the right team to feel
comfortable sharing that, you

363
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,509
know, there's a certain amount
of egolessness to get people to

364
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,539
open up that way. I think we
could do that. Now. I'm not sure

365
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,829
if we could have done that at
the time.

366
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:36,309
Dan Ott: Yeah

367
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:37,180
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: for sure.

368
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,210
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's I mean,
that's, that is a cool idea. And

369
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,269
it, it's important, I feel like
that the people are sharing

370
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:48,039
their own, you know, moments of
that. It's not like somebody

371
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,519
saying, Oh, this guy messed up
here. And this guy just appears,

372
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,490
you know, like pointing it out
for somebody else. Right? That

373
00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:00,700
doesn't seem as good, right?
That's one of the things I've

374
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:05,049
actually liked about in Virtual
Coffee is having you know, some

375
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:09,369
of the more senior developers,
like, share stories like that a

376
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:13,779
lot. I know, Bryan has. He's the
first one I think of, with with

377
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:20,140
this practice, you know, of just
like, I don't know, like, he

378
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:22,480
also, I mean, he's the, you
know, it's like running the

379
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,900
company. And like, he also has
broken the builds. And his

380
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,049
company, you know, it's just
like, everybody, everybody will

381
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,109
be okay, you know, so that,
like, relating relating that

382
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,769
kind of the same kind of thing.
I feel like it's, I don't know,

383
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,950
seems like a good practice. You
know,

384
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,289
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I also want
to touch on a story that you

385
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,630
have mentioned, if you're up for
it, I'm your first full time job

386
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,049
out of school, the one where you
almost died.

387
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,900
Glen McCallum: Before we go
there, do you want to finish the

388
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,950
topic on change, because up
until now, we've kind of talked

389
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:03,460
about change that I've inflicted
on myself, but there was this

390
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,529
there's been this event in the
last four years where change was

391
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:13,269
kind of inflicted on me. And
that was when the company that

392
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:17,829
the company went to after
leaving the hospital, carved off

393
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,299
kind of half of their products,
and sold them to a book

394
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:27,849
distributor. And with that sale
of those products, they took

395
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,500
three Canadian developers, and I
was one of them. And that whole

396
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,109
thing was a really interesting
day.

397
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:46,880
And it was September 1 2016, as
I recall, and for weeks, there

398
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,140
had been kind of a oddly placed
random status meeting on our

399
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:04,970
calendar for that day. And I
didn't think much of it. And,

400
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,950
and, I mean, the company I was
at had a new CEO, and he had a

401
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,589
new mandate. At the time. I
didn't really know what that

402
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:16,609
mandate was, but he'd been up to
visit and to meet us. We live in

403
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:23,240
Los Angeles, and it come up to
Victoria. And and he'd been

404
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,890
hired by the venture capital
firm that owned a share of the

405
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,019
company. And at the time, I
didn't know but I believe he'd

406
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:39,440
been hired to liquidate the
assets of the company. And so

407
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:48,170
this day was the first sale that
that new CEO had made. And so we

408
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:59,240
walk in, walk in, we joined this
call, and there was a few people

409
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,900
on there that I wasn't expecting
in terms of higher ups. And then

410
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,029
it was like we'd like you to
meet the new owners of this

411
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:22,130
product line. And it was like,
jumped into two hours of

412
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,230
PowerPoint and then talking and
telling us about their new

413
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,910
company. And then it was like,

414
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,650
Dan Ott: and that's the first
you heard of it at all, like the

415
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,730
first, the first

416
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:37,819
Glen McCallum: first mention,
I've heard of it, maybe people

417
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:44,000
knew, maybe I was just isolated.
And then they're like, they were

418
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,119
in San Francisco, at the main
company office, and then they're

419
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:53,210
like, we're all going to lunch.
You guys go have some lunch.

420
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:06,019
And, and at the time, I don't
remember if they were specific

421
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:15,289
about who they were keeping. And
like, we, of course, got off

422
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,670
that call, and all of a sudden
got back on another call, like

423
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:27,650
the secret call. Where we kind
of like, are venting and

424
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,569
debriefing about this whole
thing. And later that day, I got

425
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:46,309
a letter of offer for a job from
them. But it didn't, just the

426
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,240
way. I mean, they're good people
trying their best.

427
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:55,160
But the the letters of offer
weren't quite squared away in

428
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,400
terms of what our current
positions were and what our

429
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,119
benefits were in things, which
is fine. They made good on it.

430
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,460
They matched everything. So, so
stand up job for them. Over the

431
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:13,609
next couple of days, they did
that. But I like not going was

432
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:18,259
not an option for me. I went to
my boss, the same one who hired

433
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:23,180
me two years earlier. And I was
like, What are my options here?

434
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:32,900
And he is like, if you don't go,
we're laying you off. And but

435
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,839
you know how these things are
right, because at the same time,

436
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:45,589
they had job postings. So it's
not like, it's not like they

437
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,740
didn't need people, they were
hiring at the same time, but

438
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:55,730
also learn things in hindsight.
The team that they took was part

439
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,900
of the sale, they didn't want
just the product, they actually

440
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,220
wanted to acqui-hire a software
development team.

441
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:14,089
And so and so that boss in good
faith, in good faith on that

442
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:18,589
deal could not have kept me
because it was it was part of

443
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:28,190
their their deal they'd made
between companies onboarding us,

444
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,029
I would say. I mean,
technically, it was hard.

445
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,210
Because we had shared repos,
shared libraries, shared

446
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,200
infrastructure, shared
continuous integration with the

447
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,220
whole other product line. So it
took us months to kind of tease

448
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:53,210
all these products apart. And,
and get end of our side of the

449
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,980
fence located to a new data
center. And even then, I mean,

450
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,559
the initial hardware that was
SPECT wasn't quite adequate. And

451
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,769
so it wasn't quite running right
until we got some new hardware

452
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:09,469
in place. I learned this as a
software developer, having to

453
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:13,369
take over some infrastructure
planning roles. Because we have

454
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,230
a whole infrastructure team at
the old company at the new

455
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,929
company we didn't and they're
like, Glen, you're in charge of

456
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:28,579
this. Okay, we'll do it. But
yeah, I think it was harder on

457
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,489
their IT team because they they
wanted to software developers,

458
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,849
but they kind of kind of a
smaller it group. And then they

459
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:41,869
brought us in and we're sort of
bit more rough and tumble in how

460
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:48,829
we work together. And we may
have overrun them a little bit

461
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,440
with just our way of doing
things which is good because

462
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,210
it's all following software
engineering best practices. But

463
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,199
I mean back to back to my
onboarding experience. It's a

464
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,590
bit it's a little a little
rougher with each other and some

465
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,050
other teams can be. It's not
like Virtual Coffee.

466
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,260
Dan Ott: That's Yeah, that's,
that's pretty crazy. I try to

467
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,409
integrate, like a new team into
an existing team, you know?

468
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,269
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And like
surprise.

469
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:22,489
Dan Ott: Yeah, the idea of Yeah.
Being a, I don't know, an asset

470
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,849
in acquisition, basically,
without your, you know,

471
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:27,679
knowledge. That's,

472
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,260
Glen McCallum: it's an
interesting experience. Yeah,

473
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:35,780
straight out hearing people all
in good faith. And by no means

474
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:43,519
was it anything...anything shady
going on there? Nobody was

475
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:51,829
trying to, to hurt anyone else,
but just just difficult change

476
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:53,690
thrown upon you.

477
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,030
Dan Ott: When, at that time,
like when that transition

478
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,389
happened, were you still more of
like an individual contributor?

479
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,260
Like in that role?

480
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,630
Glen McCallum: Yes, I was

481
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,380
Dan Ott: so. So is after that.
So because because I know now

482
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,500
you're, you're managing a team.
So that that kind of happened,

483
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,070
like organically over that over
the preceding? I forget where we

484
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,460
are in the timeline, but like,
in the in the in the years after

485
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,760
that?

486
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:29,349
Glen McCallum: Yeah. I mean,
'bout year after there was a

487
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:34,179
software development manager
came over as well with that. And

488
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,699
about a year after we got the
infrastructure migration

489
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:43,119
complete, they announced they
were leaving. And I was offered

490
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,059
the position at that time, I
think, mostly because of my

491
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,590
roles. I'd had him back in
healthcare it.

492
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,730
Dan Ott: Yeah, yeah. Cuz, I
mean, that's, that's a choice,

493
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,039
too. I mean, did you have to
think about it? Like, take,

494
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,429
like, you know, when they
offered? It did, were you? I

495
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:04,750
mean, I assume that, like I did,
like, I mean, like right ...

496
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,130
traditionally the, that sort of
offer will, you know, have be

497
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,500
like a raise and everything, a
new title, whatever. But like,

498
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:14,679
it's, it's a, it's a different
ballgame. Right.

499
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,559
Glen McCallum: I should give a
talk about this...

500
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:22,840
Dan Ott: Well, I mean, you know,
for listeners that don't know,

501
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,920
like, Glen did a lightning talk
on this transition for our

502
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,130
lightning talk round in
February. I knew was I mean, it

503
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,369
was very, very good talking.
Well, the talk is on YouTube, so

504
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,349
we'll link to it. But I, one of
the reasons I was very excited

505
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:41,260
by having you here was was to
like, sort of, have you dig in a

506
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,710
little bit more? Because it's
such like a I don't know, we

507
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,570
were just talking about
transitions this whole time. So

508
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,599
I don't want to say like, Oh,
it's a huge transition, compared

509
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,969
to compared to a lot of the
stuff you've gone through, or

510
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,519
anybody's gone through, but
like, it's still as a career

511
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,360
choice, you know,

512
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,460
Glen McCallum: things different
transition, sort of transition,

513
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:09,190
because, I mean, I went from
kind of a team member to team

514
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,559
owner. Yeah. Some respects.

515
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,809
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Sorry, I
just want to pause for a second

516
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:24,789
and see if you can you define
the difference between IC to

517
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,019
engineering manager

518
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,670
Glen McCallum: define the
difference between that I mean,

519
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,719
it's a it's a in terms of the
work I do day to day, or in

520
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,349
terms of how it felt? Well, you
can go with both, I just want to

521
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:42,460
make sure that listeners
understand what the transition

522
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:47,139
what what that means in terms of
your role and expectations. And,

523
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,920
and I guess how you feel plays
into that for sure. A lot of

524
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,349
that can depend on where you are
where I am, that took me into a

525
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,210
whole new leadership layer that
I didn't have any access to

526
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:08,920
before. And I should qualify
that, that I worked for a big

527
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,590
classifies small company, but in
my mind doesn't really seem very

528
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,329
small. There's 200 staff.
There's one large team of

529
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:27,369
software developers and a few IT
personnel. But in terms of

530
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,900
leadership hierarchy, above me,
I mean, now I report directly to

531
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,409
the CEO and on the software
development manager, so I'm

532
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:43,420
pulled into many strategic
planning, company crisis

533
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,929
meeting, things that things that
I just had no knowledge of

534
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:54,820
before. And I mean, that's kind
of the

535
00:39:48,730 --> 00:40:01,780
the tightness of my team going
through that acquisition and,

536
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:07,539
and having been together through
that. I mean, we didn't keep

537
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:11,920
secrets, that was our policy, no
secrets, no matter who would

538
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:16,329
hurt among us, I mean, we're
trying to hurt anyone else. The

539
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:28,090
policy was you had to tell it.
And, and so me going from

540
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:31,269
independent contributor to the
manager is really me kind of

541
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:37,719
leaving some of the closeness
and the tightness that I felt

542
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:42,159
with those comrades. And kind of
going out and doing more on my

543
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:49,420
own, which is led to a lot of
growth, but also some growing

544
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:52,840
pains there. My work, I do a lot
more project planning now,

545
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:56,110
supervising what other people
are doing. Occasionally, I get

546
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,590
to help people and touch code.
And that's really fun. I'm

547
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:03,639
probably guilty of touching code
too much and avoiding some of my

548
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:07,570
other duties. But that's just
me. You want me to hit on some

549
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,440
of the things I talked about in
my presentation?

550
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,340
Dan Ott: Yeah, I mean, I like
that, that I've been, I can't

551
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,559
remember what podcast was, I was
listening to another podcast

552
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:20,809
about, about this, and about the
how Traditionally, the way to

553
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,480
move up in a company or you
know, get a raise, or whatever

554
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,719
it is, you know, there's just
like a ceiling for being a, like

555
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,190
an individual developer. And the
next step is always management,

556
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,940
you know, but the in the podcast
I was listing to is about

557
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:40,280
pushing back on on the idea. I
know. Not everybody like, has

558
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:44,510
is, you know, possibly good at
being a manager, or wants to be

559
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:52,489
a manager, you know, and things
like that. And, and so anybody

560
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,159
that has, like, consciously made
this transition at you know, I

561
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,190
always want to, like, the things
I wasn't want to know is like,

562
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:04,099
like, did you think about that
at the time? And now that you're

563
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:06,860
in it? You know, it's, from what
I can tell, it seems like you're

564
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,260
pretty comfortable in the
position, but like, are you like

565
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,500
glad? Do you ever think about
moving back to being, you know,

566
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,090
like, it? And I see like, in
another, you know, if you could

567
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,719
keep all the whatever your
current benefits and everything,

568
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,920
but be coding all day, instead
of managing? Would you take that

569
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,079
job? Or, you know, would you
think about it, you know, that

570
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,590
kind of...I know that that was
just like 7000 questions that

571
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,030
you can pick which one you want
to hit, sir.

572
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:37,309
Glen McCallum: I'm gonna start
at the beginning. Yeah, there

573
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,550
definitely was a ceiling. I
think at any mall company,

574
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,619
there's going to be a ceiling
and how far you can progress as

575
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,300
an independent contributor.
Oracle's different Oracle had

576
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,809
career tax for software
development, you could have, I

577
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,139
mean, you could go all the way
up through the levels, almost to

578
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,960
the top as an independent
contributor. I mean, there were

579
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,329
ceilings that you're not going
to go to the executive later

580
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,750
moving from independently
contributor, you had to go

581
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,150
through the management track to
get kind of up past that. But

582
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,670
you can go a long way as an
independent contributor or call

583
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:14,480
and get very good income. So but
at this small company, I mean,

584
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:23,630
there really wasn't any place
for me to go. In fact, I'd say,

585
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,940
about six months before that, I
was looking for another job,

586
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,989
just because I didn't think
anybody was ever leaving. That

587
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:35,570
was ahead of me, and I wasn't
going to have any place to go.

588
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,630
And I was looking for some place
with more of a progression

589
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:44,989
possible. But I had a really
unexpected

590
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:51,710
health care issue, that year,
health issue and a diagnosis.

591
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:56,239
And so over those months, it was
just not even on my radar. I was

592
00:43:51,710 --> 00:44:00,199
just trying to make some life
adjustments. And so when that

593
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:10,340
came up was completely
unexpected. And, you know, I did

594
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:14,360
think a lot about it quickly. In
that, you know, I wasn't in a

595
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:18,289
place to make a ... transition
that year, just because of that,

596
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:22,219
that stuff I was going through
in the other part of my life.

597
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:28,489
And so I kind of looked at it
like, I kind of took over the

598
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:36,170
team when that other person
left. And what were my options?

599
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:39,800
I say no. And I'm still running
the team while they hire

600
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:46,099
someone. And then I'm going to
be training the person probably

601
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:52,340
and doing part of their workload
for, I'd say, a period of

602
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:55,760
months, and maybe, maybe I don't
even ever stop doing part of

603
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,579
their workload. We'll see. I see
what they're like, maybe there.

604
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,630
Maybe they don't work out. You
know, this just and I just think

605
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:09,829
At my current rate, or if I take
it, at least I get a new job

606
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:14,630
title and a pay raise and do
what I would have had to do

607
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:18,949
anyway. Yeah, totally. So that
was the decision that kind of

608
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:21,440
led me through there. Sorry, I
lost the the second part of your

609
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,440
question.

610
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,230
Dan Ott: If you don't remember,
I certainly don't remember

611
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,429
Glen McCallum: if I can do it
over again or?

612
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,349
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: not, if you
could do it over again. But if

613
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:31,820
you had the opportunity to go
back coding all of the time,

614
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:35,630
with the same benefits that you
have in your role?

615
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,150
Dan Ott: Yeah. So not like,
would you go back and make a

616
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,230
different choice? But like,
right now, you know, how much do

617
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:47,690
you miss? coding is, I guess,
like the right. I mean, like,

618
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,039
you don't have to answer like
that.

619
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:54,920
Glen McCallum: Do I think about
it? Only every day.... I mean, I

620
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,070
equate that to taking a step
back in the progression of your

621
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:06,260
life to a certain extent. Would
it be awesome to go back and

622
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,449
live with my parents? My mom
makes me french toast every

623
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:13,639
morning. Yeah, that'd be really
cool. But would you really want

624
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:21,800
to do do that? No, I don't think
that I could

625
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:24,320
go back and kind of that back to
that same goal where I was

626
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,340
before, I think there might be
something different for me in

627
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:30,559
the future where I get to do
more coding, but we'll just see

628
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,559
kind of where that leads.

629
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:38,039
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so I
think there, there are two ways

630
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:44,429
that this can go. So I still
want to hear your story. Um,

631
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,079
about your first job.

632
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:48,840
Glen McCallum: The story where I
almost drowned?

633
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,530
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah.

634
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,130
Glen McCallum: See, I didn't
even put that in my speaker

635
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,570
notes there.

636
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,389
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Well...

637
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,860
Glen McCallum: But you
remembered because I told you at

638
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,369
some point,

639
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,989
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah, you
put it in slack. And I still

640
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:01,920
have a record of that.

641
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:07,260
Glen McCallum: So my very first
job at a university was setting

642
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,210
up health IT systems in remote
Aboriginal communities along the

643
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:18,539
western coast of Canada. And so
many of these communities or

644
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:25,349
villages are flying only or boat
and I guess traditionally boat

645
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:32,610
in. And so to go do this work,
and we'd be getting satellite

646
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,199
Satellite Internet hookups,
being some advanced wireless

647
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,440
signals off different islands
from the mainland kind of thing.

648
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:53,369
We'd get to charter flow planes.
And so getting to this day, if I

649
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:57,449
get on a float plane, I fall
asleep. Because I had to leave

650
00:47:53,369 --> 00:48:00,420
my house, I'd drive for two,
three hours, it'd be like

651
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:00,420
3 30am, I get to the flow plane

652
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,230
dock at 4 30am. We get on a flow
plane, we fly for two hours and

653
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:09,210
get to our destination. But as
soon as I hit the flow plane

654
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:15,449
every morning, I was just out.
But the company put us through

655
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:21,960
this. It's called egress
training. And what it is, is, I

656
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:30,989
mean, statistically, any plane
class crashes, like, I don't

657
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:33,719
know what the percentage is.
super high percentage to happen

658
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,880
on landing or takeoff. And the
the creator of this course,

659
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:41,324
survived a plane crash himself
on the Fraser River in

660
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:43,589
Vancouver.

661
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:51,119
And after that, the RCMP started
calling him in to help

662
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,420
investigate other plane crashes,
especially on water. And what

663
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:05,909
they found was that everybody
was surviving these crashes and

664
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:11,340
getting trapped in the plane and
drowning. And float planes

665
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,639
float. So these people were
drowning, like, only a few feet

666
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,969
below the surface of the water,
because they couldn't get out of

667
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:21,449
the plane,

668
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,519
Dan Ott: because it's upside
down, right?

669
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:26,670
Glen McCallum: Yeah, the plane
inverts the pontoons hold the

670
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,170
plane up. And so he created this
course to teach people how to

671
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:41,519
exit inverted submerged planes.
And so, I was put through this

672
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:45,030
course. And the way he did it is
he had to forfeit deep hotel

673
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:58,679
swimming pool and he had built
this fuselage with seats in it

674
00:49:45,030 --> 00:50:05,369
and doors and windows and this
is strap you in The seat and

675
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:11,159
essentially, like, dump you into
the pool upside down. And, I

676
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:15,630
mean, this is it happens in
stages. So, I mean, first you

677
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:22,500
practice getting yourself out
and getting your belt off and

678
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:26,940
memorizing where the door handle
is and where your hand positions

679
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:32,760
are kicking out a window. And
then, I mean, it leads up to you

680
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:37,380
dumping this fuselage thing in
the pool upside down, and you

681
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:41,940
have to get yourself out. And
there's actually a smaller one,

682
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:45,869
too, as well that it's for more
advanced, this little cage thing

683
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:51,030
with doors and windows. And what
they do in that one is they,

684
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:56,760
they tumble you until you're
just completely disoriented. And

685
00:50:51,030 --> 00:51:05,309
and then you have to get your
way out. And I was in the

686
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:10,949
tumbler one and got out, but I
just had no idea which way was

687
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:17,280
the surface of the water kind of
thing. And yeah, I got like one

688
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:23,820
foot on the ground, luckily, and
just like got my head up and

689
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:28,260
vomited. I got I took in water,
and I can see how people drown.

690
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,260
I learned a lot in that moment.

691
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:28,769
Dan Ott: Yeah,

692
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:29,940
Glen McCallum: So that was

693
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,849
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: like two
things. One, I would never have

694
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:40,159
expected for my first job in
tech to have to experience that

695
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:43,849
and two, Glen. I think this
whole podcast episode, you've

696
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:46,760
talked about a million things
that like have terrified me.

697
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,940
I've had a stress reaction here.
And you're just like, so calm

698
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:55,250
talking about it. I very much
want to know how you do that,

699
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,550
too.

700
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:00,260
Glen McCallum: I don't know,
maybe that's why I got the job I

701
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:07,130
have would just figure it out,
start moving forward. Take

702
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:07,940
things as they come.

703
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,469
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. And I
just I want to touch too on.

704
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,050
Okay, so you talked about you
faced a challenge a couple of

705
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,239
years ago, and that was kind of
part of this decision making

706
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:22,250
thing, right. And so I'm not
positive about what that

707
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,719
challenge was. But I think that
maybe that has to do with your

708
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,579
diabetes diagnosis. Is that
true?

709
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,869
Glen McCallum: That's true. I
mean, that's a, that's a whole

710
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:35,059
other story in itself, we have
time for it.

711
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:43,340
The brief version is I lost 38
pounds in about three months.

712
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:51,320
And that was while I was like
eating everything in sight. I

713
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,900
would literally like go to the
grocery store at 10 o'clock at

714
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:00,079
night because I was hungry. And
I mean to anybody familiar with

715
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:05,150
Type One Diabetes, this is
really kind of stereotypical

716
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,039
behavior. Other symptoms, kind
of went back a few years it had

717
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:14,269
been progressing, runs in my
family. My grandfather had it,

718
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,989
my grandfather died of it. And
so you know, I drink a gallon a

719
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:27,920
half of water per day. It would
be like, you know, one liter

720
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,639
bottle of Nalgene, I'd be like,
I just need a little drink water

721
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:34,460
before bed and drink the whole
thing and like 10 seconds.

722
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,789
So made a doctor's appointment.
And the doctor knew. And it's

723
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:51,199
quite unusual to get type one
diabetes as an adult. Normally,

724
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,559
there's, there's kind of two
ages that are common to have an

725
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,099
onset of type one diabetes, a
one is around five or six years

726
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:03,139
old. The second one is late
teens, you know, 18 to 20 years

727
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,260
old, can have an onset, and I
was a bit older than that.

728
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:12,230
And so they sent me to an
endocrinologist to get all these

729
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,039
tests. And I mean, the
interesting part about this

730
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:21,230
whole story they gave me needles
is it's all no fun. And I had to

731
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:31,190
learn how to use it. But is that
I got introduced to

732
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:38,449
this idea of an open source
artificial pancreas. And this is

733
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:46,280
a really amazing community.
Because the open source

734
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:51,170
solutions have far surpassed
what's available commercially.

735
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:54,650
This is the term is called we're
not waiting if you're looking

736
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:59,090
for it on the internet. And it's
actually I believe, driven by

737
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:04,070
parents of diabetic kids who
build software. And have made an

738
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:10,519
incredible set of open source
tools for advanced diabetic

739
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:14,960
care. And so there's kind of two
main components to, to this one

740
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:15,559
is called the continuous glucose
monitor.

741
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,199
And it it's like a sticker that
gets stuck on you with a

742
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:25,489
Bluetooth transmitter on it. And
there's a little filament of

743
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,210
wire that goes under your skin.
And it continuously monitors

744
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,559
your blood sugar levels
throughout the day, you get that

745
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,869
you get that from a company
called dex calm, that's where I

746
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:41,300
get mine, there's a few. And
then you have an insulin pump.

747
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,909
And it continuously microdoses
insulin throughout the day to

748
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:53,389
maintain your proper blood sugar
level. And the crazy part about

749
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,489
this situation is that these are
made by two different companies,

750
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:59,599
and they've never actually got
together and figured out you

751
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,369
know, hey, I can sense the blood
sugar level, and you can dose

752
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:09,829
the insulin. When I eat, if I'm
just using a

753
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:13,940
straight up insulin pump, I have
to you know, count my carbs, and

754
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:19,429
program how much insulin to give
myself or if I'm going to

755
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:23,989
exercise I have to like reduce
my insulin level ahead of time,

756
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:30,530
or else all I need to eat sugar.
Because exercise burns sugar. So

757
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:34,550
what this open source community
did is they built a bridge

758
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:41,960
between the two, with with
university researchers as well.

759
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:45,500
And so my phone, the software
running on my Android phone acts

760
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:49,550
as a kind of an artificial
intelligence bridge, there's a

761
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:52,820
certain algorithm analysis in
there, that senses my blood

762
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:59,869
sugar levels and automatically
adjust my insulin dosage levels.

763
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:02,239
And, like I said, the crazy
thing is that this, this

764
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:05,119
couldn't have been figured out
by industry, they couldn't have

765
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:10,670
talked to each other and done
this. To me, people were

766
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:15,349
literally taking the wireless
remote for the insulin pump and

767
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:16,159
reverse engineering The, the
commands to it.

768
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,800
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I mean, so
this is this all fascinating.

769
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:24,409
And one of the things that I was
thinking about so my first

770
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:30,260
instinct, if I weren't intact
would be to be really afraid of

771
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:36,380
that. But I was wondering if
you're because you are in tech,

772
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,440
because you kind of understand
what's going on? Did that

773
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,039
impact, like the solutions that
you were looking for? Or you're

774
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,210
trusting this? Or I don't know,
just how did you decide to make

775
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:47,719
this?

776
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:51,139
Glen McCallum: I mean, it's all
not the FDA approved, let's,

777
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,980
let's come up with that. Right
away, I think that I couldn't

778
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,500
have pursued this. If I didn't
have a background in tech. I

779
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,000
mean, I had to build Android
clients from scratch and deploy

780
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,980
them myself, myself, and that
sort of thing. Number one,

781
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,980
number two, I was lucky I even
found it isn't like this is

782
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,280
advertised. It's not like the
doctors are telling you about

783
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,730
it. I mean, my family doctor, I
don't even think I've explained

784
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:28,039
it to her. I just she's just
like, Yeah, you got a pump,

785
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:33,139
good. My endocrinologist knows
about it. Because he specializes

786
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:37,610
in this. And he thought, you
know, this is, this is pretty

787
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,159
cool. Let me know how it goes.
You got a background, you know

788
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:46,219
what you're doing? He said he
has one other patient, you know,

789
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:49,340
of his entire patient load. He
has one other patient who does

790
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:57,739
loopings what it's called, you
close the loop. And he's like,

791
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,960
Yeah, tell me about it when you
come back next time.

792
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:09,320
And so in terms of me being
afraid to try it, not really.

793
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,949
Oh, yeah, it wasn't first. It
was at first but everything's

794
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:16,670
subtle in degrees, right? It's
not like live or die, pass or

795
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:21,170
fail. There's a lot of areas of
gray in between everything. And

796
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:33,260
I mean, I had I had problems. At
first I'll see that. The nurse

797
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,969
that set me up with my pump
initially, who probably still

798
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:42,500
doesn't know that I have this
running. Initially dosed me

799
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:48,139
about 30% too high. Maybe more
than that, maybe 50% too high

800
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:58,760
even on my insulin. And it's
really subtle. From me who

801
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:07,280
doesn't know anything to tell
that necessarily because there's

802
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,510
no that was, that's my kind of
constant level throughout the

803
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:16,909
day, she dosed really high. And
it's mixed in, I'm giving myself

804
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:23,000
other doses when I eat. So it's
really hard for me to tell that

805
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,789
that that base level was, was
too high.

806
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:38,059
And so I had problems with my,
my algorithm setup. Based on

807
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:46,610
that for six months, maybe. And
I say problems, what, what's the

808
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,349
solution to the problem, it just
means I got to eat. And so

809
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,250
luckily, I have, I have a
constant monitor, and it has an

810
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,659
alarm that tells me what I need
to eat. But I got, there's a

811
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:04,159
book that the endocrinologist
recommended I read. Initially,

812
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:09,289
that was like, months before.
And so I started reading this

813
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:11,989
book one day, and it started
giving me these protocols to

814
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:20,840
actually determined my correct
levels. And I did them involves

815
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,369
a lot of fasting and pricking
your finger every two hours

816
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:29,630
throughout the night. And that's
how I got my correct base level

817
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:35,030
figured out. And once I got
that, things started to go

818
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:40,639
smoother with the artificial
pancreas feedback loop.

819
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,980
Dan Ott: That's, that's crazy,
it's tough to win when the kind

820
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:53,719
of thing takes time to figure
out and it's also like, your

821
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:59,510
health, you know, like your
body. And it's so hard, I don't,

822
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:05,119
Glen McCallum: I never really
found someone to talk to about

823
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,000
this. I'm still going at it by
myself. And it's one reason why

824
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,050
I bring it up. Sometimes it's
like, if there's someone else

825
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,190
struggling with this, I want
them to talk to me, the I mean,

826
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:23,000
the docs, let's just say open
source docs. Nuff said there.

827
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:31,849
But they tell you, and there's
like a gajillion settings on

828
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:36,530
this thing. And they tell you
kind of what give you an

829
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:42,800
explanation of each setting. But
they don't really tell you how

830
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,869
to know what to set it to, like
how it applies to you. And so

831
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:54,199
it's been a lot of trial and
error there. On my own party. I

832
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,769
mean, it goes on every week,
every day, trying different

833
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:00,710
things, trying different set
different settings. And I don't

834
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,070
have everything dialed in yet,
but it's like way closer than it

835
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:10,159
was. So, I mean, I still
consider myself lucky to have

836
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,239
stumbled on this number one.
Number two, lucky to have the

837
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:20,690
technical knowledge to even get
it running by myself. And number

838
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:28,340
three, like the effectiveness of
the treatment using the open

839
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:34,550
source system is lightyears
ahead of what is available

840
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:38,780
through traditional medicine
like there is absolutely no

841
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,030
comparison not even in the same
bill ballpark.

842
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:46,199
Dan Ott: So hard to imagine.

843
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Right? And
that's what's so frustrating. I

844
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:55,010
don't know, the healthcare
industry is one of the things

845
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,980
that frustrates me the most for
like exactly this reason, right?

846
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:01,849
Like there are things that they
try that we treat people over

847
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:04,789
and over in the very same ways
that are not accurate or not the

848
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:09,800
best ways. And then newer and
better ways aren't pursued, or

849
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,400
they just take so much time, or
just people don't even doctors

850
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,940
don't even know to offer them.
Right. And so then there's just

851
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:19,639
I don't know, my inner rage
comes out when I talk about

852
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:25,400
this. Because it's just it's not
fair. Like we're letting people

853
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,670
down by not pursuing these
different ways or the the most

854
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:36,769
exciting way or whatever. Like
maybe you're not going to make

855
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:39,980
headlines for doing this thing.
And so then nobody pursues it.

856
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,139
Glen McCallum: But gosh, put
insurance companies in that mix?

857
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:45,539
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's the
worst. Like, I'm in the middle

858
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:49,230
of that right now. And it's just
such a shame. And that's why,

859
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,280
you know, I'm really glad that
you talked about this because,

860
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,610
you know, hopefully one person
hears it and they tell another

861
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,849
person and just, I think even
sometimes knowing that there are

862
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:03,210
options out there that you
haven't stumbled upon is enough

863
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,809
to provide hope for somebody
who, who's just going through a

864
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,309
really rough time with it, you
know?

865
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:15,150
Glen McCallum: Yeah. And I mean,
it's, it's quite humorous

866
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:19,739
looking back. There's even if
you have a child who's diabetic,

867
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:23,969
there's great monitoring tools
that that had been built in. So

868
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,389
me, I monitor myself, obviously,
I'm able to do that. But I mean,

869
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:34,949
this cannot be this is all
internet enabled through

870
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:38,429
cellular data, if you have this
on your child, you can be

871
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:40,590
monitoring constantly, if
they're not managing themselves,

872
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:45,269
you can manage them remotely. If
it's a small child, we set up

873
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:48,719
this up. Initially, for me, it
seemed like a good idea, because

874
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:55,050
I do a lot of work outside by
myself. And, and this is, I

875
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,750
mean, in that initial month,
when I was first trying this,

876
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:04,800
and I had monitoring setup to my
wife's phone.

877
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,989
And the exact same monitoring
you'd use if you had one of your

878
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:12,539
children on this. And I was
working at the back of the

879
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:15,809
property doing my thing, and not
really paying attention to

880
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:23,610
anything. And she like comes
running through the field with I

881
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:29,820
don't remember like sugar and
water and these things, and, and

882
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:34,079
I'm just like, Hey, what's going
on? She's like, convinced then

883
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,480
like, laying there dying?
Because my connection was

884
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:45,329
disconnected. It was it was it
was not reading accurately.

885
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:50,670
Dan Ott: Well, nice to know she
is ready to ready.

886
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,429
Glen McCallum: So that was the
last day the monitoring was

887
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:55,920
installed in her phone. After
that. She's like, You're on your

888
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,400
own. So now I'm on my own. But
it's been good. It's very

889
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,460
difficult to get into that type
of situation. Now that I have it

890
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,300
tuned better.

891
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,030
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Wow, Glen,
this has just been such a great

892
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,690
hour plus talking through all of
these things. I just very much

893
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,610
like hearing you talk about all
of this. All these things that

894
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,980
you've gone through and all of
these things that you've done,

895
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:30,329
and just hearing your story,
because you're a really great

896
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:34,170
storyteller teller. So it's easy
to you know, just sit back and

897
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,659
listen. So I very much
appreciate you sharing all of

898
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:39,570
this stuff for everybody else to
hear as well.

899
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:40,949
Glen McCallum: Thank you.

900
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:43,230
Dan Ott: Yeah, I agree. I feel
like you have a unique

901
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:47,610
perspective on life. I'm sure
some of that is from, you know,

902
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:50,940
created from your experiences.
And some of that is, you know, I

903
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,349
don't know, innate or whatever.
But I always I always like, kind

904
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:57,869
of listen to you. Talk about
your experiences. And you know,

905
01:07:57,929 --> 01:08:00,269
the way the way you've kind of
viewed things as you go through

906
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:02,099
them. I Appreciate it.

907
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:03,389
Glen McCallum: Thanks, Dan.

908
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:06,719
