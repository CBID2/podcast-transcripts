00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,310
Bekah: Hey, this is season one
episode, one of the

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,450
Virtual Coffee podcast.

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,750
I'm Bekah and this is a podcast
that features

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,830
members of the community.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,370
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,840
stages of their coding journey.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,070
And they're here on this podcast
to share their stories and talk

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,000
about what they've learned.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,210
And we're here to share that
with you here with

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,880
me today as my co-host Dan,
how's it going, Dan?

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,630
It's going

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,080
Dan: pretty good.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,440
Thanks.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,650
Bekah.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,950
Um, today we have a really great
episode.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,900
We're gonna hear from Nick
Taylor.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,630
Uh, Nick is a senior software
engineer at forum.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,460
Uh, the company behind dev.

19
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:54,165
He's a big fan of type script,
JavaScript, uh,

20
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,845
react and pre-ACT and node.

21
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:59,235
Um, once upon a time he was into
C sharp and esp.net.

22
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,415
Aside from programming, he
enjoys hitting the

23
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,474
gym snowboarding and a long,
long time ago.

24
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,414
Rugby Nick is also one of our
first members.

25
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:08,745
He is.

26
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,255
Been in Virtual Coffee since
nearly the beginning, he has

27
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:13,965
helped us out in, uh, many ways.

28
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:17,085
He's been a note taker and a
room leader, a mentor, an open

29
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:20,745
source maintainer, and an all
around awesome human being.

30
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:24,675
So Nick is gonna talk about live
streaming and open

31
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,705
source, and he will share with
us his approach to life,

32
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,515
which he calls structured.

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,835
Yo.

34
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,145
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

35
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,185
Like we start every Virtual
Coffee.

36
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,065
We introduce ourselves with our
name where we're

37
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,634
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

38
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:45,195
Today's question is what is one
thing you are afraid

39
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:45,405
Dan: of?

40
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:48,794
We hope you'll enjoy this
episode of the Virtual Coffee

41
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:49,515
Nick: podcast.

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,100
Bekah: Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a
front end developer

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,840
from a small town in Ohio.

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,080
And one of my biggest fears is
waffle bridges.

45
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,780
Dan: Hi, I am Dan.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,430
I am a front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio, and one of

47
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,770
my biggest fears is Hornets.

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:18,960
Don't

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,230
Nick: like 'em.

50
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,950
Ah, yeah.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
My name is Nick Taylor.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,850
I'm a senior software engineer
at forum and.

53
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:31,335
I'd say my, one of my biggest
fears is Heights.

54
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,455
I am not a big fan of Heights.

55
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:39,645
Uh, I remember in grade six, I
cried at the bottom of the scene

56
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:44,025
tower because I had a hard time
going up and it was traumatic.

57
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,025
Oh no.

58
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:48,495
So you wanna know how I ended up

59
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:49,785
Bekah: yeah.

60
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:50,025
Yeah.

61
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,255
Let's start with your origin
story.

62
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,515
How'd you get into programming.

63
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,470
Nick: Uh, it's I don't know.

64
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,200
I feel like it's a classic story
of, uh, somebody who has

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,730
no idea what they wanna do.

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,555
Um, I, I had a computer.

67
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,375
Like we had computers when I was
younger, like, uh, had

68
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,295
a V 20 I'm a little older.

69
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:14,445
So that's like bef I think that
was before the Commodor

70
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,955
64 or after I can't remember the
order, but, you know,

71
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,865
so it was, that was fun as a
kid, just doing stuff like

72
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,745
printing your name multiple
times over the screen.

73
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,235
And, uh, we eventually got like
a, a clone PC, which was,

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,715
seemed to be the, the big thing
in the day in the eighties.

75
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:36,810
Uh, The actual, like, I guess, I
guess it would've been

76
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,135
IBM machines were a lot more
expensive and, uh, Didn't

77
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,304
really do too much on there.

78
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:47,265
Like my, my dad's an accountant
and financial planner, so he

79
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,894
he's always like working in
spreadsheets and stuff and we

80
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:51,975
didn't really have any games.

81
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:55,454
So like I was making pie charts
in Lotus 1, 2, 3, and

82
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:59,265
I just thought that was cool on
a monochrome, uh, monitor.

83
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:03,165
But, uh, and then eventually got
a, a couple, couple

84
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:06,795
games there and like a clone
pack, man, a lot of stuff.

85
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:11,225
But that was, that was kind of
like my early

86
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,535
introduction to computers.

87
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:18,515
Uh, but I honestly was never
like a diehard programmer.

88
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:25,805
Um, it was only a really, once I
got to C J, C E is like, it's

89
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,625
like the last two years of high
school in the states, I guess.

90
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,205
It's we don't have like a grade
12 grade 13.

91
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,335
So you, you go to grade 11.

92
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:36,974
And you can either go straight
to university.

93
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,554
Like if you go out of province
or out of country,

94
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:43,424
but if you're in Quebec, you,
you typically need to

95
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:46,304
do these, um, which is where I'm
from, I'm from Montreal.

96
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,015
Um, but I.

97
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:53,265
Basically, I ended up bombing my
first semester cuz uh,

98
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:56,085
I was dating somebody and I was
just doing that and

99
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,645
playing rugby pretty much.

100
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:03,495
Um, and then after failing my
first semester, I just kinda got

101
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,575
back on track a bit and I was in
creative arts, which at the

102
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,445
time there was like, literally
take any courses you want.

103
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,215
And I was always.

104
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,720
Pretty pretty good at math.

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,710
So I ended up taking, uh, Cal
one and Cal two courses and

106
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,510
I took a C plus plus course.

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,170
And, uh, literally the only
reason why I ended

108
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,330
up going into computer science,
the only reason why

109
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,070
I did was like I did okay.

110
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,420
In that C plus plus course.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,930
And.

112
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:31,844
but it wasn't anything special.

113
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,935
It's like, I think I remember
one of the final exercises was

114
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,275
like making a Christmas tree
outta stars, you know, and

115
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:41,805
it's, you're just basically
repeating it, but, uh, yeah,

116
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:45,915
that's, that's really kind of
how I got into programming,

117
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:48,165
I guess, which I know that
doesn't sound that exciting.

118
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:49,425
Um, I.

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,215
but the exciting part for me was
there was the, there was

120
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,685
no web courses at the time.

121
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,295
Like I was in university when it
was always just

122
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:03,165
like, learn about databases,
data structures, uh,

123
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,505
operating systems and.

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,270
There was everything web.

125
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,130
I literally learnt on my own.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,980
I remember opening no joke,
notepad dot exc in a, in

127
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,750
a cracked version of, uh,
windows, uh, server 2000

128
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,980
I think, or something.

129
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,900
And I just started learning
HTML, JavaScript,

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,730
and CSS through there.

131
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,820
And you know, the computer.

132
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:36,935
Background helped, but, uh, I
probably could have done

133
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,945
a lot better in school, but I, I
was doing a lot

134
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,055
of sports and stuff too.

135
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:44,225
I, I was pretty active playing
rugby, so, um, but

136
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:47,585
yeah, that's, that's, that's my
boring origin story for

137
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,635
getting into programming.

138
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,015
It's not like, yeah.

139
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:52,745
I was like hacking the matrix
when I was two or something.

140
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,525
but, uh, but the funny thing is
once I finished school,

141
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,330
I felt like I was learning more
outside of school.

142
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,100
Like I was actually motivated to
learn outta

143
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,210
school when I was in school.

144
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,620
I wasn't as motivated.

145
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,430
So it's, uh, it's kind of funny,
uh, in that respect.

146
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,130
And then it's pretty much just
gone from there.

147
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:17,145
Uh, I've been mostly, I'd say
about two thirds of my career

148
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,065
has been in the.net ecosystem.

149
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:23,325
So, uh, well, even before.net,
before.net, there was

150
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,575
something called ASSP.

151
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:29,115
So active server pages and you.

152
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,130
They even had JS script, which
was like Microsoft's

153
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:36,719
version of JavaScript and there
was VB script.

154
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,400
So you could program pages.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,190
It's, it's kind of like PHP kind
of, and then.net came

156
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,979
out and then you ended up with
asp.net, which, uh, and then, so

157
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,990
that's the whole.net ecosystem.

158
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,270
And I basically was in the area
up until about 2016.

159
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,560
But I was, was a big fan of
JavaScript and I like the

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,910
web stuff and I just happened to
be in the.net ecosystem

161
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,520
cuz that's just where jobs ended
up coming from.

162
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,990
Like somebody I knew and say,
oh, why don't

163
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,130
you come work here now?

164
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,810
And um, but yeah, when I, when I
hit 2016, I had this

165
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,330
opportunity to I'd already.

166
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:24,494
Been doing, uh, kind of more
full stack at that point, uh,

167
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:29,744
and, uh, had an opportunity to
take a, a role as a front

168
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:33,255
end dev doing react and type
script for this FinTech startup.

169
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,444
And I haven't looked back since
then.

170
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:39,225
Like, I mean, uh, everything
pretty much is front end for me.

171
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,584
Now I can, I mean, I have no
problem working in back end if I

172
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,345
need to, but for now, at least.

173
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,650
Super stoked about working in
the front end and like,

174
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,140
like anything, always lots to
learn there still, even if

175
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,190
I've been around for a while.

176
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,550
So

177
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:54,840
Bekah: yeah.

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,470
I love that.

179
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,820
I think that's really great.

180
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,030
And I like that, you know,
you've been here for a while,

181
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,180
but you've done a lot of
different things and you have

182
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,560
a good understanding of, um, you
know, where you're going

183
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,550
and what you're interested in.

184
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,690
And I think that, you know,
that's really, um, a fun and

185
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,270
interesting thing to talk about.

186
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:20,775
Nick: Yeah, I, I find, uh, I
find I've been able slowly

187
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,835
over time to figure out what I
don't wanna do, which is good.

188
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,095
So

189
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:26,745
Dan: that's that's that sounds
familiar.

190
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,115
yeah, that, that's sort of how
I've I, that sounds familiar to

191
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,425
me, you know, I've, I've done
end up doing the same thing.

192
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:37,025
I make more decisions based on,
yeah, I don't wanna do that

193
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:40,725
then, then practical, like,
okay, this is the thing that

194
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:41,895
I'm going to do, you know?

195
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:42,885
Yeah.

196
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,325
Served me, served me pretty well
too.

197
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,350
Nick: Yeah, for sure.

198
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,490
And, and the front end right
now, I feel like, I mean, uh, I

199
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,540
mean the tech space in general
is, well, I guess, I guess

200
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,720
it's a little different cuz of
the pandemic, but I at least

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,640
what I've seen, like excluding
the pandemic for now, uh, like

202
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,740
just front end jobs typically.

203
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,450
Just like everywhere.

204
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,240
Everybody's O I mean, a lot of
'em are always asking for

205
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,630
react because that's like pretty
much the dominant front end

206
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,710
framework right now, I would
say, but, uh, but still like

207
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:17,760
just lots of opportunities.

208
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,510
So I don't know.

209
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,120
I feel like I transitioned to
doing that.

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,189
At, uh, at the right time.

211
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,610
So,

212
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,829
Bekah: yeah, and I love that
idea.

213
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:28,319
I know when I was learning, so,
you know, I'm a

214
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,360
newer programmer, but
everybody's like, well,

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,410
what do you want to do?

216
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,699
Like, what do you really like?

217
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,680
But nobody says like, what don't
you like?

218
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,069
Right.

219
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Um, and I think that could be a
really great way to

220
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,150
kind of narrow it down.

221
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,329
It's a different approach to
things, but, um, you know,

222
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,990
ideally you find a job that you
enjoy doing and that's what

223
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,530
kind of creates longevity and
helps you to avoid burnout.

224
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,280
And that type of.

225
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:53,745
Nick: Yeah, for sure.

226
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:54,885
And it's yeah.

227
00:10:54,885 --> 00:11:00,375
It's but I feel like it, it it's
honestly, only something you

228
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,595
can really get with experience.

229
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,935
I think, because like, cuz I've
been working

230
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:09,855
in at like my first real
programming job was in 2002.

231
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,765
So I've been in the space for
like about 18 years now.

232
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:13,155
So.

233
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:16,555
You know, if you asked me as a
junior, I wouldn't

234
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:19,495
say, uh, you know, this is not
what I wanna do.

235
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,425
My first job.

236
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:24,085
I just took it without asking
any questions because I was

237
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:25,165
just happy to get a job.

238
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:25,925
So.

239
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,130
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's
great.

240
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,360
I know that I really hated react
when I was doing it.

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,830
And that's pretty much all I've
done.

242
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,430
So I guess that there are times
that you find things

243
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,640
that you, you enjoy, even if you
initially don't like them.

244
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,860
Um, I would love to know how you
found out about Virtual Coffee,

245
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,450
because I, I, this is how I met
you and I just wanna know,

246
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,800
like, how did you end up here?

247
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,010
Nick: Yeah, well, uh, you know,
I think, uh, as we all know,

248
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,870
2020 is a dumpster fire, uh,
for, for many, many reasons,

249
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,580
but predominantly the pandemic.

250
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,470
Um, and I actually remember, I
didn't know you at the

251
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,740
time, but, uh, I'm generally
pretty active on Twitter.

252
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,940
And because I work at forum,
which was previously dev

253
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm, I'm usually interacting a
lot with, I, I tend to

254
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,130
interact with the community a
lot and I remember.

255
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:30,135
I only saw this in hindsight,
but I, I, I realized that,

256
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:33,225
uh, I was actually responding to
some of your questions

257
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,665
on code newbie at one point.

258
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,075
Uh, and then I, I forget when
you posted it, but

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,935
you had your initial.

260
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:45,645
Uh, tweet that was like, Hey,
Virtual Coffee,

261
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:46,425
come check it out.

262
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:50,505
And I said yes to the first one,
but then something came

263
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:54,225
up, I think, at a, something for
work or something had

264
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:55,545
a appointment or something.

265
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:56,535
And so I couldn't make it.

266
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:59,175
And then I, I think the next one
you had, I said,

267
00:12:59,175 --> 00:12:59,985
Hey, I'm free again.

268
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,765
And I, I just basically
contacted you out of the blue.

269
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,825
I, I think I sent you a DM or I
responded directly

270
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,395
in the tweak cause.

271
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,145
Because we weren't following
each other at the time,

272
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:14,565
but, um, it was pretty much
that, you know, uh, I.

273
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:17,444
I'm a, I'm a pretty sociable
person.

274
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:21,194
And like outside of, I mean, I'm
working full remote now,

275
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:25,125
even pre pandemic, but you know,
I'll go out for drinks,

276
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,125
grab coffee with friends, or,
you know, do stuff.

277
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,675
Um, and.

278
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,145
Obviously cuz of the pandemic,
not a lot of that is happening

279
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,525
or none of it is happening.

280
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:39,995
So I was just like, I dunno, I
was just like, Yolo,

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,645
you know, Hey, whatever, let's
go check it out.

282
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,915
And, uh, it was one of the best
things that happened

283
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,945
to me in 2020, honestly, uh, met
a lot of great.

284
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:52,645
Folks like your both view and
just, I really enjoy the

285
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:55,944
community and it's, it's kind of
really cool to see how

286
00:13:55,944 --> 00:14:00,175
it's grown and because we know
each other a lot better now,

287
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:03,625
too, you know, it's because
those initial conversations

288
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,594
in a, in the Virtual Coffee, or
like the slack chat, you

289
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,204
know, people don't really know
how people are, so

290
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:11,214
it's, uh, but you can tell.

291
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,949
People people know who's who
now.

292
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:14,670
So it's.

293
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,810
Yeah, no, I just love it.

294
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,100
Bekah: Yeah.

295
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,449
I, I love it too.

296
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:23,910
And who knew, who knew that, you
know, in, in April I

297
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:30,199
would, um, lose my job because
Dan would fire me and then

298
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,760
Nick: I didn't fire you.

299
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,745
Bekah: I mean, it's, it's
semantics, right?

300
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,475
Like I work for Dan's important
semantics.

301
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:44,205
Dan was like, Hey, we don't have
work anymore.

302
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:46,005
So call it what you want.

303
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:52,145
Um, Uh, but yeah, like it
started there and it

304
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,335
was like, okay, well I need to
be around people.

305
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,375
And now we're recording a
podcast.

306
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:56,675
Right?

307
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:57,965
Like nowhere in my mind.

308
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:01,295
Did I ever think that this was
gonna be where we would be,

309
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:03,185
you know, eight months later?

310
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,365
Yeah,

311
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:05,075
Nick: yeah.

312
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,035
No, a lot of stuff.

313
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,925
I mean, the podcast is amazing.

314
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:10,145
Uh, we we've been doing brown
bags.

315
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:13,835
Uh, we just did, the lightning
talks was last Thursday, right?

316
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:14,245
Yeah.

317
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:14,445
Friday.

318
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:15,675
I think yeah.

319
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:16,125
Friday.

320
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:16,515
Yeah.

321
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:21,045
Um, yeah, so just lots of stuff
going on and it's, uh, you know,

322
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,775
people are always like, Hey,
let's try this or let's do this.

323
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,415
Or, you know, or if somebody
brings up something like, oh,

324
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,734
that'd be a good brown bag.

325
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:28,185
You know?

326
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:31,844
So, uh, I think it's, it's just
been a, just a

327
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:34,155
really cool experience for
everybody, you know, like,

328
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,765
because it's kind of like a.

329
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:39,735
Almost like a mini Twitter or
it's, it's a, it's a

330
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:41,115
mini commun basically.

331
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:43,455
So, uh, it's kind of nice.

332
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:44,505
Yeah.

333
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:44,915
You know?

334
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:46,005
Dan: Yeah.

335
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,035
That like size of it is, is one
of my, I don't know one

336
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,225
of the things I like too, that
sort of what everybody

337
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:52,665
kind of knows each other, like
you were saying.

338
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,015
Yeah, it's been cool.

339
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:54,615
It's been cool.

340
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:58,365
Kind of being around, you know,
since, since it, like, since it

341
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:01,275
started, you know, seeing kind
of everybody become close, but

342
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,265
you know, grow a little bit too.

343
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:03,295
Nick: Yeah.

344
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,765
Yeah, for sure.

345
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,295
Bekah: Yeah.

346
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:09,704
And I think, you know, being
able to meet developers, you

347
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:14,444
know, I'm a new developer and
I'm a mom of four kids, so it

348
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,095
is not like I get out that much.

349
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:16,334
Right.

350
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,704
Like my kids are young, so
people are like go to meetups

351
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,355
and meet people or conferences.

352
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,125
And, you know, it's only doable
for, um, so many people.

353
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:25,605
Right.

354
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,915
And that was not something that
was doable for me.

355
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,685
And so I missed that community,
a.

356
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:36,180
I learned online in a like
self-paced program and

357
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,650
there wasn't that community.

358
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,220
And so like finding people here
at all stages has been such a

359
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,410
great way to learn and grow.

360
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,340
Dan: Yeah.

361
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,590
Yeah.

362
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,140
The other thing about going to,
uh, like events and

363
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,180
stuff is they're, they're just
like they come and go,

364
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,840
you know, and then it's.

365
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:53,565
I don't know.

366
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:53,715
Yeah.

367
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,035
But sometimes you make friends,
you know, but

368
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,295
most of the time not

369
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:57,075
Right.

370
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:59,895
Uh, so they, even if it's a
great event and then

371
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,055
when you go home, it's, I don't
know, then you're

372
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,495
back to your job and stuff.

373
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:07,005
Um, that's one of the like, nice
things about this, this

374
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,085
sort of ongoing community.

375
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:08,086
Yeah.

376
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,025
Nick: Yeah, I find it's
consistent, cuz like we meet,

377
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:14,835
I mean, for those who don't
know, we, we have two Virtual

378
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,825
Coffees, uh, one on Tuesdays and
Thursdays and I typically

379
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,444
try to go to both of them.

380
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:23,625
I usually I miss a Tuesday one
if I have an all hands

381
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,165
meeting for work, cuz I, I work
in a distributed company.

382
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,655
So like cuz the time zones we
alternate.

383
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,580
The time of the all hands on the
Tuesday and sometimes

384
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,700
it's on Wednesday, but, uh, so I
think like once every

385
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,780
three weeks I have to miss a
Virtual Coffee, but, uh, I look

386
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,150
forward to them and I, and I
feel kind of down when I miss

387
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,130
one  it sounds kind of funny.

388
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,110
It's like, uh, I dunno.

389
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,360
Like crack cocaine.

390
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,600
I don't know.

391
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,960
Bekah: um, there have been a
couple of times where I, I

392
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,490
thought I was gonna miss and it
was like, I'm, I'm gonna miss.

393
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,460
And then I would like log in
from my phone or

394
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,750
rush home or whatever.

395
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,640
Um, so I've been super excited
to make all of them except

396
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,320
this week is Thanksgiving.

397
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,960
So I think I will be missing my
first one,

398
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,890
American Thanksgiving.

399
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:12,834
Um, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,594
But, but don't worry.

401
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:18,915
The show will go on and we will
have a, a host for everybody.

402
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:22,905
Um, Nick, I wanna dig into a
little bit of some of the cool

403
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:24,495
stuff that I think you're doing.

404
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:28,514
Um, you have been really great
with our community.

405
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,834
We did the hack Tober Fest
initiative where we.

406
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,490
Um, worked with community
members to, uh, work on HEC

407
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,790
Tober Fest, where they're trying
to get, uh, four pool requests

408
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,190
into open source projects.

409
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:47,870
And we set up mentorship and we
worked with maintainers

410
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:51,985
and, um, And the contributors as
well, and you pretty

411
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:55,165
much played a role in all three
of those things.

412
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:57,865
Um, you contributed to my open
source project.

413
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:00,235
And I wanna say like, I, that
was really great to

414
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,875
have somebody who has a good
idea and understanding of

415
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,895
what it's like to, um, be an
open source maintainer.

416
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,175
And so.

417
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,850
You contributed to my project
and at the same time,

418
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,070
mentored me as a maintainer.

419
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,310
um, and I just wanna say, first
of all, thank you.

420
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,820
And second of all, um, can you
talk a little bit about

421
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,420
your experience in open source
and the things that you've

422
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,250
learned and maybe some things
that, um, contributors and

423
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,660
maintainers can kind of learn.

424
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,620
Nick: Yeah, for sure.

425
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:37,980
Um, I got into open source in,
it was either 20.

426
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,149
I think it was 2015, maybe 2016,
but I, I think

427
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,620
it was like late 2015.

428
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,595
I, uh, It was, I'd never
contributed to

429
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,525
open source at all.

430
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:52,645
At that point, I didn't know,
get, because I was

431
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:58,825
working in the.net ecosystem
and@thetimelikemicrosoftisopensourcenowintermsofthe.net

432
00:19:58,885 --> 00:19:59,995
framework and all that.

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,595
And, uh, they've.

434
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,290
They've they used it heavily
now, but prior to that, I was

435
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,450
in other, uh, source control,
um, systems like, uh, for

436
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,670
those who are really old, there
was one from Microsoft

437
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,300
called visual source safe, which
got corrupt all the time.

438
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,870
And so like, your, your code
base would sometimes just kind

439
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:25,180
of go in the dumpster, but, um,
worked in like SVN and then

440
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,840
TFS, which is team foundation
server from Microsoft.

441
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,100
So.

442
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,550
The first thing that was.

443
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,794
The way it happened was I was
like, this was kind

444
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:39,824
of my, I wanna really just focus
on front end.

445
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,764
And I had started messing around
with media.

446
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:46,125
Media is like a, it's a
universal JavaScript framework.

447
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,304
It's, it's changed a bit over
the years, uh, for those who

448
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:53,355
are in the react ecosystem,
Apollo like GraphQL that

449
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,615
actually came from media.

450
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:57,435
Um, um, and then some other
projects.

451
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Uh, I was like, yeah, I'm gonna
mess around with this.

452
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,090
So it was like literally
JavaScript everywhere.

453
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,669
It was MongoDB for the database.

454
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,760
You'd write code on the front
end and JavaScript obviously,

455
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,340
and note in the back end.

456
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,070
And then you could also have
certain parts of the

457
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,959
code that you could share that
could be used server

458
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,189
side and client side.

459
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,919
So maybe something, for example,
like client side

460
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,600
validation, you could do it on.

461
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,710
Well, not just client side
validation, validation, you

462
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:25,700
could do it on both sides.

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,830
So I, I just started messing
around with that.

464
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,100
And then, but I really didn't
know anything about it.

465
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,940
And.

466
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,770
I forget where I saw this
posted.

467
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,990
It was on some message board.

468
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,360
I, I really can't remember where
I think it

469
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,139
actually might have been.

470
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,530
I think media at the time had
job boards or like some kind

471
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,790
of community board, maybe.

472
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,139
I, I think that's where it came
from.

473
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,189
Somebody from San Francisco who
I did not know, just said,

474
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,590
uh, I have a paying gig for.

475
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:55,034
Media and it's working in open
source.

476
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:59,925
And I just said yes, even though
I didn't  didn't know

477
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:03,195
it really, uh, this, this is
kind of where my journey

478
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:05,115
of structured Yolo begins.

479
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,625
Um, so yeah, I just said, yeah.

480
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,284
And then I met up with him, uh,
uh, we ended up being

481
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:13,485
a team of five people.

482
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,855
We were working on this really
cool application

483
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:17,055
that was called push pickup.

484
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:17,865
So it.

485
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,570
It was web tech, but the idea
was to make it a mobile app.

486
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,660
And it was like, if you wanna
play basketball, you can

487
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,050
just find friends around you
and, and organize a game.

488
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,140
Cuz there's, there's several
sports platforms.

489
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,240
Now I think to do this kind of
thing, but this was

490
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,670
like, it just seemed like a
better way of doing it.

491
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,710
And so that was the project.

492
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,370
And then.

493
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,110
I remember, like I got some code
working and I'm like,

494
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,320
okay, first poll request ever.

495
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,790
Uh, I I'm like, I gotta make it
perfect all this stuff.

496
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,860
And of course it wasn't perfect.

497
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:53,030
I messed something up.

498
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,080
And then this is pre like
prettier days and ES Lynn.

499
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,060
So then there was a lot of, can
you change this

500
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,260
formatting and stuff too?

501
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,700
So basically.

502
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:05,595
It wasn't a disaster, but it was
like not great.

503
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:10,095
Um, but you know, uh, continuing
on with the structured Yolo,

504
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,335
I just kept going and just kept
contributing and, and

505
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:19,395
then I react was out at the time
it came well, react came

506
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,245
out in 2013, I believe at.

507
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:26,505
The F eight conference or was it
2015?

508
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,165
I can't remember.

509
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,485
Um, anyways, uh, react was like
the hot new thing and I was

510
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,655
like, I need to learn react.

511
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,225
So, uh, like I've mentioned to
you before, I'm not really

512
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,545
good at starting projects.

513
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:39,855
I'm good at jumping onto
projects.

514
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,515
So I found this, uh, react
boiler.

515
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,330
Boiler plate project that used
Redux, uh, it was called react.

516
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,440
Slingshot still exists in a, uh,
is by Cory house.

517
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,270
Who's a react consultant.

518
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,800
He's I would say he's.

519
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,980
I mean, it depends whenever I
think people are well known.

520
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,780
Like a lot of people are like, I
have no idea who

521
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,970
you're talking about, but he
seems to be, he's pretty

522
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,830
active in the react ecosystem.

523
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,240
He used to do a lot of.net.

524
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,070
He's a plural site author, all
that stuff.

525
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,870
So I just started contribut.

526
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:15,510
and I think after my 13th poll
request, he's like, oh, Hey, uh,

527
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,350
do you wanna become a maintainer
and, and small world, this

528
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,090
is also how I met Kyle Welch.

529
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,879
He's actually a maintainer on
there as well.

530
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,080
So that's, that was my kind of
first kind of deep dive into.

531
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,595
I mean post post the media
project.

532
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:35,925
Um, and it was cool that I was
asked to be a maintainer and I

533
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:39,105
was just like, you know what,
I'm just gonna say yes, cuz I

534
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,245
just thought it was interesting.

535
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,165
And there was three of us on the
project.

536
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,985
So, so this is like kind of one
of the first points

537
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,955
of like, if you're working in
open source, uh, Ken

538
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,455
Dodds does this very well.

539
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:50,564
He will.

540
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:54,165
He'll create really great
projects, but Kent see,

541
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:55,695
DODs does not scale.

542
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:59,564
Nobody scales like at, at the
level of when

543
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,564
people are, are asking for
fixing things and stuff.

544
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:05,804
So typically at least from what
I've seen, Kent will make

545
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,534
like a great project, like his
most recent one, like the

546
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,215
whole testing library stuff.

547
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,435
Um, and then he'll, I.

548
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,695
Typically, what he'll do is kind
of what I mentioned is

549
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,395
people start contributing and he
probably, he just

550
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,075
asked him, Hey, do you wanna
become a maintainer?

551
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,505
And then all of a sudden you're
scaling because

552
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,575
you have all these other
maintainers and they're people

553
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,215
that are interested in the
project, cuz they were most

554
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,535
likely contributing to it.

555
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:34,110
So, um, So that's kind of like
story slash also first advice

556
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,230
about if, if you wanna create a
project, that's, you know,

557
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,920
I, if it's your own personal
project, you know, maybe that's

558
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,860
not something you need right
now, but as soon as your thing

559
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,740
potentially gets popular or
start, or you notice it's

560
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,190
starting to pick up steam it's I
would say it's definitely

561
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,330
a good idea to at least.

562
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:54,690
One of the folks that contribute
to your project

563
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,860
to become a maintainer.

564
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,379
Um, and yeah, that was, there
was that.

565
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:01,860
And then there was.

566
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,690
Little other bits, like, uh, I
wrote a post about

567
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,700
this, but like even
documentation's important.

568
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,820
And I remember in 2016, when I
was working at this

569
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,980
FinTech, uh, we were working in
electron and I was trying to do

570
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,090
something and it wasn't working.

571
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,680
And then I realized there was an
error in the

572
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,150
documentation and electron.

573
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,030
So mm-hmm,  just, I started
doing like little poll

574
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,590
requests, stuff like that.

575
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:25,770
I

576
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,870
Bekah: wanna like, just pause
for a second

577
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,470
because I think that.

578
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:30,504
Gave us so much great
information.

579
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:33,294
And I like wanna make sure that
that all of this

580
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:34,554
stuff gets highlighted.

581
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:39,054
One of the things that I find
like super inspirational, I

582
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,405
love your, um, Structured Yolo.

583
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:43,725
Nick: Yeah.

584
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:43,995
Structured.

585
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:44,525
Yeah.

586
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,225
Yeah.

587
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,545
I coined that last week.

588
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:47,745
I forget what way, but

589
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:48,685
Bekah: yeah.

590
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:49,425
And that's great.

591
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,475
Like, I, I think that's
wonderful because I think for

592
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,235
a lot of new developers or
probably like just lots of

593
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:59,925
developers in general, like
there's this fear of trying

594
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:02,025
something out and failing right.

595
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:05,265
Or of, you know, not doing it
right.

596
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:07,095
Or like, I remember when I.

597
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:11,285
Started working like my husband
is a developer too, and I would.

598
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:13,935
Type out a message.

599
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,675
And then I'd be like, can I read
this to you?

600
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,264
Does it make sense at all?

601
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,784
Like, am I saying the things in
the right ways?

602
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:20,145
Right.

603
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:24,225
You know, cause you're learning
an entirely new vocabulary,

604
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:29,864
but I think that getting over
that hump and that fear of not.

605
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,790
Saying it right or not doing the
poor request, right.

606
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,330
Is like half of the battle to
becoming more confident

607
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,820
as a developer and like that
attitude of structured Yolo, um,

608
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,220
I think really would benefit.

609
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,680
I like, I want your structured
Yolo course.

610
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,040
So when you drop that, can you
let us know?

611
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,720
And we'll put it out there for
everybody.

612
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:57,135
Nick: yeah, my, uh, masterclass
along with, uh,

613
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,255
Tom Morelo from rag gain some
machines, guitar class.

614
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:00,675
Yep, sure.

615
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:01,035
Bekah: No problem.

616
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:01,155
Yep.

617
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:01,545
Right there.

618
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:02,775
I want it.

619
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:05,055
Um, but I think that that's
great.

620
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:09,975
And I think that's really
helpful to hear your story about

621
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,975
that and to hear like, Hey, like
you might not have gotten it.

622
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:13,605
Perfect.

623
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,695
And, but also like you're
talking about.

624
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,020
You're you're using, um, this
open source project

625
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,540
and they didn't get it right in
the documentation

626
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,740
or something changed.

627
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,070
Right.

628
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,060
And I think that also as a new
developer, there's this tendency

629
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,430
to believe that everything that
you see on the screen is

630
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:31,960
the right way of doing things.

631
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,389
But sometimes things change.

632
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:38,024
Or sometimes it's, it's not
documented, right.

633
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:40,185
Or, you know, a better way of
doing things.

634
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:44,054
And so, you know, realizing that
you have value in

635
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,245
where you are at your stage is
really important too.

636
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:47,925
And I think that you captured
that a lot.

637
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:50,054
Nick: Oh, thanks.

638
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,274
Thanks.

639
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:50,895
Yeah.

640
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,725
That's the other thing, because
all these

641
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:53,745
things are open source.

642
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,735
It's like, it, it, the software
is not perfect.

643
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,594
Like there there's tons of great
projects.

644
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:01,544
I don't, I'm not, I I'm not, I
don't mean that in a

645
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,495
negative way, but like I've.

646
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,340
I've ran into issues like, uh,
with Webpack, for example,

647
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,190
it ended up being my fault, but
because the code was

648
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,840
open source, I, I was able to
literally debug in the

649
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,570
Webpack code because when you
install Webpack, it goes in

650
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,880
your node models and it's, it's
literally all the source code.

651
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,200
So you can actually.

652
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,540
Debugging in that cause like I
was, I had this

653
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,570
Webpac loader for anybody that's
familiar with Webpac.

654
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,780
Um, and it wasn't doing what it
was supposed to.

655
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,410
And then, because I was able to
go in the code and step through,

656
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,310
I, I actually figured out that
the, the configuration options

657
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:39,690
for that loader were wrong.

658
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,660
Like I had done something wrong
and I, I probably didn't read

659
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,710
the documentation probably.

660
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,850
So that's probably my bad too.

661
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,990
But, um, I, I think that's the
cool thing about open source,

662
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:54,330
uh, you know, uh, It just
helping, you know, there's,

663
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,320
there's another side to it.

664
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,280
There's the whole burnout thing,
which is a whole other topic.

665
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,240
Uh, I personally haven't
experienced it because.

666
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,015
One where I am now.

667
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:07,935
It's like, my job is to work in
opensource.

668
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:09,415
Like I'm paid to work in
opensource.

669
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,395
So it's, it's not like, like,
you know, when like Sebastian

670
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,335
McKenzie who created babble, uh,
used to be, uh, six to five,

671
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:22,485
the project, but like, it was
literally just him initially.

672
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:25,635
And then he abandoned the
project because he, he

673
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:28,725
literally got so burnt out
because it's babble is like,

674
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:33,675
literally in probably any modern
front end project.

675
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:36,675
Like it, like it's everywhere,
you know?

676
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:41,745
And so, but that, that ties into
getting more maintainers into

677
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:43,544
your project as well, you know?

678
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:47,655
Um, but at the end of the day,
too, you know, and I talk about

679
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:50,745
this in my talk, getting the
most outta open source that

680
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:56,264
I did for Octoberfest is, you
know, a lot of people it's,

681
00:30:56,325 --> 00:31:01,095
you know, Take take take, or
just like, you know, this

682
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:04,995
doesn't work, fix it, or why
isn't this merged yet, yet?

683
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:08,415
It's like people sometimes
forget that there's people

684
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:10,455
behind the projects, you know?

685
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:13,064
So you have to, like, one of the
things they talk about

686
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,034
is like, like, don't forget, you
know, like somebody might

687
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:18,915
be on vacation, they might be
sick, you know, like they're

688
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:20,955
doing it on their own time, you
know, unless it's a.

689
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,169
Project or like some kind of
Patreon or like it's

690
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:27,570
your actual job to be paid to
work in open source.

691
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,969
So, you know, it's just stuff.

692
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:32,159
I think that folks forget
sometimes, you know, and

693
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,320
like, and one of my favorite.

694
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:37,725
Things to do is if anybody's
ever snarky is you can

695
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:39,495
just say, oh, thanks.

696
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,534
You know, would you like to
create a poll request

697
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:46,125
or , you know, so you're not,
it, it's kind of like a, a

698
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,635
nice, a funny way to sh to kind
of shut down an asshole.

699
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:49,905
Yeah.

700
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:51,345
I look forward to your poll
request.

701
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:52,865
yeah, yeah, exactly.

702
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:57,915
So, uh, you know, But yeah, no,

703
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,735
Dan: it's, uh, I think that
what, what you're saying about

704
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:04,005
remembering people are behind,
you know, is, is important.

705
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:10,215
And I, I feel like, um, another
thing that I have like been,

706
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:12,615
I don't know, trying to figure
out how to sort of communicate

707
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,195
to people is remembering that
like, just because somebody

708
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,345
has been a developer for a long
time doesn't mean that they.

709
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:22,235
Know everything or are better
or, you know, like experts or

710
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:23,074
anything, you know what I mean?

711
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,324
And so, like, it's sort of what
Bekah was saying before.

712
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:27,665
Like, you know, just like
learning to trust yourself,

713
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,965
um, and your judgment, you know,
as you, as you and your

714
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,595
abilities as you, uh, become a
more experienced developer,

715
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,875
you know, I, I feel like is one
of those like big steps,

716
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,095
big, important steps, um, and
something that I've been

717
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:42,510
trying to figure out how to help
people with, you know, As

718
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,370
they start out, you know, as
they start out their career.

719
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,480
Nick: Um, for sure.

720
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,510
Cuz like a lot of it could just
be like from experience

721
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,389
you like you, you know, certain
things because they've

722
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,610
happened to you, but like you.

723
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:58,335
I'm, I'm not really good at
animations, but it's

724
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,825
because I haven't really had to
ever really do them.

725
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,475
It's not because I'm horrible at
them.

726
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:04,665
It's just, I haven't had enough
time to really

727
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:05,565
dedicate it to it.

728
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,635
But I think, I think what you
get better at too is Scott.

729
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,755
I'm dropping like names here,
but like Scott Hanson

730
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,135
gave a, a great talk.

731
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,800
Code land this year.

732
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,889
And he's just talking about cuz
he's, he's been in the space

733
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:21,510
for like a long, long time.

734
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,500
And he was just saying like, you
get better, you know, he

735
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,020
wasn't saying why I'm better
than you, but I, I can't

736
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,149
remember exactly how he said,
but he's, he's basically said

737
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm older now I have experience,
but I know how to Google

738
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,040
better than you, you know?

739
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,690
So like, cuz it's true.

740
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,850
Like half the time, like you'll
get an error.

741
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,379
It's like you're gonna paste in
that error.

742
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,480
You're gonna go see almost
always.

743
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,170
Somebody's had that error.

744
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,800
You get the occasional, like,
you know, Russian site with

745
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,010
one hit where it's like that
error and you have no idea

746
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,890
but uh, nothing get Russia.

747
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,180
It's just it's happening yet.

748
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,630
So many times that it's like
one, one hit on a Russian site.

749
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:01,450
I don't know why, but, um, but
yeah, no,

750
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,290
that's, that's the thing.

751
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,480
And nobody's ever gonna know
everything.

752
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,210
Like, you know, it'd be kind of.

753
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,090
Well, you know, it'd be kind of
a little presumptuous that, you

754
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,510
know, everything too, you know,
like, like the whole know it all

755
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,480
thing it's like, I think your
brain would probably explode if

756
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,710
you did know everything anyway.

757
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,040
So

758
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,250
Bekah: I think that's why, you
know, it's so important

759
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:26,520
to have this community of people
that are at.

760
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,990
All stages of the journey,
right.

761
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,160
Um, because you learn a lot from
seeing other people talk about

762
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,290
how they don't know something
or, you know, Molly STR I

763
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:41,800
think tweeted once about, um,
bringing new people on board.

764
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,830
And one of the things she does
is talk about like, okay, this

765
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,290
is a thing that I messed up last
week or something like that.

766
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,379
And that just kind of, yeah.

767
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:49,419
Yeah.

768
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,279
You know, if you're allowed to
admit your failures, I think,

769
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:55,409
and well, okay, so maybe it's
not called failure, right?

770
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,089
Like  you're yeah.

771
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,120
If you're allowed to admit
things that didn't go right

772
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,060
the first time, then, then
you're better able to learn

773
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,100
and grow from that experience.

774
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:07,985
And I think also like your live
streaming goals

775
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:09,395
in line with that too.

776
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:09,845
Right.

777
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:13,595
Because there's kind of a lot at
stake, but I feel like you

778
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:18,185
make things very accessible and
you make it friendly to a

779
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,855
lot of different people because
you're willing to put yourself

780
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,145
out there and live stream.

781
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,695
So, um, can you talk about that
a little bit?

782
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:26,555
Nick: Yeah.

783
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,285
Yeah, for sure.

784
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:31,305
Uh, I started live streaming in
April this year.

785
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:35,174
Once again, pandemic 2020 is a
dumpster fire.

786
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:39,015
And I was like, uh, I don't
know.

787
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:41,475
It kind of ties into, uh, SWS.

788
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:43,964
Uh, Sean Wang's like learn in
public and,

789
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,710
um, It's kind of cool.

790
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,810
Actually, I got to interview him
a couple weeks ago,

791
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,900
which was kind of nice too, but,
um, but yeah, it just

792
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,820
started live streaming mainly.

793
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,890
And I was literally doing like
my real work.

794
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:57,960
It wasn't like, this is my side
project.

795
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,290
I was doing my actual work, live
streaming and

796
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,990
my own account on Twitch.

797
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,760
I don't have a lot of followers.

798
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,940
I've got like a hundred
something, but I was.

799
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,590
Talking to myself.

800
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,550
Like I, I found the live
streaming helped me articulate

801
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,280
either like rubber ducking, the,
the screen basically.

802
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,940
And so I'd be talking about my
whole thought process and stuff.

803
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,900
And, and then, then I got the
idea, which I don't

804
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,840
think is, uh, like a, a new idea
or anything, but

805
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,200
I was like, why don't I.

806
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:34,154
Tried pairing with folks in the
community to pair on

807
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:35,775
issues in the forum code base.

808
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:42,015
And so I just sent out a tweet
and then spoke to my work and

809
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:43,005
they said like, yeah, yeah.

810
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:43,305
That's yeah.

811
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,085
That's that's cool.

812
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:44,685
Go ahead.

813
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,865
Um, and this was initially all
on my Twitch account.

814
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:51,810
Um, I had done one with Sophia
Lee.

815
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,000
Uh, who's in the community.

816
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,589
I did one with Chuck Smith.

817
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,189
Who's in our Virtual Coffee, Nia
Jackson as well.

818
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:03,180
And, um, I think those were the
first three I did.

819
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,129
And that was still on my own
stream.

820
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:07,979
And then this was getting close
to Octoberfest.

821
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:12,475
And I was actually running, not
running.

822
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:16,435
I was like my, my main job for
the month of hack

823
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,035
Octoberfest was to work on hack
Octoberfest for dev slash forum.

824
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:23,485
So me and Christina Gordon, my
other coworker, who's

825
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,445
our community manager.

826
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:28,195
Um, I, I pitched the idea to
Jess.

827
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:29,785
One of the co-founders they
said, well, why

828
00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:33,985
don't we do pairing for
Octoberfest fast and.

829
00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:36,080
then we got some other ideas
too.

830
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,910
Like, uh, it was, I think, uh, I
just thought walk through

831
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,290
Wednesdays sounded cool.

832
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,080
So then I, I was like, we'll
just start interviewing people.

833
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,490
And so like, it started off with
some of our team members and

834
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,700
I'm still interviewing some of
our team members, but also just

835
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,440
people in the dev community.

836
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,890
Uh, and this kind of ties into
my structured Joel.

837
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,750
I'm just like, I have nothing to
lose.

838
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,230
I'm just gonna.

839
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:04,205
People who I would like to
interview if they wanna come on.

840
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,215
And they, they said yes.

841
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,475
So that's kind of cool.

842
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:08,075
So it's.

843
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,170
Had like Sean w like I said, uh,
recently, uh,

844
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,170
spoke with somebody from the MPM
GitHub team last week.

845
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,540
RUO Eve Portello of GraphQL fame
react.

846
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:22,530
She's coming on.

847
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,140
Uh, I don't know if I'm saying
her name correctly,

848
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:28,940
but Vinny Che, she runs
diversified tech she's

849
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:31,380
coming on and GA coming on.

850
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,540
Jerome Hardaway from, uh, SSU
code.

851
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,410
I dunno.

852
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,710
It's just kind of cool, like,
uh, and just to be

853
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,410
able to do that's kind of fun,
but, uh, yeah, we did

854
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,240
more live, live coding.

855
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,190
Uh, and like you said, it's,
it's not set up to succeed.

856
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,310
Like it's set up to succeed in
the sense, like, yes, we're

857
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,940
gonna have fun and stuff, but
like the whole, the whole goal

858
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,460
of the, the live pairings is.

859
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,090
It's not that I'm trying to make
it as realistic as

860
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,710
possible, but like in real life,
like you get an issue.

861
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,690
You're gonna start looking up
stuff.

862
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,140
You're gonna start trying to
figure things out and

863
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,820
you're not necessarily.

864
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,340
Gonna figure it out in like an
hour and a half,

865
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,470
which is typically what we do
for the stream.

866
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,400
So, you know, uh, I always tell
folks at the beginning,

867
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,190
you know, like, uh, they
introduce themselves and

868
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,950
stuff, but I, I stress that
we're here to have fun.

869
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,250
Just get you introduced to the
code base, uh, you know,

870
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,660
uh, Before or after help them,
if they're new to open

871
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,440
source to, you know, create a
branch, create a poll request,

872
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,390
follow up after as well.

873
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,110
You know, and, and there's some
prep too, like, uh, getting

874
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,170
them set up with the code base
and we have some talks as well.

875
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:53,190
Uh, um, so yeah, I've, I've just
really been enjoying

876
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,020
it for many reasons.

877
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,860
One it's I.

878
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:57,815
Engaging with the community.

879
00:39:57,815 --> 00:40:03,425
And I also like the element of,
I don't know if this is gonna

880
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:07,565
work or not  and like I've been
even doing some Ruby live code

881
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:09,665
pairing, which I don't really
have a lot of experience in,

882
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:10,925
so that's kind of fun too.

883
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:14,825
So, uh, yeah, it's, uh, that's,
that's my structured

884
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,205
Yolo kind of in a nutshell.

885
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:16,535
So.

886
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:18,465
That's awesome.

887
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:18,795
Bekah: Yeah.

888
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:19,395
I love that.

889
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:23,625
And I think that that's great
for, for everybody to hear.

890
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:27,165
And I do love how you use, like
this person centered approach.

891
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,925
I think like when you're doing
this, right, like you're

892
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:33,435
meeting people as human beings
where they're at and it's

893
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,965
not this high pressure thing.

894
00:40:34,995 --> 00:40:35,265
Right.

895
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:38,655
It gives everybody the ability
to learn and to grow.

896
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:39,555
And I think that's really.

897
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,490
Nick: Yeah.

898
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,279
And it's, it's interesting too,
because like on the

899
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:48,000
live stream, there's, uh,
there's chat in Twitch.

900
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:51,540
Like we put 'em on YouTube
after, but uh, so people

901
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,399
from the community will actually
interact too.

902
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:54,660
Oh, did you try this?

903
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,339
Like do this, you know, so
there's, it's, it's pair

904
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:03,509
programming, but kind of like
slightly mob programming, a

905
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:06,419
bit to the certain degree,
depending on the, the stream,

906
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,220
I guess, but, uh, yeah.

907
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,150
Yeah,

908
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,170
Bekah: that's great.

909
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,660
Um, we've got a couple of
questions from the Virtual

910
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,000
Coffee community that I wanna
make sure that I ask.

911
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,670
Uh, the first one is, can you
talk about your

912
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,870
funniest bug or your biggest
whoops moment, or maybe

913
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,890
that's a time you took down

914
00:41:22,895 --> 00:41:23,220
Nick: prod?

915
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,430
Uh, yeah, I, I didn't.

916
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:29,040
Take down.

917
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,470
Well, I guess I somewhat took
down pride.

918
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Um, I was doing my first
deployment at a smaller

919
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,649
company in like 2009.

920
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,700
And it was my, like I said, my
first deployment, this is like

921
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:50,520
pre, there was no real like CI
cd@thetimeiwasusingsomethingcalledcruisecontrol.net,

922
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:50,970
which is.

923
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:54,294
It's like a task runner, but
like a lot of the stuff

924
00:41:54,294 --> 00:42:00,855
I'd done custom, like stuff,
but, um, I was getting ready.

925
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:02,235
I had my checklist.

926
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:04,785
I go, okay, let's upgrade the
database.

927
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:07,395
And like, I don't remember what
happened, but like I

928
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:08,835
literally locked the database.

929
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:10,065
Like the first thing I did.

930
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,985
So like basically the entire
deploy was

931
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,005
botched at that point.

932
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:14,445
And.

933
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:17,415
The DBA, the database
administrator that I

934
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,174
worked with, we'd worked in
other places before, too.

935
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:24,285
She just kinda laughed and kind
of did a disk, but she's

936
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:26,595
like, she's kind of like, yeah,
move out of the way.

937
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,734
Let me start this out for you.

938
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:33,915
So, uh, so that, there's that,
um, another place which was.

939
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,390
It, it wasn't my fault, but it
was still a very

940
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,710
interesting scenario.

941
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,270
Um, I was working at, uh, the
eCommerce company and we had a

942
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,790
client, a fairly large company.

943
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,660
So like, I think about 40,000,
maybe 60,000

944
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,009
folks with single sign on.

945
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,740
And I was working on the
project, which was the

946
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,120
single sign-on project.

947
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,805
And we had this custom single
sign-on, uh, Thing initially.

948
00:43:02,805 --> 00:43:06,255
And then we migrated to a out of
the, off the

949
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,415
shelf, uh, solution, cuz it just
made sense.

950
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,925
Let people who know, you know,
authentication

951
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,625
authorizing, let you know, let,
let them handle that.

952
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:18,915
So we had our development
environment, our tests

953
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:20,895
and staging environment and then
production.

954
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:27,225
So got tested it through every
part of the process, get to

955
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:30,165
production and uh, I run.

956
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:35,685
And all of a sudden, the sign on
is in infinite loop.

957
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:39,134
Um, and this is like for, for,
it's not, it

958
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:41,865
wasn't OWA for anybody that's
familiar with SAML.

959
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,145
So it's like Ws Federation.

960
00:43:44,145 --> 00:43:47,384
It's just a little more
complicated, but basically,

961
00:43:47,384 --> 00:43:49,424
yeah, the thing was spinning
like crazy and

962
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,990
I'm like, We're deploying.

963
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,470
These are like, this was a large
SharePoint application

964
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,339
and this takes like the deploys
were like a long time.

965
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,810
Uh, we, we typically did it from
like 5:00 PM to like two in the

966
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,310
morning or three in the morning.

967
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:05,029
And.

968
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,564
It's like one in the morning,
this thing's happening.

969
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,444
I'm like, oh my God, you know,
checked everything.

970
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:15,685
And like I said, every stage of
the process was fine.

971
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:19,435
Dev tests, staging, no issues
whatsoever.

972
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:22,254
I get on the phone with their
technical support.

973
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,904
We're trying to figure it out,
you know?

974
00:44:23,904 --> 00:44:29,245
And in the end it turned out
that the software had.

975
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:34,754
You can do in, in, in, in, uh, C
sharp, you can kind

976
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,734
of have conditional stuff.

977
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:40,214
Like if I'm in debug mode, do
something.

978
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:45,585
And, uh, there was something
that was in one of those, like,

979
00:44:47,265 --> 00:44:51,975
If debug, uh, it was, it was, I
think it was logging something

980
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,455
and it was preventing this
infinite loop from happening.

981
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:59,115
So when we were in development
test and staging, no issues

982
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:02,205
at all, but production, it wa I,
I think it was

983
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:03,345
like a log or something.

984
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:05,444
And it's because it didn't do
that step.

985
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:08,865
Like maybe it was like, just to
prevent like a,

986
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:11,055
uh, you know, like a.

987
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,984
What's the, I'm drawing a blank
here, uh, like a race condition.

988
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:15,645
Yeah.

989
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:16,004
Thank you.

990
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:16,455
Thank you.

991
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,174
Yeah.

992
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:19,545
So I think it was preventing a
race condition, even

993
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,404
though they didn't realize.

994
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,115
So we figured that out.

995
00:45:23,115 --> 00:45:27,045
So then we had to redeploy and
we redeployed it in debug mode

996
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,654
so that the deploy could finish.

997
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,705
And then after that, you know,
we've filed an issue with the

998
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:35,685
company and then they fixed it
and then everything was

999
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:38,805
fine on the next deploy, but it
was just like high stakes

1000
00:45:38,805 --> 00:45:40,774
at like, you know, and it's.

1001
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,410
One or two in the morning, you
know, like you

1002
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,400
just want to go to bed.

1003
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,470
It was, it was, it was pretty
stressful.

1004
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,410
Um, but that sorted out, so
yeah.

1005
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,650
So those are kind of the two,
those are probably the two

1006
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,060
notable ones I can think of.

1007
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,510
Bekah: um, yeah, that sounds
rough.

1008
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,900
Um, how about kind of the flip
side of this?

1009
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,140
The other question we have is
what is the most excited

1010
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,990
you've ever been about a piece
of code working.

1011
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:09,884
Nick: Uh, I think it's working
well.

1012
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:14,085
It was dev at the time, but
forum, uh, my first,

1013
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,915
I don't know it was cool.

1014
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:18,734
Cuz I contributed to the, I was
actually the first

1015
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:23,024
external contributor to the dev
code base back in 2018.

1016
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:27,254
Uh, so I've been contributing to
the project since 2018,

1017
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:29,955
but uh, or was it 27?

1018
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:30,884
No, it was 2018.

1019
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,685
Um, but.

1020
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:36,915
Uh, when I started working there
in January, the first

1021
00:46:36,915 --> 00:46:41,745
thing I did was we overhauled
the feed and the, if you're

1022
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:45,555
logged in, uh, because you can
personalize it to some degree.

1023
00:46:45,884 --> 00:46:48,525
And it originally was all server
side rendered, cuz

1024
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:49,755
for those who don't know the.

1025
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:53,665
The form code base, it's a
primarily a Rubion rails app.

1026
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,105
And then we sprinkle pre-ACT
wherever it makes sense to

1027
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:00,835
have interactions typically in
the logged in experience.

1028
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:06,145
So I got to do that and then it
just felt really cool knowing

1029
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,405
that once I ship like a feature
that everybody sees, like every

1030
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:14,545
day, uh, was in production and,
you know, like getting

1031
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,885
millions of views every month.

1032
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:18,535
So that, that just felt really
good.

1033
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,535
You know, it's just been fun.

1034
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:24,355
Like anything new I do in there.

1035
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:25,944
It's it's just been a lot of
fun.

1036
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:26,245
So

1037
00:47:26,935 --> 00:47:28,765
Dan: seems like a pretty great
organization,

1038
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:30,265
uh, to, to work with.

1039
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:31,525
Nick: I won't lie.

1040
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:32,694
It's it's pretty awesome.

1041
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,154
Bekah: that's great.

1042
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,605
Well, thanks so much, Nick, for
being here with us.

1043
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:42,985
Um, can you tell, uh, folks what
you're working

1044
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,565
on or where they can find.

1045
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:52,125
Nick: So, uh, I'm at Nicki T
online pretty much everywhere.

1046
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:54,855
GitHub, Twitter, dev two and all
that.

1047
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,435
Um, you can also check out my
website.

1048
00:47:57,525 --> 00:47:59,384
I am developer.com.

1049
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:03,194
I have no idea how I was able to
snag that domain, but I did.

1050
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:06,435
Um, and also, uh, live coding.

1051
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:08,335
If you wanna check that out, you
can go to.

1052
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,790
Live coding.ca I don't know how
I got that one either,

1053
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:16,529
but, um, and Twitch TV slash the
practical dev,

1054
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:19,259
um, for live coding as well.

1055
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,259
Um, and projects right now.

1056
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,270
Um, I guess I've been working on
a few, well, I, for

1057
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,149
Octoberfest, like you said, I
had contributed to yours.

1058
00:48:30,149 --> 00:48:33,390
Uh, I've been working, uh, with
someone who I

1059
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,490
contributed to last year.

1060
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:39,585
Her her, I don't remember her
full name, but her first name's

1061
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:45,884
Ray and she, uh, they have a
Gaby plugin for, uh, Owen beds.

1062
00:48:45,945 --> 00:48:48,915
So I I'm a maintainer on there
now.

1063
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:50,835
So, uh, I've been working on
there too.

1064
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:51,435
So that's fun.

1065
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:55,035
And, you know, and then there's
my day to day, which is an open

1066
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,745
source, uh, the form code base.

1067
00:48:56,745 --> 00:48:59,265
So, so lots of fun stuff going
on in there.

1068
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:00,225
That is awesome.

1069
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:03,585
Bekah: And we will link all of
those things in the show notes.

1070
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:07,725
Um, is there any last advice you
have for our listeners?

1071
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:11,415
Nick: Uh, spiders aren't bad.

1072
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,875
It's just, I, I have.

1073
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,805
Unnatural fear of them.

1074
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:15,525
I don't know why.

1075
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:17,535
Um, but they eat bugs.

1076
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:20,565
So I, I have some in the corners
of my office and

1077
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:22,455
I know they're there and they're
doing good work.

1078
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:23,685
So thanks buddy.

1079
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:25,694
Bekah: That is excellent.

1080
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:28,035

being here with us.

1081
