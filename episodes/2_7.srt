1
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,431
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season two, episode seven of

2
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:30,100
the Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

3
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,480
that features members of the
Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,140
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,340
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this

6
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,149
podcast, sharing their stories
and what they've learned.

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,100
And we're here to share it with
you.

8
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,920
Here with me today is my cohost,
Dan.

9
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,436
Dan: And this episode, we talk
with Nerando Johnson,

10
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,347
a full-stack developer, and in
my mind, a living,

11
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:57,487
breathing ray of sunshine.
Nerando shared some of his

12
00:00:54,176 --> 00:01:00,837
experiences running freeCodeCamp
meetups in Atlanta, learning

13
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:03,046
through hackathons, and his
approach to learning

14
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:05,605
in general, as a developer.
Bekah and I also decided

15
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:09,085
on his next endeavor:
Socialization as a Service

16
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:12,426
for introverts at tech events.
It was a true delight as always

17
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:14,275
to spend some time with Nerando.
And I know you're

18
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,275
going to enjoy it.

19
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:16,956
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

20
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,516
Like we start every Virtual
Coffee.

21
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,825
We introduce ourselves with our
name, where we're

22
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:24,036
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

23
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:27,756
Today's question is- you're
going to sail around the world.

24
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:31,445
What's the name of your boat? We
hope you enjoy this episode.

25
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,411
Hey, I'm Bekah. I'm a front end
developer

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,090
from a small town in Ohio. And
if I was going to sell

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,870
around the world, my boat's name
would be, I think I would

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,990
probably go with the name of my
first pet, which was

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,031
a hamster named Starscraper to
the Highest Moon.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,730
And, um, that would be my boat's
name too.

31
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,021
Dan: Second appearance of
Starscraper, I feel like

32
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,980
on the podcast, do we have any
pictures of Starscraper

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,740
to the Highest Moon?

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,221
Bekah: No I don't think I have
any Starscraper.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,001
Dan: all right, well, we'll have
to dig it up in my head

36
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,080
Nerando: I was, I was saying,
okay, go for it.

37
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,420
Dan: Um, hi, my name is Dan I'm
a front end developer

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,496
from , Lakewood, Ohio. And, um,
if I'm going to sail

39
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:27,466
around the world in a boat. I,
somebody asked a boat

40
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:30,195
related name, you know, boat
naming thing on slack,

41
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:34,156
I think a while back. And I came
up with float none,

42
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:36,406
which was a CSS joke that I was
just giggling to myself

43
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:38,806
about for the rest of the day.
And so I'm sticking with

44
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,945
that float float colon none is
my boat name.

45
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:43,001
Bekah: Right.

46
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,135
Nerando: Um, hi, my name is
Nerando.

47
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:49,756
I am a, uh, call myself a level
1.5 full stack

48
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:55,665
developer out of Atlanta. If I
was going to sail around

49
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:56,806
the world with that boat, what
would the name be?

50
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,931
Yeah, I'd call it Almost There.
So every time, every

51
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,281
time you asked me, where am I
Almost There?

52
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:06,686
Dan: That sounds familiar. I
like that.

53
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,760
Bekah: That is awesome. Well,
thank you so much for

54
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:13,890
being here with us today. We're
really excited

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,251
to talk to you. And we always
like to start

56
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:20,580
with the origin story. So how
did you get to this point?

57
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,200
Um, what is the backstory of
Nerando

58
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,441
Nerando: so there is a 15 minute
version and the five

59
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:27,751
minute version on a three, I'm
going to give it a three.

60
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:34,080
Um, because I talk so much in my
early teens, my mom

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,091
sent me off to teacher's college
in the Caribbean.

62
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:42,491
So I started teaching when I
was. 19 cause I'm one of

63
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,600
those kids who are way too smart
for anything.

64
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,010
So I became a professional
teacher at 19, along the way.

65
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,730
I discovered that my students
learn to way more when I put

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,040
them in front of a computer than
I actually stand in

67
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,721
front of a classroom teacher. So
I'm like, all right, cool.

68
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:59,591
I started making like drag and
drop games for them.

69
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,290
And I hit like 28. I was like,
yeah, I

70
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:11,411
can't do this anymore. Um, so I.
A couple of other stuff happened

71
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:14,561
and I'm like, you know what?
Let's make a shift because

72
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,491
I lived in Jamaica, but my
family lived here.

73
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,821
And my mom says if you want  to
make a move, like,

74
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,740
all right, cool, give away
everything and sell everything.

75
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:28,571
Move. Being here, the book
world. Was a big thing.

76
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,740
CS 50 was a thing. And I am
like, I was

77
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:35,110
always a techie guy. I also have
a background

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
as a computer. I'm a trained
computer

79
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,711
repair technician. So I've
always liked.

80
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,266
Had like small programs to like
fix and build stuff.

81
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:47,365
But the code was always like,
there I up, like I've been

82
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:52,105
running Linux since like 2010,
like Ubuntu was my

83
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,625
thing and I've made stuff. I
fixed stuff.

84
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:58,136
I'm like, it was always cool,
but the code was always there

85
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:02,036
and I'm like, you know what?
Let's go learn this.

86
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:08,005
HTML and CSS was fun. And then
JavaScript promptly

87
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:11,696
decided to drop me on my face
and reminded me that I

88
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:11,696
have no idea what now my dog,

89
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:12,906
Bekah: Sounds familiar.

90
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:18,415
Nerando: um, while doing all of
this, I mean,

91
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:22,675
freeCodeCamp came out. Like the
first version came out

92
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:25,826
and I'm like, Ooh, this is cool.
I went through my first

93
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:31,286
meetup, fell in love with it.
Um, that group canceled most

94
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:35,665
of my second meetup group, which
was in, um, the Sandy

95
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:37,165
Springs area of Atlanta. This is
like 2017.

96
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,771
I met some cool people and I
never dropped a habit.

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,110
I'd always wanted to drop it
because it's frustrating,

98
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,721
but I've never dropped the habit
after that.

99
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,771
Um, did some community work with
one of our other men became good

100
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,860
friends with a lot of people.
Did some community work

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,891
with like one of my friends
called Mark Noonan.

102
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,021
I don't know if he's a guy who
should be on this next.

103
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,360
He can tell the other, usually
he can tell the

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,821
other side of the story. Um,
we've done.

105
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,675
I've done a hackathon. I got a
scholarship

106
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:10,605
to go to Flat Iron. That was
interesting,

107
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:13,216
like the whole nine yards. And I
eventually got to the

108
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:15,826
place of like, did the bootcamp
experience failed along the way?

109
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:19,065
Got back at it, finished the
boot camp went

110
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:23,596
through the job search. My last
place was Warner, but

111
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:24,735
COVID decided to borrow back,
take back my job from me.

112
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:31,235
So I'm currently on there. So
yeah, bear bearing

113
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:35,680
in mind along the way. I almost
learned to code in

114
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:37,360
high school, college ones. Cause
all my friends

115
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,591
learned to code. I didn't um,
when I was

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,341
teaching, there was a program
that came up.

117
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,610
I never took it, but every time
coding came up, I stepped

118
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,411
away because I was more
interested in other things.

119
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,240
So the last time it came up, I'm
like, yeah,

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,060
we're going to take this

121
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:56,055
Bekah: nice. Were you online for
Flat

122
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,055
Iron or did you go to campus?

123
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,310
Nerando: In person. Dear God, in
person, it was good.

124
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:03,341
Bekah: Yeah. I always was
curious about

125
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:06,880
that because I did their online
self-paced program and it

126
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:09,461
always seemed interesting to be
able to like go on campus

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,750
and see other people and to have
those conversations.

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,930
But I mean, it wasn't available
around me and also I didn't

129
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,810
have that availability either.

130
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:20,240
Nerando: Mhm, in person is a
whole different experience

131
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,971
because it tends to be at any
one time you have two

132
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,271
cohorts on campus back then when
you were doing the

133
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:32,326
first module, you had three. But
it was always, I,

134
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:34,276
it was collaborative. It was a
lot of

135
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,555
people going crazy. You saw that
you are the

136
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:38,565
only person losing your mind,
trying to learn so

137
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,625
much stuff at one time. Yeah.
Stuff like that, but it was

138
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,695
good.

139
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,235
Bekah: I feel like that's a
really important part of

140
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,755
the process because when you're
isolated in learning,

141
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,576
there's nobody else to kind of
compare that to.

142
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:52,680
And so having that. I don't know
if it's community

143
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,471
support or at least that
recognition that like, oh,

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,610
other people are, are really
struggling right now, too.

145
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,461
There's this weird feeling of,
okay.

146
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,730
I feel, I feel good that
everybody's struggling, right?

147
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,100
Like,

148
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,946
Nerando: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, learning collaboratively

149
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:12,125
while learning for yourself is
helpful because the

150
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:14,346
emotional support is there. And
you get to ask questions

151
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:17,165
because some parts of it you
get, but some parts

152
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:20,105
you don't get and you get to ask
like instructors

153
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,826
or TAs or your classmates. So
yeah.

154
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,913
Bekah: so you mentioned Mark
Noonan and we were in

155
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:25,774
a Virtual Coffee one day and we
were talking about

156
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:32,943
like how to stay motivated. And
he said, you need a Nerando

157
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:34,624
because he makes sure that I
stay on top of these things.

158
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,254
And I thought.

159
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:43,823
Nerando: okay. All right. So the
joke around that

160
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:45,953
is that, um, Mark's been my
friend since God.

161
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:51,624
It's 2021 now. So I think 2017,
2018, we

162
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,344
got to be really good friends
through our hackathon.

163
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,333
And because I have a teacher's
grown, it kind of

164
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,413
helps me literally go stay on
task and get it done.

165
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,494
So Mark's like, oh, pretty
butterfly.

166
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:07,288
I'm like, you are not. The dog
from Up, you do

167
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:08,759
not have a squirrel moment.
Focus. He's like, "what?

168
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,068
No, I want to!" I don't care.
And he's like, "but you don't

169
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:16,198
know how to write a code". I'm
like, no, but if I

170
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:16,908
put you here long enough, we'll
get it done.

171
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:25,948
He goes, "I hate you". But yeah,
it's it's to this

172
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:29,698
day, I'm still learning how to
be better focused at

173
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:33,058
stuff, but it's a continuous
progress and project for me.

174
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:37,724
Because it's like the one thing
that nobody really tells us as

175
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:43,244
human beings is that you have
finite time to do anything you

176
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:46,693
want, not infinite, finite, like
you have this amount of

177
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:49,634
years before your body stops
working or your mind goes,

178
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:53,114
and you've got to get all this
done before that, but we keep

179
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:55,923
thinking we have all the time.
No you don't. So yeah.

180
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,519
Bekah: Okay. So you've been
involved in a

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,820
lot of different things and you
talked about being involved

182
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,220
in freeCodeCamp already,
hackathons, and in boot camps.

183
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,090
And so I'm curious, like what
were some of the lessons that

184
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,990
you learned there, but also what
were your favorite experiences?

185
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:15,959
Nerando: um, so you say
hackathon, bootcamp. Um,

186
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,894
alright.

187
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:19,174
Bekah: freeCodeCamp.

188
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:21,095
Nerando: freeCodeCamp. So let's 
start

189
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,524
with freeCodeCamp. Cause that's
where

190
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:26,424
it all began for me.
freeCodeCamp taught me that

191
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:27,715
A: learning in a community is
really good for you.

192
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,764
The operation sides of running a
meetup is way different from

193
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,825
just talking, because like I
learned and I'd be there.

194
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,534
And I learned stuff when I
started running it, I

195
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,544
learned from like 15 minutes,
cause I'm walking around

196
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:41,475
and talking to them, people
breaking the ice so-and-so

197
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:47,534
stuff, so and so forth. And at
the same time, I'm really

198
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:51,715
good at making connections.
Cause then I like I've learned

199
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:54,865
over the years that frequently
we have a lot of teachers,

200
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:58,884
former teachers, we have a lot
of former musicians, which

201
00:10:54,865 --> 00:11:03,355
is weird to me and we tend to
have like 40% left-handed

202
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:03,355
people as developers, which

203
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,580
Bekah: I always wanted to be
left-handed.

204
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:08,754
Nerando: The trick is that I'm
left-handed so I notice it.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,470
Like we have a lot of
left-handed people.

206
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,250
So those aren't experienced. I
learned in there, like

207
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,259
some people will come learn. The
code would be wanting

208
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,850
to be a developer. Others will
learn it.

209
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,210
Want to be a developer and then
go hey, not for me.

210
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,330
And you should be that's okay.
You will have hobbies.

211
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,169
Like I learned how to deal with
moms with children.

212
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,514
Like that's a whole nother
thing. I've never had to think

213
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,649
of.

214
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,455
Um, I learned how to deal with
people who can come for an hour

215
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,884
cause they are running Lyft or
they're working on a Sunday

216
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,715
and that's all they can do. I
learned how to

217
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,455
support peopleonline, like stuff
like that.

218
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:45,264
I learned how to do, I'm still
learning, but those

219
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,424
are the things that I learned,
uh, hackathons,

220
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:51,414
the myths of thinking you can't
create something

221
00:11:51,414 --> 00:12:00,549
from an idea over 24 hours. Is
not true how good it is

222
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:04,720
is that total different ball
game, but you can do it in 24

223
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:08,590
hours filled with the right set
of people and coffee

224
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:14,875
and no sleep and red bull. Um,
MARTA's hackathon

225
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:16,044
was one of the best experience
I've ever had.

226
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,534
I still have pictures of all the
food they put on the table.

227
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:23,065
And one of the chairman or one
of the senior guys singing

228
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,315
and singing karaoke at one
o'clock in the morning.

229
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:34,195
Cause we were all up. Um, but
like hackathons tend

230
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:36,955
to, I encourage everybody, even
if you you're not confident,

231
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:38,065
Hey, I don't know anything.
Nobody cares.

232
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:42,205
Like honestly, nobody in the
room will care because you will

233
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,375
have something to contribute.

234
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,783
Bekah: Let's jump back to
freeCodeCamp for a minute.

235
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,613
Cause I think that's really
interesting.

236
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:52,283
So you attended two different
freeCodeCamp

237
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:56,743
meetups, but you also ran
freeCodeCamp meetups, right?

238
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,452
Nerando: I'm still running it.
We're more we're slowed down

239
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,452
because of COVID, but yeah.

240
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,133
Bekah: Right. that freeCodeCamp
Atlanta?

241
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:04,682
Nerando: Yes, it's freeCodeCamp
Atlanta.

242
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:07,802
We have like a Facebook group
that we use that we do, like

243
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,982
once, like once a month we have
like a check-in I'm

244
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:14,462
trying to go a little bit
bigger, but I kind of have a

245
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,773
lot of other things going on. So
I'm trying to just

246
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:20,533
slow down for a minute.
Hopefully by the end of this

247
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:23,082
year, next year we can start
doing in-person meetups

248
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:27,452
again, that would be awesome.
Bekah you should submit for

249
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,452
our in-person conferences.

250
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:32,028
Bekah: That's referring to a
tweet yesterday that I sent

251
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,898
saying I'm very tempted to start
submitting for in-person

252
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:41,778
conferences, again, I miss it.
Not even speaking, just being

253
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:41,778
there and having the experience.

254
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,089
Dan: Can you tell me a little
more about what you do at the

255
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,469
freeCodeCamp, Atlanta meetups.

256
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,623
Nerando: all right. So our
freeCodeCamp Atlanta

257
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:55,312
meetups are generally structured
as in we find a comfortable

258
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,783
place that we can all sit and
have food and all of that stuff.

259
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:02,273
And we just for, our use-case we
sit and whatever project you're

260
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,883
working on, you can come and ask
questions and discuss it.

261
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:09,832
We tend not to be structured.
We've always tried going

262
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:10,873
structured, but it never works
out so it's...

263
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,758
more like a group of chill,
people just sitting

264
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:17,038
and working and stuff. But what
happens

265
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,707
from this though? Because we
have no structure.

266
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,528
We tend to refer people to like
other meetups.

267
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:26,687
We tend to have people who are
further ahead in their career.

268
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:31,398
So you have mentorship going on.
You tend to have networking

269
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:32,868
opportunities where somebody
could say, Hey, can you

270
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:35,567
apply it to this job? Because
mine has an opening,

271
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:37,307
bearing in mind that the opening
has not been made public, but.

272
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,528
You see somebody who has a
potential to go.

273
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,538
And even if you don't pass the
interview,

274
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:42,618
you have the experience

275
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,239
Dan: great. Yeah. So cause,
cause freeCodeCamp,

276
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:50,099
like, so everybody's maybe a
different, you know,

277
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:52,438
different levels of whatever.
And so your meetup is more

278
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:53,068
of just like a, almost like a
support group,

279
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,028
Nerando: well, yeah, that's,
that's

280
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,149
Dan: Yeah. That's awesome.
That's really cool.

281
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:01,403
I am also looking forward to in
person meet ups, uh,

282
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,614
becoming a thing again, you
know, we had the Cleveland

283
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:06,293
React meet up and it was, it was
a lot of fun and we had,

284
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,453
you know, it was just pizza and
that same kind of thing,

285
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:11,604
and went online and, you know,
we were still doing meetups,

286
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:15,953
but they're, I don't know. It's
just, it's so

287
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,953
much more nice to

288
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:16,927
Nerando: I

289
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,504
Dan: be in the same room with
people. Huh?

290
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,677
Nerando: I think we all took
pizza for granted.

291
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,048
Dan: I still have in my notes,
my like, you know, script for

292
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,958
running the meetup about, you
know, directions and pizza,

293
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,908
you know, where the, where the
pizza is and stuff like that.

294
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:33,729
Oh, man.

295
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:37,013
Bekah: I think one of the nice
things though, that's

296
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,232
come from all this, like I could
never attend a meet up

297
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,982
because I've got four kids and I
live in a small town.

298
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,173
Um, But in the post COVID world,
I imagine there's going

299
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:52,393
to be a really nice balance of
those things and maybe

300
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,913
even some hybrid events that are
going to be happening.

301
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:57,552
And I think that'll be nice to
provide community for

302
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:01,513
so many more people than then
would have had it. Otherwise

303
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:05,388
Nerando: I have been thinking
about that too,

304
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:09,707
even as a organizer, because
then you see like, it.

305
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:14,253
It like, it helps way more. Like
I've had friends who

306
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:16,633
say, Hey, I can't meet in the
meet up, but if you can grab

307
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:19,302
your laptop, turn on your
hotspot go in your car and

308
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,373
set what else for an hour. I
probably could walk you

309
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:24,043
through an issue you're having.
And like you're at

310
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:28,423
home, you could make it. But
instead of driving 30

311
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:30,582
minutes to us bearing in mind,
we've had members who

312
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:33,222
used to drive an hour just to
get to us just because

313
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:38,023
they liked the environment. But
if you can just spend

314
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:40,212
the time and come. I mean, it
helps.

315
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:44,073
Dan: Yeah. I, um, I'm very, I'm
very

316
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:45,474
interested to see what happens
to w all this.

317
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,903
There was definitely some, um,
some groups experimenting with

318
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:51,543
like, sort of hybrid designs,
stuff like that before you COVID

319
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,706
I, um, I cannot remember what.
ReactaDelphia. That's what it

320
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,479
is.

321
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,269
The Philly, the Philly React
group was doing a lot of work

322
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,759
with this, um, before COVID, you
know, uh, where, where

323
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,558
they were streaming, they were
having in-person meetups,

324
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,179
but they were also streaming.
And I think projecting, I'm

325
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:12,028
not sure if they were doing this
too, but, um, like

326
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:15,659
having maybe zoom or something
like that, where, uh, people

327
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:17,068
could sort of be sort of there
virtually, you know?

328
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,338
Um, and there's a lot of, you
know, there's a lot of

329
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:23,469
Opportunity for cool stuff
coming up, but it really is.

330
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:25,828
I mean, like the same with
Virtual Coffee, right?

331
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,189
I mean, Virtual Coffee is, you
know, I don't know if

332
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:32,368
this was some other thing where
it wasn't a pandemic,

333
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,939
you know, but same situation. It
might've ended up being

334
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:41,249
a local thing, you know? Um, the
Steubenville, you know,

335
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:46,348
I don't know, developers meet up
or something and, uh, you know,

336
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:50,263
the, the exposure and the, the.
The flexibility of the

337
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:53,864
virtual meetups is huge. Right.
But, well, I think we're lot

338
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:55,693
of people are missing actual
in-person feel of some things.

339
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,443
Um, um, um, I'm looking forward
to the future.

340
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,084
You know, I feel like there's a
spot for all, all

341
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,243
of this, all this kind of mixed
together, you know?

342
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:06,732
Nerando: Bekah, you had a point.

343
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:12,998
Bekah: You read my face. Our
initial tagline for

344
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:14,678
Virtual Coffee was "The
Always-Remote Hallway Track".

345
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:15,863
Right. Cause there's that
hallway track at conferences

346
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:16,988
that

347
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:20,048
is just really nice because you
get to meet people and

348
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,278
have that support and talk to
people, get that interaction.

349
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,188
And then at some point, I mean,
we are Virtual

350
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:31,343
Coffee, but I think I. I mean, I
hear it over and over.

351
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,472
Like when are we all going to
meet? Right.

352
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:36,292
And there is something very
special about these

353
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,553
friendships and the community
that's been formed.

354
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:42,573
And that's why I like really
like this idea of a hybrid model

355
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:46,833
because also in-person, I don't
get to meet people that are on

356
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:51,798
the other side of the world or.
In Canada, even, you know?

357
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:55,097
Um, so it's nice to be able to
meet those people and then like

358
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:59,478
finding that space where you can
have a physical presence,

359
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,718
I think would, is going to be a
really amazing thing

360
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:03,617
when we get to that point.

361
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,532
Nerando: I think like one of the
things I learned like

362
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,413
over the years, so here's a
cheat code to anybody who is

363
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:12,772
going to think about this. When
conferences come back

364
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:16,343
in one of the easiest way for
like junior devs or level one

365
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:18,563
developers to get into big
conferences is to volunteer.

366
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,682
I've done that at Connect.Tech
when it was that thing.

367
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:26,123
And I don't mind the physical
work cause sometimes that

368
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,292
literally like physical work and
cooking literally

369
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:34,682
is like therapy for me. So when
I got my ticket,

370
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:35,913
I'd get the ticket to go to the
all-day conference.

371
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:41,252
I've met so much people over
two, three years

372
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:47,853
just by doing that. Um, another
thing is

373
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:49,563
like when they have the
after-parties for conferences.

374
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:56,252
Those one thirty conversations.
They are like, it tends

375
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:57,843
to be the persons who present,
who socialize.

376
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,633
So you are in a newbie learning
from somebody who's been

377
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,823
doing this for like 10 years.
Like I met  Chris DeMars.

378
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:06,292
He, I think he's been here
before.

379
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,692
I don't know if he's ever been
on Virtual Coffee, but Chris

380
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,752
DeMars is we, he presented, I
went to his talk while at

381
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:15,827
Connect.Tech and then, when they
had the after party,

382
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,798
me, I'm one of my batch mates,
um, to any kind he

383
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,577
works for, I think FullStory
now, but we were there late.

384
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:25,968
And then I met somebody like
along the way I met,

385
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,817
I got to develop a better
relationship with this

386
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,008
guy called Homer Gaines. Homer
does accessibility.

387
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:35,087
He is crazy. He also makes
music. So. I didn't meet.

388
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,708
I didn't know these people until
then.

389
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:38,917
And then I thought another
connection to go to another

390
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:42,097
conference by meeting somebody
else just they're like,

391
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,738
Hey, would you like to come? And
I'm like, no ticket, no time.

392
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,807
They're like, okay, we'll get
your ticket.

393
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:50,708
You got to find your way there.
A friend of mine and a

394
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:52,087
friend of mine connected me to
go to the conference.

395
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,698
I'm like, my car won't make it.
They're like, okay.

396
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,228
Uh, how much do you need to rent
a car?

397
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,597
I'm like, oh, and what you're
like, you need to exposure.

398
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:03,917
So it's like conferences that
helps that's a

399
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,567
cheat sheet right there. I'm
giving away that one.

400
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,824
Dan: I think that's right. I
mean, volunteering is great.

401
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:11,413
I mean, like that's great
advice, I think in

402
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:16,394
general, and it's the same. If
you're helping out, you

403
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:19,003
know, it, people are always
gonna appreciate it and you

404
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:22,163
know, they'll go a long way, but
I actually was actually had,

405
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:24,673
thinking about what you said
about like after parties and

406
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:27,284
the late night, you know, or
like the diff the conversations

407
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:29,894
outside of the events, you know,
and, you know, honestly

408
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:32,233
for me, that's the, those are
the things that, um, at

409
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:34,364
conferences that stick in my
brain the best, I was just

410
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:37,903
thinking back, you know, and,
and just sitting on like a patio

411
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:41,413
of a restaurant with, with like
Dan Cederholm and Andy Clarke

412
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:44,773
like having conversations with
these people that I like look

413
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:47,398
up to, you know, and I don't.
I'm sorry. I don't remember what

414
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,108
their talks were about. You know
what I mean?

415
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,048
But like, I very much remember
like sitting there and just

416
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:54,749
soaking it up and you know, like
talking on, I don't know.

417
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,469
It's cool. I don't really have a
point

418
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,867
other than like, I was just, it
made me nostalgic, um, for

419
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:05,722
Bekah: I think I have lots of
thoughts now, but I

420
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,923
will say too, there's also
diversity scholarships.

421
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,913
So if you're from an
underrepresented group in

422
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:13,512
tech, that's a way to get into
some conferences.

423
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,432
Some of them even pay for your
travel.

424
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:18,432
Um, sometimes they'll offer
discounted tickets too.

425
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:21,613
So I think that number one,
recognizing if it's not

426
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:24,863
doable, For you reach out to the
conference organizers

427
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:27,173
because there might be some way
to get you there.

428
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,212
And I think Dan, like what
you're talking about, and

429
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:32,752
Nerando what you're talking
about, it's the idea of

430
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,942
these personal connections that
are being made there.

431
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:38,603
And I love that aspect of the
conference and that's one

432
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:42,413
of the things that I think I
wish would go on beyond that.

433
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:44,722
Right? Because you have this
conference, you make these

434
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:49,792
connections and then there's. At
least most of them that

435
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:52,613
I've been to, there's not been
that like, Hey, let's

436
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:59,663
continue to keep up in some way.
And I think that that would be

437
00:22:53,032 --> 00:23:02,962
a really fun thing to continue
to do all throughout the year,

438
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:02,962
because then you grow together.

439
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:10,617
Nerando: All right. There is
some, like, what

440
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:12,988
I've learned with for myself is
how to keep up

441
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:17,397
that con conversation. So I have
been known to not

442
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:19,347
be afraid to stop be like, one
of my friends says, do you

443
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:22,107
want, if your greatest skill is
that you're never afraid to

444
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:23,157
walk into a room where nobody
knows you and talk to people.

445
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:26,728
I'm like, I know what I need
from the room.

446
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:33,863
So like Virtual Coffee came to
me by means offs like posts.

447
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:38,182
How should I say it posts COVID
Warner.

448
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:40,853
Like when I was at Warner,
because I've worked, I'd

449
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,863
like I needed a group. I
couldn't find anywhere.

450
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:44,182
I'm not like somebody like a
Virtual Coffee.

451
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:46,958
I'm like Virtual Coffee? Like
okay.

452
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,948
Hopped in first meetup. I'm
like, Ooh, like this room.

453
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,438
And then we had Mike Rogers walk
into room

454
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,567
and hype in the room up. I'm
like, who is this dude?

455
00:23:55,567 --> 00:24:04,788
And how shall I be his friend?
And then Meg, like for me, Mike

456
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:08,438
Rogers, Meg, um, Debra-Kaye is
like, I, the energy that

457
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:10,137
comes to the room and then
Bekah's kids were running

458
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:12,577
through the background? And I'm
like, mom, I'm home.

459
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:18,577
Like, that was awesome for me.
But to further on the

460
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:21,667
conversation is like we don't
tech is on Twitter and

461
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:23,258
a lot of us are afraid of using
Twitter for what it is.

462
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:29,137
Talk to people, engage. I am a
fan of Gary V and

463
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:31,807
the whole conversation of like,
understanding who

464
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:32,827
you are, what you're about.
Yeah. Do that.

465
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:38,198
Some conferences will have like
swag, like Bekah, I'm

466
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:40,238
throwing this out there. We need
stickers.

467
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:45,188
And also we need to get, we need
to get Mike.

468
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:50,347
I want one and we also need to
get Mike his official

469
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:56,317
Hype-Man t-shirt I'm just
saying, but we con like,

470
00:24:56,688 --> 00:25:01,567
like for us as developers,
engage, talk to each other.

471
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,192
Like some people will be the
best thing that

472
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:07,163
ever happened to you. And some
people suck

473
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:09,593
and that's okay. Filter, keep it
going.

474
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:13,403
Because at the end of the day,
developers are highly

475
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:17,813
in demand and the better off we
are like a developer

476
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:21,173
can make quarter-million
dollars, easy trick is that

477
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:26,182
you can only do one job.
There'll be 50 more that you

478
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:28,702
know of that needs to be filled.
And you have, if you make

479
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:29,512
better associates, it's better
for you in the longterm.

480
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:35,107
So I'm just saying. Yeah. I
learned about an AWS

481
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:36,728
developer that makes quarter
million dollars and my

482
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,728
head is still hurting.

483
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:44,182
Bekah: I love, I think, well,
for me to, uh, conferences, I

484
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:48,383
am super shy and an introvert.
And so I get really

485
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:53,002
nervous going into there. But I
think if you know, someone

486
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:57,022
ahead of time, um, making sure
that you meet up or have

487
00:25:53,002 --> 00:26:00,083
that friend person, um, there.
So Nerando, you'll be my

488
00:25:57,292 --> 00:26:01,343
friend person because I'll just
follow you around.

489
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,958
Nerando: I have no problem. I
got no problem with that.

490
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,718
Believe me. I will, I will take
you on as my wing man.

491
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,938
And literally goes, oh yeah,
this is Bekah.

492
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:11,607
You should talk there. I
literally have done

493
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:13,008
this to somebody before. I'm
like, this is Bekah.

494
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,518
You should talk to her. She's
awesome.

495
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,738
She runs Virtual Coffee. Here's
a website. Goodbye.

496
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:20,278
It was like, why are you leaving
me here? Talk mingle.

497
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:20,938
You'll be fine.

498
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:27,936
Dan: Yeah, I have that too. That
that's probably really

499
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:28,926
why I have more fond memories of
sitting like at the table.

500
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:31,777
You know, it's like a little
easier to kind

501
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:37,896
of know what to do. I don't
know. Then when you're in a

502
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:40,446
large group of people, but I'll
follow, I'll follow

503
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:40,446
you guys around too.

504
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,425
Bekah: just having your little
line of Virtual Coffee people.

505
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,436
Dan: Right. It's just gonna be
dropping us off.

506
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,840
Nerando: Stay right here. Talk
to all these wonder

507
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:56,730
people I'll be back. I was like,
why

508
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:59,191
are you doing this? Because I
can stress you

509
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:04,171
out for the fun of it. The
people that know me on

510
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,161
Twitter, if they ever hear this
podcast are going to

511
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:08,161
start crying, especially Homer
is going to start laughing.

512
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,121
I know this already.

513
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,916
Dan: I have it. This is 
socialization

514
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:14,076
as a service. This is, it
started charging.

515
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:16,926
So you just like, you know,
somebody, somebody pays a fee

516
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,787
and then you you'd be walking
around in the conference.

517
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:24,356
I love it. All right.

518
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,790
Nerando: Socialization as a
service. I like that one.

519
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,965
All right. We missed, we missed
one topic.

520
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:52,106
I think hackathons. I think the
thing that stops

521
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:54,777
a lot of, I'll never say junior
developers because

522
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:58,886
it doesn't really feel good.
Level one developers from,

523
00:27:55,136 --> 00:28:02,696
and people who have no code
experience from even trying is

524
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:08,356
because they think that there's
this bar there and you have to

525
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:11,932
be as good enough as this to do.
As I have previously

526
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:16,251
stated I don't care. So I'll
just go, okay, this is

527
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:18,942
something I need to learn, or
this is something I need to have

528
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:25,071
an introduction to and I'll go.
They, again, this is an

529
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:28,827
industry where you knowing
somebody is way more important

530
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:30,688
than actually knowing what
you're doing, because along

531
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:36,147
the way, people can help you. So
it's one of them things

532
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:39,117
where it's like, just go, like,
nobody cares. Just go.

533
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:44,188
And you learn. Like I learned
way more

534
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:45,837
than I've ever learned. Like, I
made better friends.

535
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,028
I've made better connections. I
learned a lot.

536
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:53,952
I learned how to speak on stuff.
I stood in front of a crowd of

537
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:55,123
like a hundred people and spoke
about what we were working on.

538
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:58,663
My knees didn't work properly,
but I did it anyway because

539
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:02,772
I don't like public speaking.
Don't laugh that the

540
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:02,772
irony is not lost on me

541
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:11,134
Dan: That's so, yeah. Yeah. So
how many hackathons have

542
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,134
you have you like done?

543
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:17,682
Nerando: far. As a long process,
three

544
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:19,002
MARTA, however, broke theirs up
into four.

545
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:23,942
So technically it would count as
five. Yeah.

546
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:26,125
Dan: that's awesome. I've never
done one.

547
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:29,694
I, by the time I was sort of
interested in them I

548
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,515
had kids and it was just, I
don't know, it's much harder

549
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:36,355
to spend 24 hours away. And, um,
also I'm old.

550
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,575
And so being losing sleep really

551
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:39,722
Nerando: did you

552
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,035
Dan: for longer than it used to.

553
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,663
Nerando: Did he just drop in?
I'm older really quickly.

554
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:47,119
Dan: I was just going to move on
from that, but the recovery

555
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,900
time from a, from a all-nighter
is much worse now than it was.

556
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,809
Um, I had an accidental all
night or, um, the other day

557
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,480
and was just, uh, just a
horrible wreck the whole,

558
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:00,349
the whole rest of the day. So
it's like another

559
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,730
hackathon related, like as like,
ah, that sounds cool.

560
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,779
But now I'm just like, I don't
know.

561
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:09,500
I gotta think about losing all
that sleep, which then I'm

562
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,880
like, oh yeah, cause I'm old. I
don't know.

563
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:14,758
Nerando: I think for me with
hackathons, I'm more

564
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:17,637
energized with what we learn and
where what's

565
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:23,307
going on than anything else. So
I will, I mean, I'm the

566
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:25,228
guy I need five and a half hours
asleep to be okay.

567
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:31,948
I can survive on four and I I've
done college in Jamaica,

568
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:37,048
which is no fun some days. So I
learned how to

569
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:38,188
survive on no sleep, but
hackathons really like.

570
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:43,528
The pro you learn so much, like
so much so quickly, you

571
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:44,877
meet so much different people.

572
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,940
Dan: Okay. I think that's cool.
I've never really thought

573
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,609
about hackathons as, as like a
tool for career devs.

574
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,799
But now that you mentioned it, I
think that's a great

575
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,869
idea because, uh, like you're
saying, you just,

576
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,519
you're just stuck there. So you
have to learn.

577
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,829
I'm one of, you know, one of the
problems that I've heard

578
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,680
a lot from people learning is
like, I don't want choosing

579
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,660
what to learn or how to learn or
all that stuff.

580
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,210
And when you are stuck in a room
and, you know,

581
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,325
working with other people. Yeah.
I mean, you, you soak up the

582
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:12,214
knowledge from other people, but
also you're just like

583
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:15,724
pointed in one direction. You
don't really have, you know,

584
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:18,664
you know, have choice, I assume
not having done it, but I would

585
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:21,934
assume that if you are a less
experienced dev sitting there,

586
00:31:18,664 --> 00:31:24,664
then the people will help with
like choosing what, to, you

587
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:27,154
know, what you should do, right.
Or whatever, and, um,

588
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:28,055
and kind of just have one target
and move forward.

589
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,384
Um, that seems like a great,
great opportunity for,

590
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,305
you know, people learning.

591
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:37,413
Nerando: So from that, you'll
also learn like the other side

592
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:40,472
of dev work, which is like
figuring out how to build what

593
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:42,992
to build quickly, figuring out
what we need really quickly,

594
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:46,323
um, figuring out like what
storage that I learned, how to

595
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:49,883
write stories in a hackathon. I
never knew about

596
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:55,843
user stories before. So from. So
from hackathon, like

597
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:59,833
with MARTA in Atlanta Mark is
technically the leader

598
00:31:55,873 --> 00:32:01,303
in this thing and I'm his right
hand, Mark Noonan.

599
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:04,722
And from that they changed
policy like the city change

600
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:07,752
policy and I'm like, oh my God,
they listened to us.

601
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:11,272
We worked on paratransit and how
to make that better.

602
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:15,383
And that got better. And then we
took that and

603
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:18,472
when somewhere else and enter
just for the fun of it, same

604
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:22,522
concept, because we wanted more
awareness to the problem

605
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:26,032
we're having that, that, that
process of like six or seven

606
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:28,553
months are a bit longer. We
ended up winning

607
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:31,163
that hackathon. And because we
never, because

608
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:32,542
MARTA literally made us never
winning anything.

609
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:37,282
We signed the agreement between
all of us to give away the

610
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:40,012
money in case we won anything.
The trick is that we won.

611
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:43,372
We won 40 grand and gave it
away. To this day, I'm still

612
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:45,681
beating

613
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:48,472
myself because we could have all
put it in Bitcoins,

614
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:49,942
walk away with Mac books and
still give away 40 grand.

615
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:56,383
But it's a really cool
conversation to have. Okay.

616
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:02,278
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
mean, it seems like

617
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:02,278
you're no, go ahead, Dan.

618
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,269
Dan: I was just laughing. I
don't have anything to say.

619
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,682
Nerando: Go go ahead, Dan,. I'm
still, I know

620
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:09,073
you're laughing at me. It's
okay.

621
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,299
Dan: I was mostly just laughing
at you hanging your head

622
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,349
at the end of that story.

623
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,732
Nerando: I'll I'll I'll drop the
article when this is done.

624
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,653
So you can read the article
cause Mark actually

625
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:21,492
wrote an article on it.

626
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:23,458
Bekah: Yeah, we'll put that in
the show

627
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:24,289
Dan: definitely send that.

628
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,117
Bekah: Um, okay. So you've been
involved in

629
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:33,893
all of these things and. I feel
like you're constantly

630
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:36,623
moving and you never stop. And
so now you said that,

631
00:33:33,923 --> 00:33:38,752
I think you said, what are you
like a level one

632
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:42,893
and a half developer? Right?
Like, and one of the things

633
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:46,012
that I found is that there's not
that many people that

634
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:47,512
are talking about like, what
that means like that stage.

635
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,732
Cause I feel like it's kind of a
hard stage, right?

636
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:53,032
You're like you're beyond that
level one and you're trying

637
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,813
to make it to level two. And so
there's these

638
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,573
growing pains going on? But
nobody's talking

639
00:33:57,113 --> 00:34:02,633
about those growing pains. So I
don't know if you have any

640
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:05,663
thoughts on that or, you know,
like what your experience has

641
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,663
been, but I'd love to hear it.

642
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,902
Nerando: so you want like, like
mentally I've had this talking.

643
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:15,233
So now 1.5 for me means you have
to pick up a stage of mentoring

644
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:22,938
being mentored and discipline.
So. You have to write

645
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:25,237
about what you learned. This is
not the conversation

646
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:29,467
you have to teach. You have to
get better

647
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:32,768
at a core stack. So if you are a
modern

648
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:34,898
stack, I'm React/Ruby, if you
are something else,

649
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:37,628
you'll have to get better. I
will never stop

650
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:42,802
emphasizing this. JavaScript is
on an ending

651
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:45,052
like JavaScript for me is like
the 12 levels of hell.

652
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:47,003
And we keep going down into it
and you're just going

653
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,132
to have to keep going. It's
cool. It's fun.

654
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,893
It's annoying because it changes
every couple of years,

655
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,862
but you will have to get better
at your core language.

656
00:34:56,347 --> 00:35:00,788
It's building stuff. It's
walking away from tutorials.

657
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:05,288
However, pretty they look it's
asking way more questions is

658
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:09,818
volunteering for stuff that you
might not be ready for, or it's

659
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:14,648
failing horribly at something
it's asking for way more help

660
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:19,777
than you're comfortable with. I
have a toddler

661
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:23,047
in the background. I probably
should get up and go

662
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:28,222
lock the door, but I'm too lazy.
So I'm around my

663
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:30,382
nephew right now. He's here.
Yeah. his time in the morning.

664
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:38,063
Um, so it's that stage of being
aware that I'm not junior

665
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:41,273
anymore, but everybody will see
you as junior and that's fine.

666
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,443
What do you think in your head
rules? Way more.

667
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,563
And then you will have to prove
that you're there to yourself.

668
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:53,833
It's collaborative coding. It's
learning how to run our own

669
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:55,362
GitHub without losing your mind.
It's learning git like that.

670
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:57,552
It's being comfortable with the
terminal.

671
00:35:57,603 --> 00:36:04,713
It's finishing projects. It's
having conversations

672
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:06,983
about code it's like when you
reach the stage of having the

673
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:11,152
code dream you have, right. I
don't, I don't know if

674
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:11,152
I've had the code dream.

675
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:14,047
Bekah: I mean, I have nightmares
about testing all the time.

676
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:19,163
Nerando: Yeah. Oh, dream it
seeing like

677
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:20,333
basic stuff, like elevators and
literally working out.

678
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:23,092
How would this work in my
language, my coding language.

679
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:25,043
I've done it in Python and
JavaScript.

680
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:31,539
Dan: I am not sure I want to get
into a JavaScript elevator.

681
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:37,552
Nerando: Okay. Ah, come here. It
runs the internet.

682
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:39,233
It's not that bad. God.

683
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:45,106
Bekah: Okay. So, so you have
your doing all

684
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:47,266
of these things, and that was
just a ton of great advice.

685
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:50,356
I want to say, first of all. Um,
but, okay.

686
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:53,536
So how has this been looking for
new jobs?

687
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:56,056
Because you're saying like,
well, people will see you as, as

688
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:59,567
a junior, but you're like really
reaching for this next goal.

689
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,336
And I imagine that's kind of
where you're going

690
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:04,516
in your job search too. So that
been a thing.

691
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:09,282
Nerando: So the first trick I
learned from job searching

692
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,681
was by this guy called Eliot
Sanford, I think is

693
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:14,742
his last name . So I was
supposed to go to Eliot's

694
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:18,152
conference and didn't make it.
And we became friends

695
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:20,402
and he gave me advice. So he
literally goes.

696
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,777
Watch Danny Thompson's thing,
optimize your

697
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:26,777
LinkedIn, then walk away for
anybody who doesn't

698
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,677
know who Danny Thompson is. We
are in for a wild ride

699
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:30,677
because he's awesome.

700
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:32,371
Bekah: He just got a new job,
right?

701
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:39,077
Nerando: Congrats to him.
Anyway, um, that now, literally

702
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:45,777
gets you to the place of
interviewing over and over for

703
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:47,786
positions that makes you that
you think you're ready for some,

704
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:51,686
you might get some, you may not
get it's annoying because

705
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:54,686
everybody wants five years, but
nobody is junior developer

706
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:57,896
at five years experience. So
first thing I learned from

707
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:59,516
my days off Career Karma,
because that also helped me.

708
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,722
So my Career Karma, that was
really awesome.

709
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:08,711
Ruben Harris, um, for our sake,
um, Keisha Lake, who you

710
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:11,972
should talk to one of these
days, she was my batch mate.

711
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:12,581
And she's awesome.

712
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,001
Bekah: talk a little bit about
what Career Karma is?

713
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:21,731
Nerando: So Career Karma. If I'm
to distill it to

714
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:26,561
simple essence, it provides
connection to an individual,

715
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:28,902
to foreign individual to get
into tech in a variety of ways.

716
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:31,541
So if you're a developer, if
you're a software

717
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,632
engineer, if you are a data
scientist, if you want to

718
00:38:34,632 --> 00:38:37,391
get into tech sales, which I
learned was an actual thing.

719
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:40,391
A couple months ago, they
provide.

720
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:43,052
Will match you to the, probably
the right school

721
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:46,322
for you they'll even help you
find funding if needed

722
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:49,231
or find a proper agreement for
you to go to school.

723
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,132
Cause you have some schools that
do ISAs.

724
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:57,362
Some have  really good ISAs,
some suck and that's, but

725
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,851
they will help you find the
right place for you.

726
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:07,856
So that's one, that's one part.
I think I was one of the first

727
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:10,376
persons out of the group first
like good batches to actually

728
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:11,547
like really work with them and I
got the help I needed.

729
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:17,217
So yeah. And it's not lost on me
that

730
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:19,527
because of them, like I went to
Flat Iron, I had a full ride

731
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:21,536
scholarship, like all of those
coming work that I did helped.

732
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:25,556
Um, we, they also helped me find
all the funding

733
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,536
to do other stuff. I'm like,
that was cool.

734
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:32,606
So that helped. So like with all
of that,

735
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:34,211
and now it's like, you know, A
lot of things.

736
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:36,342
That's how I got to have that in
my head.

737
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,536
Bekah: no, that was really
great. And so how, how is this

738
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:44,596
kind of

739
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:46,757
pushing you into that next stage
of job that you're looking for?

740
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:50,492
Nerando: It's...I just classify
it as work.

741
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:53,461
So it's the discipline to finish
this stuff, to get

742
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:57,751
better at algorithms to own my
truth, to be able to walk

743
00:39:57,751 --> 00:40:02,126
into a room, I'm going, Hey. I
am great at this, this

744
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,257
and this, but I'm not great at
this, but I can

745
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:08,217
learn this and that's it.
That's, that's kind of

746
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:09,297
where I am when it comes to a
lot of those things.

747
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:13,887
And that's just fine, like near
my job coach on Flat

748
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,867
Iron said something that really
stuck to my head.

749
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:21,387
She says, everybody is cooking
and you are not going to be the

750
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:25,916
right ingredient for everybody.
You're going to fit one place.

751
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,286
And that one place is what
you're looking for.

752
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:33,806
So I have literally gotten nos
from one company that

753
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,817
has so many departments that
I've been refused

754
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:38,067
twice and were like, we're
throwing you in there again.

755
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:38,666
And I'm like,

756
00:40:40,014 --> 00:40:41,411
Dan: I like that. I like that
metaphor.

757
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:45,342
I'm adding it to my, my,
metaphor collection.

758
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:51,356
it a metaphor analogy? I think
It's similar. I gotta, I

759
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:51,536
gotta

760
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,735
Nerando: It's an, it's an
English saying that

761
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:56,766
means something else. We don't
care what you title it.

762
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:58,527
Dan: Fair enough.

763
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:04,271
Bekah: Okay. So along with that
job search

764
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:08,701
thing, when you, when you're
looking for jobs, do you have an

765
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:12,440
ideal job in mind or is this, I
am just looking for work because

766
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,831
I'm curious, like, what does
Nerando's ideal job look like?

767
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:18,715
Nerando: I work from Wednesdays
to Fridays two hours of day,

768
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:21,025
and you pay me half a million
dollars just to look cute.

769
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:31,690
However for code sake. Um, An
ideal job for me right

770
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:34,931
now is using my stack, which is
React and Ruby, or just

771
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,371
JavaScript and front end stuff
for while teaching.

772
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:42,791
Like it teaches me other stuff.
So it's a level, 1.5 or

773
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:44,831
Ruby React developer, or you
want to throw me into the

774
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:48,041
JavaScript stack, understanding
that I can learn it. And it's.

775
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:53,320
Like I've had good team
experiences and I've had

776
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,590
bad team experiences. I mean,
it's like having

777
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:58,420
the ability to like go to
somebody and go, I

778
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:02,141
don't get what's going on. So
like, that's what

779
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm looking for now. So I just
have to be able to

780
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:07,661
like go through everything and
just keep going.

781
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,650
But that's like somewhere where
my learning potential and

782
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,985
abilities there where I can.
Like I have the track record

783
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:23,755
to show that I can build stuff,
but also to understand that

784
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:28,496
look, he's still growing, but I
also have other skills,

785
00:42:24,056 --> 00:42:30,206
which is like somebody said
socialization as a service.

786
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:31,646
I'm still let them serve,
wrapping my

787
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:33,326
head around this thing. But
yeah.

788
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,635
Dan: you're looking for, you
know, a job or are you looking

789
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:44,335
for something where it's just
code or, um, like or something

790
00:42:44,335 --> 00:42:48,865
where you can use some more of
your, you know, communication

791
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:51,956
abilities and teaching
experience, stuff like that.

792
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:54,306
You know, cause there's some
jobs where even on a good team,

793
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,186
your job is really going to be
sitting and coding, you know?

794
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,766
Um, and there's some jobs, I
think we're probably, you're

795
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:01,536
going to be doing a little more
personal, you know,

796
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:06,115
interpersonal work with coding.
I just, I'm just curious if

797
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:07,666
like, if that's the sort of
thing you're like sifting

798
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:10,235
through you're searching for,
jobs or are you, um,

799
00:43:11,748 --> 00:43:14,688
Nerando: I think for, I think
for me right now, between

800
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:19,599
I'm like, I say 1.5. So between
1.5 and 2.5,

801
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:20,739
I'm going to spend a lot of time
honing my craft.

802
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:22,778
The trick is that I'm a social
person.

803
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:26,978
So between freeCodeCamp, which I
may step away from, but still

804
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:30,938
be an active participant in
.Virtual Coffee is not losing

805
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:34,789
me anytime with anytime soon. So
y'all life suck because

806
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:35,739
I'm going to join Mike as a hype
man, next.

807
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,559
I will do more teaching.
Teaching is second

808
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:46,434
nature to me because. There is
so much more persons

809
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:50,634
who need the knowledge who need
somebody to say,

810
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:51,864
Hey, um, this is how you do
this, or talk to me.

811
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:56,873
So I'll still be using my social
skills, but for a job job.

812
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:00,728
It might not be the top priority
when I write stuff if needed.

813
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:04,869
Yes. Will I be able to speak for
my company if the time comes.

814
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:08,918
Yes. But it might not be the
priority, but eventually I

815
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:12,219
think dev rel is looking really
interesting to me down the road.

816
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:14,416
Dan: That's kinda what I was
wondering if you were,

817
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,916
if you were starting to look at
any of those kinds

818
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:21,615
of positions, um, if, um, I
haven't like done a job

819
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:26,775
search for a while, you know? So
like, I don't know if those,

820
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:29,505
like, if devrel positions, I
don't even know, are There

821
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:31,155
a lot of, like, I don't know
what the landscape looks like

822
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:32,775
out there, you know, is there
just like a couple and they

823
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:33,826
get snatched up right away all
the time, or, you know,

824
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:38,789
Nerando: They are close  knit. I
think devrel people are

825
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:43,648
close, close knit group. So I
tend to, I know a couple

826
00:44:39,568 --> 00:44:45,929
of them and I talk to them from
time to time about the job, but

827
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:49,199
I think I wanted to spend more
time mastering my craft first

828
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:52,318
because to be able to speak to
the code and teach the code,

829
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,978
you have to know the code. It's
like science.

830
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:56,818
Like I was a middle school
science teacher for what,

831
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:01,313
eight and a half, nine years.
I've been a science nerd since

832
00:44:58,134 --> 00:45:02,934
I was about nine, so I can teach
science in my sleep.

833
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:08,543
So I know it's, I can teach it.
I need to know my craft a bit

834
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:11,393
more before I'm able to say,
Hey, we have this new tech

835
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:12,713
and this is how you use it. And
yeah.

836
00:45:14,153 --> 00:45:15,204
So yeah, stuff like that.

837
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,699
Bekah: I also think there's
something valuable about

838
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:21,818
people seeing you learn as you
go too, though, right?

839
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:25,119
Like, because sometimes it's
inaccessible to watch people

840
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,418
who know all the answers or who
get to places really quickly.

841
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:32,228
And so, I don't know. That's one
of the things that

842
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:35,438
I can appreciate about people
who are live streaming, their

843
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:38,818
coding process, because they're
working through these problems

844
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:40,318
at the same time, kind of that
you are as you're watching them.

845
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,548
Right. And it's nice to know
that,

846
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:46,829
all right, this wasn't super,
um, packaged and perfect.

847
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:49,289
There was a lot that went into
that process.

848
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:52,918
And so I do think that you can
hone your craft in some

849
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:55,739
way at the same time while
teaching other people in a

850
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:01,018
way that is really authentic.
Um, as opposed to like,

851
00:45:58,648 --> 00:46:03,148
oh, I've been doing this for a
long time and.

852
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:06,474
This is how it looks because
that's just not as

853
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:09,653
relatable to people who are
learning for the first time.

854
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,228
Nerando: True. I think you'd
literally

855
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,489
just did something that I've
been trying to avoid.

856
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:18,204
So I've been trying to avoid
tweeting out what I'm learning

857
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:21,474
every day and you just share,
enforced the idea that the

858
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,634
action we need to do it. So good
luck Twitter.

859
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:24,233
Here I come.

860
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:29,039
Dan: mean, I think it's good
advice.

861
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:32,518
I think it, I think writing and
sharing what you're

862
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:36,148
learning, even if you're not
going for a devrel like, like

863
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:40,179
even not to do with the devrel
in general, but said before

864
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:42,608
about how teaching helps you
learn and stuff like that.

865
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:45,668
And, think watching people's
journeys through

866
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:48,998
learning is, is great. It's
helpful for people

867
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,958
and it's helpful for people to
get to know you better.

868
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:54,018
I, you know, I feel like it's
helpful for, prospective

869
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,679
employers, you know, to
understand, um, where are you

870
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,588
at and to understand that you
are learning and the, you,

871
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,009
you know, like as opposed to, if
it's just a black box or

872
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:06,918
whatever, you know, then you'd
have to hope your resume.

873
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,409
I suppose, speaks, speaks
enough, you know,

874
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:12,268
Nerando: I think speaking to the
whole teaching,

875
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:15,657
what, you know, like it came
full circle to me too, is.

876
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:19,947
I had to help teach one of my
sisters how to drive and

877
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:23,338
driving to me is one of them
unfunded pleasures that I have,

878
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:27,088
but explaining to her how, what
works is, was totally different.

879
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:31,288
Also I'm a fan of the whole
Dresden Files book.

880
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:34,483
And there's a part in there
that, um, main character,

881
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:36,913
Harry, is teaching a new wizard,
how to be a wizard.

882
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:39,672
And he goes, it's all fun and
games until you have to

883
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:42,373
teach somebody, something new,
because now you have to

884
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:45,253
justify why you would prefer it
to have a conversation,

885
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,532
then curse somebody or something
to that effect.

886
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:50,043
And I'm like, yep. That's all

887
00:47:50,253 --> 00:47:55,617
Dan: I about that series. I
think I read the first

888
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:56,996
couple they were fun. And then I
about them.

889
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:01,226
Nerando: If you want, I'm not
going to throw any spoilers,

890
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:04,376
but Mouse is now terrifying. I
love Mouse.

891
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:09,061
Dan: well, after to swing back,
I think I have a,

892
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,556
Nerando: Um, I'm, I'm personally
waiting

893
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:12,996
for the next book. I have all of
them. Yeah.

894
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:21,679
Bekah: Okay. So I think that you
are always

895
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:26,329
super positive about things, but
I imagine that some point

896
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,588
you have been feeling lots of
challenges, too, right?

897
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:30,018
Like you made a lot of
transitions, a lot of changes,

898
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:34,159
you're looking for a job. So how
do you stay positive

899
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:36,438
through those challenges? Or
like what's your process

900
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:36,438
for working through that?

901
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:38,438
Nerando: I don't stay positive
some days I

902
00:48:38,438 --> 00:48:43,358
have really bad days. What I do
have is that

903
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:47,554
over the years I have had.
Really good people who

904
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:48,454
literally will watch out to see
if something is wrong.

905
00:48:48,483 --> 00:48:50,434
Like my friends know if I get
too quiet, they call.

906
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:54,034
So I build the network. I have
family support.

907
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:59,614
I have de-stressors. I have days
that I turn off.

908
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:04,833
It's hard. Like job searching is
hard

909
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:08,463
because after a while you feel
like I'm not good enough, I

910
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:10,653
have had those moments to go. I
quit.

911
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:17,119
I literally almost quit code
twice because I've put in so

912
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,528
much effort and time after a
while I'm like, okay.

913
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,958
But my, my, my support system
will go.

914
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:28,023
Go over there and cry. You get
10 minutes.

915
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:30,454
That's allyou get. Now. Let's
get back to work.

916
00:49:30,454 --> 00:49:31,923
And would you like ice cream or
coffee?

917
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:36,244
And I'm dead serious. I have
persons like those in my

918
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:37,684
life who stand up for me when I
can't stand up for myself.

919
00:49:38,253 --> 00:49:40,324
I'm a part of a community like
Virtual Coffee.

920
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:44,074
Like I go, I went quiet two
weeks ago and from Virtual

921
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:49,579
Coffee, Meg went, where are you?
And Mike did the hype man

922
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:52,938
thing and like a couple of my
other friends call and my

923
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:55,998
friend, I have a friend now who
I'm helping to learn code

924
00:49:52,969 --> 00:50:00,318
called G G has been my friends
since E in 17, so awhile.

925
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:03,469
And she'll reach out and see if
I'm okay.

926
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:06,208
And my other male, I have male
friends.I have female friends.

927
00:50:06,228 --> 00:50:10,128
And so we reach out and see,
who's what you're, it's never

928
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:14,659
going to be easy all the time.
And you just have to keep going.

929
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:18,929
You have to find your why. I
think while we were

930
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:19,728
at bootcamp, two persons point
this out to me.

931
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:24,409
Our lecturer back then, his name
is Brett Butler.

932
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:32,119
I think he's at condor right
now. Um, he pointed out that why

933
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:35,509
you are doing this is way more
important than how, how fast

934
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:38,358
or how much you learn, because
when I failed, my mod one, he

935
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:41,179
goes, you just need more time. I
thought this is a

936
00:50:38,778 --> 00:50:41,929
giant mistake and I don't know
how to do this.

937
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:44,036
He goes, you just need more
time. So sometimes you need more

938
00:50:44,036 --> 00:50:46,143
time.

939
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:48,224
Sometimes you're having
something else that's

940
00:50:48,403 --> 00:50:52,333
hindering what's going on.
Sometimes you just need somebody

941
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:56,954
to like, yeah, you need a
hype-man or a hype-person or

942
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:58,514
a mantra or like affirmations.
I'm old school.

943
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:00,463
So I will go pray. I will go
walk.

944
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:03,134
I'm like, okay, how do I do this
now? Okay.

945
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:07,244
But support system. And you
literally finding

946
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:10,603
your why the other person who
literally highlights all of this

947
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:13,844
was I remember I was taking a
train with my batchmate, then

948
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:17,264
Keisha, Keisha would read a book
called, um, Grit by Angela...

949
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,853
I think her name is  or
something I can't remember.

950
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:24,344
And I listened to the podcast
for it, and it was

951
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:27,943
basically understanding that all
everything you've

952
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:31,603
ever wanted to do is doable. You
just have to break them down.

953
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:35,983
So, no, you don't have good
days. You don't have it. Great.

954
00:51:36,014 --> 00:51:41,833
I'm not always super positive.
Sometimes I have bad days,

955
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:42,914
but I have, I've taken time to
build a support system.

956
00:51:43,664 --> 00:51:43,994
That's it?

957
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:48,059
Bekah: I think that's such great
advice.

958
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:50,849
And I think that's the thing
that nobody kind of

959
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:55,648
teaches you in school, right?
They, these are the subjects

960
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:59,728
and this is how you learn them.
But having that support

961
00:51:55,648 --> 00:52:01,139
system is so key to being able
to keep moving forward.

962
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,748
And I was having a rough day the
other day and

963
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:07,523
somebody in my Mom's in Tech
Slack group DMed me.

964
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:10,494
And just out of nowhere, just
to, you know,

965
00:52:10,523 --> 00:52:13,373
provide an affirmation about
what I was doing.

966
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:15,923
I was like, you don't even
realize how much

967
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:21,974
I needed that today. Um, But
it's such an

968
00:52:17,903 --> 00:52:23,083
undervalued thing and you do it
for so many people, too.

969
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,483
I mean, any conversation I have
with you is a good

970
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:29,804
conversation and I always feel
happy after I've seen you,

971
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:33,193
even if it's for like three
seconds and the big, the big

972
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:38,384
zoom room or whatever, but it's
always great to have you.

973
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:41,143
And I'm glad that you have a
support system that's

974
00:52:41,204 --> 00:52:44,954
able to take care of you. And
that you're open to

975
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:44,954
talking about that with us.

976
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,664
Nerando: um, I don't know how
much time we got left, but two

977
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:53,313
things you just mentioned, um,
please don't ever get me started

978
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:56,344
on talking about how horrible
school equipped us all for our

979
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:59,463
surviving as adults, because you
teach me math and not taxes.

980
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:03,634
I'm upset or support systems,
like stuff like that

981
00:53:03,634 --> 00:53:10,528
bothers me, but also like. A lot
of us keep not

982
00:53:07,648 --> 00:53:13,438
understanding that sometimes you
just need to reach out

983
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:15,719
to people like, yeah, just reach
out because you don't

984
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:16,918
know how much you saved them.
Like you don't.

985
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:23,032
Dan: Yeah, somebody else just
said the same kind of thing.

986
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:25,981
I think it was Gant , was saying
just, if you like a tweet even

987
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:28,581
or something was meaningful. Or
a blog posters, you

988
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:30,711
know, it's just like, send them
a message, send it,

989
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:32,512
send a quick one sentence, you
know,  I really like

990
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:33,771
this thing that you wrote, you
know, or I don't know.

991
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:37,791
I think that's important to you.
I it's something I, I don't

992
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:38,672
know, I forget to do or, or
struggle with doing.

993
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:42,052
And, um, but it's right. When
it, when it comes out of

994
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:45,831
nowhere, it's it's I dunno.
It's, it's always nice

995
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,954
to hear good things from people
from your friends

996
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:50,039
Bekah: Nerando, this has been
really great.

997
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:53,940
We appreciate you sharing with
us and we look forward

998
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,980
to seeing you at Virtual Coffee
in the future.

999
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,269
So thanks so much for being
here.

1000
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:57,905
Dan: Thanks, Nerando.

1001
00:53:58,394 --> 00:53:59,324
Nerando: No problem guys.

1002
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,179
Bekah: All right. Well, I'll
talk to you later.
