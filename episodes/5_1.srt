00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,340
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
Season Five, Episode One of the

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,070
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,800
that

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:18,062
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:19,291
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,520
their

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,371
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,582
stories and what they've learned
and we're here to share it with

9
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:29,202
you here with me. Today is my
cohost, Dan.

10
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:34,601
Dan: Yo what's up. We are back
season five, took a little break

11
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,251
off a couple of months off
there. Um, but now we're back.

12
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,901
We're

13
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,492
ready to get going again with
the new season, we have a bunch

14
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:41,082
of

15
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:45,322
great guests lined up and. I
don't know. I'm excited.

16
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,661
Bekah: Yeah. And it's not just
season five of the podcast,

17
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:47,831
we're

18
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:53,472
also rolling into year three of
Virtual Coffee, so I feel like

19
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:57,042
this is not only to be a fun
season, but a fun year for

20
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:57,792
Virtual Coffee.

21
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:05,162
Dan: Absolutely. Uh, three years
is a long time. I don't know.

22
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:07,731
We've been through a lot. I feel
like, I feel like I'm still

23
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:09,742
excited about the whole thing,
so I don't know.

24
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:13,796
Bekah: Yeah, I think, see, I
think the third year of Virtual

25
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:17,411
Coffee is really exciting
because we're kind of

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,026
established, we

27
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,876
know what we're doing, we know
who we are and now there's space

28
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:29,816
to grow and innovate and do new,
cool things. And I'm really

29
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:32,203
excited to be able to do that
and keep talking with the

30
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,590
members of

31
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:38,251
our community as we do that. And
a lot of the people that we have

32
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:42,542
on the podcast this season are
people who've been around a

33
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,371
while. Um, We, we have some
newer members too, but it's,

34
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,200
it's cool

35
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:50,072
to have that balance where
there's a different history of

36
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:51,871
Virtual Coffee that we're
talking about.

37
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:57,322
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I
agree. And it's cool to have all

38
00:01:57,322 --> 00:02:02,572
of that mix going on at Virtual
Coffee as well. That's cool. So,

39
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:04,837
yeah, we're gonna kick off
season five of the podcast with,

40
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:07,072
uh,

41
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:12,382
Brian Rinaldi. Um, Brian is a
developer experience engineer at

42
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,502
LaunchDarkly, um, and he's also
actively involved in the

43
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,227
community. He runs to some
developer meetups. One is called

44
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:21,867
cfe.dev. And he also runs a
local meetup, uh, Orlando Devs.

45
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,507
Um, he

46
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:26,201
edits newsletters. He authors,
he has co coauthored a book

47
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,895
about

48
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,666
JAMstack. Um, and he's just,
he's been around for a long time

49
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,436
and

50
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,257
it was a really great time
talking with him.

51
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,611
Bekah: I'm, I really enjoyed
this conversation with Brian

52
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,136
because I

53
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:42,747
use it as like my personal
mentoring session of how do you

54
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,646
DevRel, how has it changed? How
has community changed? And so,

55
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:50,067
um, really, we always start with
a list of questions, but I'm not

56
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,877
sure that I really looked at my
list as much as I was like, I

57
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:56,637
want to know more about this
thing. Please, please tell me

58
00:02:56,637 --> 00:03:02,081
about it. So, uh, we, we cover
all of those fun topics of

59
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,792
DevRel, what it is, how it's
changed and, uh, getting his

60
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:11,201
advice as an expert in the field
was really awesome.

61
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,336
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Okay,
we're going to take a quick

62
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:16,917
sponsor break and then we'll
hear from Brian Rinaldi.

63
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:21,044
Bekah: Looking for developer
centered online events? Want to

64
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:24,433
share your knowledge with the
developer community? Attend and

65
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:29,413
host online events at
codementor.io/events. That's

66
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,580
codementor.io/events. We start
every episode of the podcast

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,747
like

68
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,957
we start every Virtual Coffee.
We introduce ourselves with our

69
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,288
name, where we're from, what we
do and a random check-in

70
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:54,348
question. We hope you enjoy this
episode. Today's random check-in

71
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:59,868
question is: what is your
favorite genre of movie? My name

72
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:04,729
is Bekah. I am a technical
community builder from a small

73
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:11,149
town in Ohio. And my favorite
genre of movie. It's probably

74
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:15,679
action superhero movie. I feel
like those are the things that

75
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,603
can keep my attention long
enough to get to the end. Um,

76
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:21,527
uh, I like

77
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,399
a lot of TV shows and that, that
would be comedy, but that's not

78
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,869
the question. So.

79
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:35,348
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan. I do
computers. I was trying to think

80
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,833
of a new thing to say this this
season. And, uh, I didn't come

81
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,318
up

82
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,249
with anything. So I generally do
front-end stuff and I am in

83
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,269
Cleveland and, uh, yeah, I'd say
action-y you know, with, with

84
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:52,139
like, uh, like with the little
sci-fi touch, I think is my, my

85
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,439
sweet spot. You know, so not the
hard scifi stuff, but like Star

86
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,319
Wars even, you know, is like,
it's not really scifi it's, it's

87
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,879
more action in space, you know?
And like superheroes are cool. I

88
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,889
go along the same, same lines as
Bekah.

89
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,873
Brian: And hi, I'm Brian
Rinaldi. I'm based in Orlando,

90
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,273
Florida. I

91
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:14,923
am a developer experience
engineer at LaunchDarkly. And

92
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:18,132
this is a tough question for me
to answer, because like I was

93
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:21,947
thinking about it, I'm like, The
probably the best way to answer

94
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,007
is like, okay, what are my
favorite movies? And like all

95
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:28,548
time, it would be like, um,
Raiders of the lost Ark,

96
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:35,267
Ghostbusters, of the Rings
series. And, uh, and, um, well,

97
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,737
the Batman, one's not then more
recent Batman stuff. The, the,

98
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:40,937
uh,

99
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:41,617
Dan: Burton ones?

100
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,837
Brian: No, no, no, no. The
Batman Begins, and, uh, and, uh,

101
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,102
what

102
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,677
was it? Dark Knight, Dark
Knight. Christopher Nolan ones.

103
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:50,251
Yes,

104
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,262
exactly. I guess a lot of those
are action, but like

105
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:54,272
Ghostbusters

106
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:59,163
is comedy. I mean, Lord of the
Rings is kind of fantasy, so I

107
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,983
don't know. That's where I'm
like, okay. I don't really know

108
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,392
if I have a genre

109
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:08,237
Dan: How about adventure movies?
Like you said, a

110
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:09,798
Brian: Indiana Jones.

111
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,418
Dan: Jones made me think of
that. And then, you

112
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:12,197
Brian: Yeah.

113
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:14,208
Dan: maybe it doesn't quite fit
in there, but like

114
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:15,067
Bekah: of

115
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:15,798
Dan: it kind of, you

116
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,963
Bekah: we'll have those common
themes.

117
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:18,798
Dan: all good movies.

118
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:19,642
Bekah: Yeah.

119
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:22,148
Brian: So anyway, um,

120
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:22,913
Bekah: movies.

121
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:24,968
Brian: I think, I think, you
know, nowadays I ended up

122
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,017
watching a lot of action in
movies. but that's, I feel like

123
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:32,288
that's partly cause like That's.
almost all there is.

124
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:34,817
Dan: That's. Yeah, that's our
only choice.

125
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,788
Bekah: Well, welcome Brian. We
are very, very excited to have

126
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,827
you here with us today. I'm
talking about developer

127
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,866
advocacy,

128
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,177
advocacy, um, fostering
community, what you're doing

129
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,277
with

130
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:51,557
cfe.dev, we always want to start
with origin stories here. So why

131
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:55,812
don't you give us your, how you
got to this point in your life.

132
00:06:56,398 --> 00:07:03,608
Brian: Hmm. Well, um, I'm old,
first of all. So I got my, I got

133
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:07,008
started in web development, uh,
in like the mid nineties and,

134
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,408
um,

135
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,542
and this was during the dot com
boom. And I started, I think,

136
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,777
uh,

137
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,198
started messing around with
flash early flash and, and, uh,

138
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,548
cold

139
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:23,142
fusion and in stuff like that.
And a buddy of mine helped me

140
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,736
get

141
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,545
a job at a startup. Cold Fusion
development and kind of went

142
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:31,353
from

143
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:36,663
there. Um, but how I got into
like developer advocacy is, is I

144
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:41,523
was, I was started writing
articles and running user groups

145
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:42,812
and meetups while we didn't call
them meet ups back then, which

146
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,072
is

147
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,793
called the user groups. But I
ran user groups and, and I ran

148
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:51,572
conferences and stuff like that.
Most of them around like Adobe

149
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,412
products. And then I got hired
by Adobe to do community

150
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:57,252
management

151
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:03,132
and, and, uh, well, call it
evangelism, I guess back then,

152
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,687
uh, we kind of dropped that
term, which I think is for the

153
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:05,942
best.

154
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:06,913
Um,

155
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,737
Dan: I haven't heard that one
for a, but

156
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:13,723
Brian: Yeah. So that was like,
12, 13 years ago, something like

157
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:19,692
that. I don't know. Um, and I've
been doing devrel-ish jobs ever

158
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,487
since I, cause you know,
devrel's one of those areas

159
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,282
where like

160
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,033
everybody has a different take
on it and everybody's role is

161
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,898
kind

162
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,817
of different. So I've had very
different roles. Some of them

163
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,736
are

164
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:35,097
straight devrel of like, you
know, you're kind of speaking at

165
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,077
conferences, writing blog posts,
and some of them were more

166
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:39,057
behind

167
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:41,232
the scenes, like handling
content and stuff like that, but

168
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,407
always

169
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:48,778
in a very similar, Um, devrel
adjacent kind of role.

170
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:54,177
Bekah: It seems like you've been
in devrel since the beginning of

171
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:56,217
devrel, right. Like right as
that started to pick up and I'm

172
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:58,257
sure

173
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:01,258
it's changed a lot. What do you
think the biggest changes have

174
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:01,557
been.

175
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:06,352
Brian: Oh, God. Yeah, I mean, I
guess it was very early days of

176
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,873
devrel at the time that I got
into it. It was like, it was

177
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:11,663
like, Okay. there's a handful of
companies. And most of them were

178
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:17,432
big. Um, you know, Microsoft,
Google, uh, I had like some

179
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,452
devrel folks, but like most
companies did not have several

180
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:27,182
folks. Um, I think it was, seems
kind of superfluous. Uh, and now

181
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:30,482
I, one of the big things that's
changed is you see companies

182
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:33,332
they're startups and there, they
don't even have a marketing

183
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,702
department yet. They don't,
haven't even done their first

184
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,513
marketing hire. Their first
marketing hire is a devrel

185
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,253
person, right. They're like,
Okay. This person can handle all

186
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:47,202
the community things and can be.
Nope, authentic voice is this

187
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:51,432
kind of, you know, the, the term
that's used. And, and so like,

188
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,172
I've even had some of those
roles where I'm sending email

189
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,882
campaigns

190
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,493
and stuff like that, which would
normally be a marketing person's

191
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:02,623
job. But, but we don't have a
marketing person yet. So, um,

192
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,832
that's definitely a big change.
So like every company seems to

193
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:08,712
kind of come out the gate. If
they're focused on developers,

194
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:11,982
they want to have a devrel
person right off the bat. And so

195
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:15,162
lots of

196
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,427
jobs in it, whereas before it
was very hard to break into. Um,

197
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,691
and,

198
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:21,368
and one of the great things
about that is there's a lot of

199
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,873
room for

200
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,682
varied levels of experience.
Because back when I got into it,

201
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,737
you had to already be kind of
like a known entity and have

202
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,792
been

203
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:35,712
around for a long time. And,
and, and this kind of limited

204
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:38,053
opportunities, I think for it
was a very well, the industry as

205
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,363
a

206
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,860
whole was. White male centric.
It's still is unfortunately,

207
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,357
but,

208
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:49,618
but even more so like that
limited opportunities, I think

209
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,737
for lots of people who, you
know, it basically leaned very

210
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,856
heavily

211
00:10:55,857 --> 00:11:00,883
towards um, white males because
that what they were looking for

212
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:04,873
was people who are already
well-known in that field. And it

213
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:10,003
was very hard to find women and
who were known. So I think

214
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:15,597
having, having it opened up to
different experiences and. The

215
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:20,488
types of people, not just the
road warrior as I call them who

216
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:23,248
would go to conferences and
conference to conference, to

217
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:27,807
conference and speak, which is
also a hard life that only fits

218
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,012
certain people. So, um, you
know, that's changed. And so I

219
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,217
think

220
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:35,307
we've, we've now opened it up to
like, it's a, it's a completely

221
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:39,418
different field, um, in many
ways. And, and, and for the

222
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:39,748
better.

223
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:44,317
Bekah: Yeah, that's great. And I
mean, the pandemic of course has

224
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,027
had a big impact on what it
looks like too. It's just

225
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,737
constantly

226
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:48,248
shifting.

227
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:52,518
Brian: Absolutely right. I mean,
you know, especially for those

228
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,248
people who, whose job was to go
from conference to conference

229
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,727
conference, like it didn't, it
wasn't even there. It's still

230
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,632
really, isn't, there's very few
in-person conferences. So you

231
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,537
had

232
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:03,378
to kind of adjust.

233
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,702
Bekah: Yeah, somebody online
who's in devrel was saying it

234
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,547
was

235
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:13,197
a tweet that DevRel people in
devrel need to really focus on

236
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,102
upping their video game because
they thought that was going to

237
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,977
be

238
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:20,817
the next big thing. like, how do
I, I don't want to learn how to

239
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,027
edit a video. I just figured out
how to. Use a microphone and

240
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:27,237
have

241
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:29,397
a camera that's not connected to
my laptop. So I feel like

242
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,556
there's

243
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:34,408
just always so much to learn,
which makes it simultaneously

244
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,827
fun. But also like there are all
these other skills that you have

245
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,187
to bring with.

246
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,647
Brian: Yeah. And, but I think,
you know, the good companies

247
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,117
that

248
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:46,677
do this, understand that not
everybody has, like, you can't

249
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:50,832
find very many people. I mean,
there are people. Seemingly good

250
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:55,273
at everything. Um, and you know,
and I love those people and hate

251
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:59,623
those people at the same time.
But, uh, but you know, it's

252
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:02,472
really hard to find somebody
who's like good at writing. Good

253
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:07,462
at video. Good at public
speaking, you know, Um, And so I

254
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:12,743
think that the companies that do
this right. what you're, you

255
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:16,493
know, kind of build on your
strengths. Right. me personally,

256
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:20,393
I'm also not, I can do videos. I
don't consider myself a

257
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:25,187
particularly good at video
person. I, it, it drives me

258
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:29,327
crazy. I love to write, uh, and
I love to run events and things

259
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:31,082
like that. And so like, you
know, when I've had the roles

260
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:32,837
I've had

261
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:35,868
played to those strengths,
particularly when I'm at a

262
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,847
company that knows how I, I feel
like does differ. All right.

263
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,826
Then

264
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:43,307
they play to your strengths and
don't necessarily feel like,

265
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:47,268
okay, you can't do video. You're
failing in some way. And, um,

266
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,488
because you can't get everything
out of a single person. That's

267
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:55,087
why you have, you have a team
and different people have those

268
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,337
different strengths and we play
to those strengths.

269
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:59,659
Bekah: Yeah, so, okay. So I'm
going to back up kind of a

270
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,339
little

271
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:07,068
bit five years ago, maybe now.
Um, you, so in the midst of all

272
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:11,658
of this, you also started
cfe.dev. So why don't you talk a

273
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:15,678
little bit about what that is
and why you started doing that?

274
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:21,469
Brian: Yeah. So cfe.dev, uh it's
yeah. It's about five years ago.

275
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:28,114
I started it. And it's all
virtual events. Um, it's we run

276
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:34,894
two virtual meetups a month. Uh,
and then I also run obviously

277
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:38,104
virtual conferences and stuff
like thejam.dev, which has

278
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:41,164
finished yesterday, um, and moar
serverless and, and other, I

279
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:44,224
have

280
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:48,364
flashback conference as well,
which was. Well, that one wasn't

281
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:52,653
person, but, Um, what's my one
in person events running under

282
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:55,569
cfe.dev. But anyway, uh, and
yeah, so this was before

283
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,264
pandemic

284
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:04,024
forced us to go virtual. Uh, I,
I was, uh, I love running events

285
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:08,283
and I wanted to do some more of
it and I just kind of like,

286
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,604
honestly, it was initially
supposed to be in-person events

287
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:17,014
and then the in-person events
are. They're a heavy lift and

288
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:19,353
they're expensive and, and
risky. And so I was like, oh,

289
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,692
you know

290
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:25,264
what, I'll start running some
virtual events and like in build

291
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:30,183
an audience and then run, uh, an
in-person event, you know, Um,

292
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:31,728
using, you know, kind of, I
already have an audience and

293
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,062
then

294
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:36,394
I'll maybe they'll come to my
in-person event. And it

295
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,238
transitioned to be like, okay,
you know, virtual events

296
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,082
actually

297
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,484
aren't that bad. I was not a
believer. I was like, I'll do

298
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,948
them just because. And then
there, there are things that

299
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:49,788
virtual events are great at. Um,
they're not great at everything

300
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:54,438
and you know, that interpersonal
react interaction. They're not

301
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,244
right. Although you all run one
that does do that well, uh,

302
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,719
which

303
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:02,688
goes to show you can do it, but
it's hard to do. It's, it's hard

304
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:04,308
to get everything out of one
event, like to get great

305
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,928
speakers

306
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:10,653
and interpersonal reaction, like
interactions and stuff like. Um,

307
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,203
but they are good. Like for
instance, one of the things I

308
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:16,894
love about running the online
conferences is people get to

309
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,413
interact with the speaker, even
if it's via chat and ask their

310
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,083
questions. But like asking
questions in an in real life

311
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:27,583
event is super, like, it just
never works out well. Right?

312
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,734
people start leaving at the end
when the speakers taking

313
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:35,264
questions and it's, you can't
hear the questioner and things

314
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:39,703
like that, like it's just never
really worked out. Um, But you

315
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:43,274
can get, you know, kind of
directly with the speaker in the

316
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,014
virtual event. Like ask, get
your question to answer it and

317
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:46,754
have a

318
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:52,303
good conversation. Um, when it's
not prerecorded, um, open it up

319
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,124
to speakers who are anywhere in
everywhere and get speakers who

320
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,394
you might otherwise get, because
it would be too, or complicated,

321
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:05,183
or they can't travel. Um, You
know, or, you know, and you can

322
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,668
get attendees from anywhere,
right? Like if they don't have

323
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,153
to

324
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,939
travel, they can the events are
free. So there's a lot of great

325
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,808
things about them. I, and, and
this is coming from somebody who

326
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:20,378
started this as a complete
skeptic. I was like, yeah,

327
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,059
virtual events suck. But, uh,
you know, I'll run, I'll run

328
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,709
some

329
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,084
and, you know, cause it's, it's
a way to get started. And then

330
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:28,459
now

331
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:29,219
I'm fully committed.

332
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:33,813
Dan: That's that's it's really
cool. I mean, it's, it's really,

333
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,242
I've been a fan of, uh, what
you've been doing at CFE for

334
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:38,862
awhile. And obviously we do a
lot of virtual events well. Um,

335
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:41,482
I

336
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:45,482
kind of actually, it was going
to swing back. I had a question

337
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,813
stick in my head. I want to ask
it before I forget, but, um, so

338
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:53,143
it's. When you were telling me,
um, your origin story, you were

339
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:55,393
talking about how you've had
these communities that you

340
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:57,047
created your user groups, um,
way back, you know, when they

341
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,691
were

342
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:03,553
still user groups. Right. And,
um, and I think that's really

343
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,712
interesting. I mean, I, I,
haven't heard of a lot of, um,

344
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,133
You know, current devrels that
have that sort of experience,

345
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,633
you

346
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,482
know? And so I, I guess one of
the things I was wondering was

347
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:17,022
like, what, you know, Bekah
asked, what, what changed? Um, I

348
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,462
was wondering like, what what
has stayed the same? Like what

349
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,902
are

350
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:22,047
some through lines you've seen,
um, from running communities,

351
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,191
you

352
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:27,792
know, over however long, that's
been 20, 30 years not to put a

353
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:28,542
number on it, but

354
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:30,553
Brian: not quite 30 yet.

355
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:31,303
Dan: Yeah.

356
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:37,303
Brian: Um, so, you know, luckily
people can't see me and tell me

357
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:46,752
the hell. Wow. Yeah. he's old.
But, uh, um, you know, well that

358
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,833
part of it hasn't changed like,
like the, the need for like

359
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,488
local, you know, for developers
to kind of meet up in person.

360
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:56,113
Um,

361
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,348
we, we don't call it. User
groups so much anymore. We, we

362
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,553
call them

363
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,502
meetups, but like, would they
still exist? And they're still,

364
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,451
I

365
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,807
think, an important part of, of
building a developer

366
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,162
communities,

367
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:14,278
particularly. Uh, on a more like
local level, like, you know, I

368
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,368
run one here called Orlando
devs. Um, and, and we're

369
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:20,458
probably the

370
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,887
biggest, we're the biggest
developer group here. I think

371
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:26,907
we're like 6,000 members, which
surprises people when they hear

372
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:28,932
Orlando, they don't think like
we have a big developer

373
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,537
community.

374
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:37,948
Um, but, uh, But yet it's, it's
very different because while I

375
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:41,998
love the virtual events, I think
we still need to kind of meet up

376
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:46,018
in person. Right. And, and so
like I started running when

377
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,787
pandemic came, I ran some
virtual events for Orlando devs,

378
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,437
and I

379
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,698
was like, it's weird. Cause I
love virtual events, but like

380
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,603
this doesn't work for, for
meetup, for my meet local

381
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,478
meetup,

382
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,557
because these are people I just,

383
00:19:58,928 --> 00:19:59,048
Dan: Yeah.

384
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:02,472
Brian: want to meet in person. I
mean, the speaker is. I love the

385
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:04,422
speakers, but like, I go there
to see the people then they hit

386
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:06,372
the

387
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,282
speaker, the speaker. Whereas I
go to the online event to hear

388
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:12,163
the speaker and then, hopefully
meet some people it's kind of

389
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:15,722
like flipping it. So I think
that's a through line that, that

390
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:19,444
has stuck. Um, You know, I
think, know, we, a lot of, a lot

391
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:23,156
of it,

392
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,637
things haven't really changed
that much in the fact that like,

393
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:31,468
you know, the in-person events
for devrel stuff is still

394
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,437
important. I think, you know,
Um, there's developers have, I

395
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:37,406
think,

396
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:40,887
as a community, have a real need
to kind of connect, I think,

397
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:45,718
because this is a hard job and
as Bekah noted takes constant

398
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:49,377
learning. Um, and so like we're
always connecting to try and

399
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:54,028
learn from each other and, and
get new techniques and learn

400
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:56,060
about new tools. And because.
You know, it's not the kind of

401
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,092
job

402
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:03,073
you can rest on your laurels, as
I say. Um, so, so all of that's

403
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:07,952
kind of the same. Um, the
technology has changed and, and

404
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:11,843
it's expanded, but, but it's not
that different. I mean,

405
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:15,688
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That's that's
interesting. Yeah. I, I noticed

406
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:20,982
the same thing. We had, I run a
react meetup in Cleveland and

407
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,917
it's pretty new, you know, but
it was in person and we did the

408
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,822
same

409
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:27,843
thing. We started trying to do
virtual events. Um, yeah, never,

410
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:32,323
never had the same feel. You
know? The, the people that would

411
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,402
show up were we're the diff
we're different people. I think,

412
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:34,481
you

413
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:40,067
know, some people want to have
the in-person stuff and. You

414
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:43,428
know, it was, yeah. It never,
um, never felt right now. That's

415
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,887
interesting. And then you're
going to, you can find good

416
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:51,018
virtual events. Uh, but I feel
like the ones that have the ones

417
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,807
that have started fresh during
the pandemic are almost almost a

418
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,502
better, uh, in better shape,
just because, um, they start

419
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:57,197
with that

420
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,627
in mind, you know, if that makes
sense, um,

421
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:04,188
Brian: Absolutely. I've watched,
cause one of the goals of, of

422
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:08,952
Orlando Devs is for actually a
not not-for-profit. um, Like we,

423
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:13,992
when we fund other local groups.
And so, like, I kind of have my,

424
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:18,462
know, kind of eye on all the
local groups and a lot of the

425
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,337
other local meetups went away
completely. Like they tried to

426
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:22,212
do

427
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:27,313
the virtual thing when this went
on much longer, that it just was

428
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,952
hard to kind of keep that
momentum going. And so

429
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:30,363
Bekah: Okay.

430
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:32,722
Brian: hard to run the meetup.
Number one, like, I mean, it's,

431
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,990
it's a lot of effort. Um, and
yeah. To run a meetup and try

432
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,258
and

433
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:39,042
keep that momentum virtually,
uh, when you really just want to

434
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,826
meet

435
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,678
the people in person is,
difficult.

436
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,212
Bekah: Um, I, I'm going to
circle back a little bit to when

437
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:47,757
I met

438
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:49,962
you, Brian, um, as you're
talking about this idea of

439
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,166
developers,

440
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:56,097
they need community, they need
support. Right. And I had, I

441
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:58,887
don't know when we first met
Virtual Coffee had been going on

442
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:01,077
for awhile. And, you know, if
you know about Virtual Coffee,

443
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:03,267
it was

444
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,608
not an intentional group or
community that started it just

445
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,948
of

446
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:11,518
started from tweet and went from
there and we just kept doing it.

447
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:15,718
Right. And so it was all of his
learning as I was going along.

448
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,057
And people were like, well, why
don't you do this? I'm like,

449
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:22,317
well, okay, we'll do that too.
Um, but then at some point I

450
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,447
think it Meg Gutshall going to
be on this season of the podcast

451
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,577
to

452
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:31,627
Hey, there's a meetup that's
awesome. It happens on Thursdays

453
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:35,228
at the same time as Virtual
Coffee and, and we can't ever,

454
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:39,307
like, I can't do both. So why
don't you figure something out?

455
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:45,788
And I'm like, oh, okay. so you
and I met up and I just remember

456
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:47,437
it being such a good meeting for
me because I'd been going

457
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:49,086
through

458
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:51,798
all of this community building
and didn't really know exactly

459
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,978
what I was doing. And, you know,
there were good things that were

460
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,827
happening. There were things
that were frustrating or felt

461
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,297
overwhelming. And you were the
first person that I really got

462
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,767
to

463
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,062
talk to about that. I talking to
you, like, why, why are you

464
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,356
doing

465
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:09,107
cfe.dev? Cause I was still like
trying to figure out, like, why

466
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:12,137
am I doing Virtual Coffee? I
mean, it made sense, right?

467
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:15,557
Because I love the community and
I loved being able to learn and

468
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:19,712
grow with. But so many people
kept telling you, they're like,

469
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,492
it is not reasonable for you to
be doing Virtual Coffee. And I'm

470
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:27,077
like, is it? Like, who can I
talk to about this? And so I

471
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:30,662
very much

472
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:33,503
appreciated being able to have
that support and talk openly

473
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:36,163
with

474
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:38,653
you about that. I don't know how
I came off in that meeting,

475
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,312
probably came off like I was
falling off the deep end a

476
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,711
little

477
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:46,583
bit, but, but I, I appreciate
it, like being able to have that

478
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,732
support as a community builder
with someone else that had, you

479
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:51,623
know, talked about those things.

480
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:54,587
Brian: Thanks. I, I mean, I
don't recall it being, I

481
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:56,162
remember it

482
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,038
being a great conversation, so,
you know, it's nice for me.

483
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,913
Cause

484
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,113
I honestly like, even though
I've been doing this a long

485
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:02,313
time, I

486
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:04,563
don't have a lot of people I
could talk to about it. Most of

487
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:08,163
the people really, you know, I
don't know a lot of people who

488
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:12,603
run communities like Virtual
Coffee or like CFE dev or even,

489
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:16,448
even meetups. I mean, it's a
small. Group of people often,

490
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,682
even your local meetups are
often like run by like the same

491
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,497
handful

492
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:22,687
of people who run multiples.
Right. Because they just, um,

493
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,876
and

494
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:28,238
it's people who are passionate
about communities because you

495
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:33,367
certainly don't do it for the
glory or the money. Um, because

496
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:38,123
if you're waiting for those,
those. They don't really come

497
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:43,432
with with that. Um, you know, so
you just really gotta, you gotta

498
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,517
love doing it. I mean, every
time I ran, for instance, every

499
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,602
time I

500
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:50,992
ran a conference, you know, I'd
be like, why do I put myself

501
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:54,653
through this? Why do I do this?
It's so stressful. It's so, and

502
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,502
then, uh, and then it was like
the, it came in. It's like, Oh,

503
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:01,012
my God, this is so awesome. I
loved seeing everybody. I loved

504
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:06,603
hearing the speakers and, you
know, um, And so, so then, then

505
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:09,232
I'll do it all over again and
I'll go through that same

506
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:10,612
process, even though I've been
doing it, like for like 15

507
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,992
years,

508
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:15,202
it's the same process. Why did I
do this? Why did I get myself

509
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:20,363
into it? Um, so it's, I think,
you know, being a community

510
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:23,243
organizer like that, like is,
is, uh, involves feeling like

511
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:26,123
you're

512
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:28,103
going to quit, all the time-

513
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:29,248
Bekah: Yeah.

514
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:32,512
Brian: -had it, this is too
much. And, know, and I think

515
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:35,752
people

516
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:39,778
also don't realize like kind of
the demands put, you know, they,

517
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:41,033
they want to share their ideas
and they're passionate about

518
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,288
your

519
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:42,678
community

520
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:43,048
Bekah: Yeah.

521
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:45,948
Brian: then you have all these
input coming as the community

522
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:48,948
grows, like from all over the
place. And it's like, okay, I

523
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:51,873
can't, I can't please,
everybody. Um, so. Yeah, it's,

524
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,798
it's not

525
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:01,607
easy. and so I, I totally, I
totally get you. And I'm amazed

526
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,752
by what you all have done with
Virtual Coffee. I mean, you

527
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,897
know,

528
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:09,498
the you've got a really, really
great community there. I think

529
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:09,667
Bekah: Oh,

530
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,917
Brian: it feels, uh, you clearly
found.

531
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:14,498
Bekah: yeah.

532
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:18,472
Brian: A kind of gap in what
people needed, right? Like in,

533
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,982
especially during the pandemic,
but obviously I think you're

534
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:27,403
going to live well beyond the
pandemic, which is just. An easy

535
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,383
way to kind of connect with
other developers. And it's a

536
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,363
very

537
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:34,452
casual kind of friendly
atmosphere. And, and I, you

538
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,031
know,

539
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:40,903
and nobody's afraid to kind of
share their struggles or, you

540
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:45,008
know, talk about, Um, you know,
the they're working on and be

541
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:47,108
open with with everybody else. I
mean, and that's very, very

542
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:49,208
rare.

543
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:55,057
I mean, Um, You know, even, even
when, when I've run, like the

544
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:58,178
in-person ones, right? Like, and
we all kind of know each other

545
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,538
right. In, it's just like, I'm
running this thing. And I got

546
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,778
speaker lined up and everybody
comes in this room and it's like

547
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:09,292
sitting there and I'm like, you
all talk to each other? Please

548
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,332
just can somebody just, you
know, speak to another person

549
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,281
here

550
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:16,163
instead of sitting in the chair,
waiting for the speaker to come.

551
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:22,613
I mean, that's the point of this
you know, Um, so, so find that

552
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,792
you've created a space where
people feel open to talk like,

553
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:28,238
Nope, I've never been there
where like people don't share.

554
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:30,653
Um, so

555
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:34,462
that's honestly, that's amazing,
you know, you've done something

556
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:34,823
special.

557
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:37,857
Bekah: Thank you means a lot.

558
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,452
Dan: Oh, no, I was just, I was
still just laughing about the,

559
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:49,012
the, you wanting to scream at
people to talk to each other. I

560
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:52,792
tried to solve that with a pizza
and would just come and get

561
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,173
pizza, and then sit back down
their seat.

562
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,103
Brian: I know.

563
00:28:56,913 --> 00:29:00,002
Dan: just, just I'm putting all
the chairs away. Just talk.

564
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:06,607
Bekah: I, I've gone to a couple
of in-person conferences in the

565
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:08,392
last couple of months. And you
know, that idea of meeting

566
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:10,177
people

567
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:14,798
in person and talking about that
being important. I like, I very

568
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,268
much felt that at one of the
conferences, for sure, because I

569
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:22,147
met other people who were doing
like small community building,

570
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:27,157
like we're doing, and to be able
to talk to them and hear, you

571
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:28,477
know, what they're going
through. And that really

572
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:29,797
resonated

573
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:32,275
because. We are all feeling the
same thing. And I continually

574
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:34,752
try

575
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:38,292
and go back to the spot of like,
how do we all figure out how to

576
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:42,012
support each other? Because I
think small communities are

577
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:43,873
really important because you get
to have those open

578
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:45,583
conversations,

579
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,782
like rather than jumping into a
slack of 6,000 people or, you

580
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:54,623
know, whatever that.
Automatically overwhelming, but

581
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:55,972
you know, finding, trying to
figure out these ways. I

582
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:57,291
haven't,

583
00:29:57,353 --> 00:29:59,992
uh, haven't figured it out yet.
So if anyone has ideas, let me

584
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:05,452
know. Uh, but it is nice to be
able to have those conversations

585
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,152
openly with people that, that
you wouldn't see normally, or,

586
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:10,762
you

587
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:14,573
know, I met someone. One of the
things that he does best is

588
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:15,772
connect other people at
conferences. He's not running

589
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,971
the

590
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:18,967
conference, he's just making
sure people meet each other and

591
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,962
can

592
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:23,903
have those important and
pertinent conversations. And

593
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:29,153
that's allowed for a ton of
growth and in a way that I would

594
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:33,863
be hard to have somewhere else
because you're just spending so

595
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:37,673
much time with people over a
period of 48 hours or whatever,

596
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:43,942
um, that it just like, I dunno,
There's a different energy and

597
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,413
investment into it. I think

598
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:49,877
Brian: yeah. Yeah. Couple of
in-person conferences too. Um,

599
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,817
since things have eased up and
how so think when, when you go

600
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,487
to

601
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,357
these, they're not, they're
smaller than they were before,

602
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:03,258
which isn't necessarily bad. I
mean, it's tougher on the

603
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:05,117
conference organizers because,
you

604
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:05,452
Bekah: yeah.

605
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,198
Brian: they still need to kind
of, uh, you know, keep

606
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:09,423
Bekah: know.

607
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:15,603
Brian: the black, you know, not
lose, lose their shirts. Um, but

608
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:19,502
it's, it's kinda good for, for
the attendees because like, you

609
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,992
know, everybody there is like
there because they are eager

610
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:24,482
meet

611
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,192
and talk to people. And so,
like, I found it to be

612
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,902
different, like

613
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,522
conferences before, especially
as there were bigger, it's like,

614
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:31,022
oh,

615
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,987
I go with a group, maybe a
couple of colleagues I kind of

616
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:34,952
stick

617
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:36,512
with that group and I never
really get to interact with

618
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,072
other

619
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:40,563
people outside of that. And it's
hard to kind of break people out

620
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:45,557
of those little groups that they
came in. Um, but the people at

621
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:49,337
events I've gone to, like more
recently, like they were there

622
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:51,092
because they're the kind of
people like first is a minute,

623
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,847
it

624
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,728
opens up even a little bit. I
want to go out and meet people.

625
00:31:56,478 --> 00:32:00,077
so it was, it was kind of, you
know, it was neat to be able to

626
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:03,817
kind of in a small group and be
with people who like really.

627
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:08,752
wanted to kind of get out and,
and meet other people and we're

628
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,792
open to new conversations. Um,
but I think, you know, as we

629
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,832
open

630
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:16,282
up more, we're going to have to
find ways to kind of keep that

631
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:21,262
connection going as the events
bigger. And, and, and that's

632
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:23,232
always the tough part, right?
Like every community. That

633
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,202
starts

634
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:28,083
small. And it's like, this is so
awesome. I'm meeting so many

635
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,312
great people. And then the
bigger and the bigger it gets,

636
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:30,541
it's

637
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:34,952
like, oh wow. Now it's gotten to
be a lot of noise. And it's hard

638
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,752
to like, know, I don't know as
many people and the people I

639
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,552
used

640
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:43,353
to know don't show up anymore.
And, you know, it's, it's the

641
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:46,863
hard part about keeping a
community going for a long time,

642
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:51,173
like in and growing it without
losing. What it was that made it

643
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:56,063
special, um, that, you know,
I've seen, I've seen a lot of

644
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:57,547
communities kind of struggle
with that and I've even

645
00:32:57,547 --> 00:32:59,031
struggled with

646
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:02,792
it myself. Um, you know, like
particularly the Orlando Devs

647
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:05,618
that got, it's gotten really
big, like it's, it's hard. Um,

648
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:08,423
and so,

649
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:13,762
yeah. Um, I guess I don't have
any, any special answers I

650
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,952
sympathize with-- I'm always
figuring it out myself.

651
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:19,702
Dan: Ah, it's really hoping
you're about to solve all of our

652
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:20,542
problems.

653
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:26,438
Brian: I think we, you know, we
solve it together, right. Like,

654
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:29,708
you know, we all know each other
and we share our struggles and

655
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,688
like, you know, we can help
solve it together.

656
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,702
Bekah: So I was talking to some
other small, uh, community

657
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:36,427
organizers, and I said, you
know, what, if we all just get

658
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,152
into a

659
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,613
meeting and we talk this out and
they're like, that sounds

660
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:41,633
dangerous. Like,

661
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:41,877
Brian: Yeah.

662
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:42,728
Dan: Okay.

663
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:44,722
Bekah: all right, maybe we need
an agenda. Uh, I think, you

664
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,252
know,

665
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:48,923
the other, the other thing that
I see with communities that have

666
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:51,023
been around for a long time,
they can be really great. But I

667
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:53,123
think

668
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:57,682
sometimes you have those groups
of people that are always there

669
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:59,137
and they continue to come to
those things. And if you're a

670
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,592
new

671
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:04,782
person, You don't feel like you
belong in those situations or,

672
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:06,162
you know, there's there's
assumptions. They, there's

673
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:07,511
almost

674
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:15,148
a, uh, They're not able to look
at the thing that they've built

675
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:19,077
the community and say, you know,
how are we welcoming new people

676
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:22,438
who don't feel like they're part
of this club? Because so many of

677
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:26,277
the people that are there are
part of that club. And for me,

678
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:27,747
like that's really hard,
especially in person

679
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:29,217
conferences.

680
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:33,478
I am afraid of strangers. And so
I don't talk to anyone unless

681
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:35,045
they talk to me first. So I just
like, sit there. And try and

682
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:36,612
make

683
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,067
eye contact with people and
like, hope someone takes pity on

684
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,522
me and

685
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:44,293
they talk to me. Uh, but, but
when everybody is all in their

686
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:49,722
own groups and there's not an
opening for you to kind of step

687
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,462
into, there are a couple of
times I like tried to jump in

688
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:53,202
and eat

689
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:56,262
like lunch with people at a
conference recently. And they're

690
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,322
like, got up two minutes later,
like, all right, see you later.

691
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:04,913
And then I was like, At my table
by myself, I guess I think that

692
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:07,012
there are ways around that. And
like, I've talked to a couple of

693
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:08,947
conference organizers now about
like, how do we make it

694
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,882
welcoming

695
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:15,682
for new people in these spaces?
But I think it's that you just

696
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,067
have to constantly be
evaluating, you know, w what is

697
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,452
it like to be

698
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,992
a new person? And it's not just
conferences and communities, you

699
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:29,527
know, it's jobs and, and school
groups or whatever else. It can

700
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,427
always be hard.

701
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,242
Brian: Yeah. Absolutely. And
there's, I don't know that

702
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:37,813
there's any magic solution. I
think think organizers have to,

703
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,402
you know, as an organizer, you,
you try to create spaces that in

704
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:46,693
opportunities that give people
room to meet other people when,

705
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:51,172
if they, um, And then I think
people like the person you met,

706
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,413
you need kind of people there
who, and often the conference

707
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,773
organizer is that person as
well. Like you can know all the

708
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,587
different people in like, oh,
Bekah, you should meet

709
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:01,401
so-and-so.

710
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:06,893
Um, come here and join us for,
you know, uh, whatever coffee or

711
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:12,023
a drink or whatever it is. Yeah.
You know, so that you, and then,

712
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:14,017
you know, cause oftentimes all
it takes is that first

713
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,772
introduction.

714
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:18,202
And then that person introduces
you to other people who

715
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:20,302
introduced the other people. And
then all of a sudden it's like,

716
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:25,702
Okay. I met so many new people,
but um, but you need to have

717
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:31,043
people there who can kind of
help. And I don't want to, I

718
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:33,382
think it's it's you gotta
there's people like you who, who

719
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:35,721
want to

720
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:40,583
meet people, but are. A little
shy about doing it. And then

721
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,032
there's people who like, you
know, aren't really, so you got

722
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:47,632
to kind of know that they've
not, they, they, they're not as

723
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:50,572
comfortable in those situations
and they're not, you know, so

724
00:36:50,572 --> 00:36:52,027
maybe they don't actually want
to meet people. So you have to

725
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:53,482
kind

726
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,838
of gauge what the person's
looking for. But there are

727
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,193
people

728
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:03,262
who I think are kind of natural
connectors and can, can do that

729
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,564
and have a good sense. Um, what
that, what, what you, what

730
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,866
you're

731
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:08,498
looking for.

732
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:11,992
Bekah: Uh, so I have this idea.
I don't know if it's a good

733
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,582
idea,

734
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:18,172
but I keep telling people, so
hopefully it's kind of good. So

735
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:21,233
have you ever been to a, I think
it's called like a Brazilian

736
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,898
barbecue where they have like
those big things of meat and

737
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:24,563
then

738
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:28,222
you have these like chips on the
table and you put up green, if

739
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,455
you want some. Or if you don't
want some me. Right. And so

740
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:32,688
like,

741
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:35,387
what if we take that to the
conference experience? Right.

742
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,932
Because it's always like a
thing. If you're there by

743
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:38,477
yourself,

744
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:41,628
like, who do you eat lunch with?
If you don't know anybody and

745
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:44,777
sometimes people don't want to
talk. Right. They just want to

746
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:50,163
sit there by themselves. So when
we have chips that are green or

747
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:52,893
red, and if you're sitting at a
table and you're open to other

748
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,543
people and talking, then you
have a green chip on your table

749
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:56,193
or a

750
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:58,068
red chip, like I just want to
eat quiet lunch by myself, but I

751
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,943
feel

752
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:05,958
like that reduces a barrier for
people to come in. Um, or my

753
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:07,607
second idea along with that was
like, what if there are topics

754
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:09,167
on

755
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:10,847
tables and then you have a
person kind of like a Virtual

756
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:12,526
Coffee. We

757
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,447
always have a room leader. So
you designate people for that

758
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,367
table.

759
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,788
And like, maybe one table says
like front end developer or

760
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:22,082
another table says like
community and you know that

761
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,346
those people

762
00:38:24,378 --> 00:38:27,407
want to talk about those things
at that table. So then it's like

763
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:31,762
welcoming and you get. A teaser
into what the conversation

764
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,367
already is. And then you can
kind of like, oh, okay. That

765
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,972
seems

766
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:37,882
like it would be a good pet fit.
And that person is safe because

767
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:43,012
their job is to talk to me. So
those are, those are my ideas. I

768
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:44,242
keep telling people about, I
don't know. I still don't know

769
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,472
if

770
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:46,163
they're good, but.

771
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:52,503
Brian: First of all, I love a
Brazilian barbecue. I actually,

772
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:56,072
the first time I went to one was
like, I was still in high school

773
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:57,767
and this was in the nineties,
but it was literally in Brazil.

774
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,252
So.

775
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:05,663
It was called El por cow, which
is like the pig. Um, and you sat

776
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:09,443
at these giant tables, like pig.
They were like huge picnic

777
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:13,012
tables. The place was massive.
And just like the amount of meat

778
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:18,818
coming through there. Crazy.
Anyway, so that's a whole side

779
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:22,743
issue, but yeah. You got me
thinking about that meat. Um,

780
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:26,668
but

781
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:29,053
I think those are great ideas
and actually I've seen similar

782
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:31,168
ideas

783
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,237
done at conferences. I think
it's just not consistent. Like I

784
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,277
I've

785
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:37,858
seen ones where they have like,
you know, you can put, if you

786
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,038
have your, your badge and you
have the little badge, like the

787
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:43,547
flags or whatever, I don't know
what they call them. You can put

788
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:47,353
there someday. I I've seen, I
know I've seen conferences that,

789
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:51,643
that like have kind of, you can
that almost like the green

790
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:55,663
indicator, like, yes. I want to
meet people. Um, I don't I don't

791
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:58,032
know that it's always like
obvious or that people really

792
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,222
participate and that's the hard
part. I like.

793
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:02,032
Bekah: yeah. Or you're like
staring at someone's chest,

794
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,362
trying to figure out, like, do
you have a green thing on your

795
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:05,693
tag?

796
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:10,503
Brian: Yeah. So, and, and even
like, O'Reilly, uh, used to run

797
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:12,212
this conference call, uh,
fluent, which is like a web call

798
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:13,921
in the

799
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:16,563
conference. I mean, it's not the
only conference that did this,

800
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:19,842
but they, they would have at
lunch, they would have. Uh, I

801
00:40:19,842 --> 00:40:21,943
don't remember what they called
them. I was like, maybe it was

802
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:25,092
birds of a feather kind of thing
or something where it's like and

803
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,422
they would usually be like
speaker who had agreed to like

804
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:29,353
sit and be

805
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:29,938
Bekah: I like that.

806
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:33,612
Brian: so that. at least there
was somebody there who was

807
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:34,692
talking about that topic,
because that's the hard part.

808
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:35,772
Like you

809
00:40:35,773 --> 00:40:37,168
can put a topic on the table,
but if nobody's there, I'm not

810
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,563
going

811
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:41,713
to be the first one to say, so
they would have like the speaker

812
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:43,678
go. And usually I know I got
picked for that before, like as

813
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,643
a

814
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,603
speaker and I go grab like a
couple of people so that, you

815
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:52,603
know, it's not even just me,
cause even that can be awkward.

816
00:40:52,603 --> 00:40:54,162
Right. Like you have what looks
like a small group already

817
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:55,721
going.

818
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:59,833
Um, and then, and then you start
those discussions. So I think

819
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,833
those are, so those are great
ideas that like, you know, it's

820
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:07,992
just, um, know, uh, I, I
definitely think could be

821
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:12,313
implemented more consistently as
we get back to in-person events,

822
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:14,222
um, to help.

823
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,232
Bekah: it's interesting because
I think every conference I've

824
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,582
been

825
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,448
to has had some place for
speaker feedback, but I don't

826
00:41:22,448 --> 00:41:25,313
know that

827
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:31,643
there's a conference feedback,
right? Like how did we do as a

828
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:37,402
conference or, you know, what
could we do to create a safer

829
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:42,217
space or a more welcoming space?
And it's hard, you know, I mean,

830
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:44,752
we both know like taking
feedback is a challenge because

831
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,256
you get so

832
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,407
much of it and you have to try
and figure out what to do with

833
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:55,807
it. So, um, I don't know if
there's a, maybe there's some

834
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:59,708
kind of space for doing that
more effectively.

835
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:05,277
Brian: Yeah. that is tough
often. You know, I think even

836
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:08,071
the

837
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:12,873
speaker feedback, like often
times it was like, Hmm, it

838
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,583
wasn't, it wasn't always that
valuable. Usually it was only

839
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,293
the

840
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:18,842
people who, who really just
wanted to complain about

841
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:22,382
something who actually submitted
something or was actually was

842
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:27,032
very, it was either the people
who like just gave to every five

843
00:42:27,032 --> 00:42:29,842
stars across the board. Cause
either. Whatever, and or they

844
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:32,652
are

845
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:35,563
they wanting to complain about
something and, you know, I think

846
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:38,263
the valuable, most valuable
stuff kind of sits in the middle

847
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:40,963
there.

848
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:44,773
It's like, yeah, I enjoyed that.
But here's some ways to improve

849
00:42:44,802 --> 00:42:47,983
like constructive criticism as
opposed to like, yeah. The

850
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:52,118
speaker sucks... for reasons.
Um, So same thing on the

851
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:56,233
conferences.

852
00:42:56,233 --> 00:43:00,222
It's it's, you know, so I've
seen some that do have more of a

853
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:03,342
general, but I don't think
they've asked about what you're

854
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:06,612
looking for, which is like, did
we help you connect with other

855
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:09,282
people if that's what you're
looking for.

856
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:14,793
Bekah: Right. I, the best
feedback I ever got in a talk as

857
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,997
somebody fell asleep. And so
then I knew I needed to do

858
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:19,201
something

859
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:21,452
to take that talk to a different
level.

860
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:28,193
Brian: I don't, I don't recall,
like when I I've seen, I've

861
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:32,693
gotten lots of feedback over the
years, but maybe once or twice

862
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,443
there was something actionable,
but I mean, generally

863
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,381
Bekah: So you just, so you just
wrapped up thejam.dev, right.

864
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:43,395
Um,

865
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:45,181
and I, I made it to the first
day, didn't make it to the

866
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:46,665
second

867
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:51,257
day, but it's really great. And
you do a really good job of, um,

868
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:54,916
you know, like emceeing or
facilitating those conversations

869
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,101
and like bringing the questions
through and asking things,

870
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,286
which,

871
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:59,564
which provides like a really
more of a sense of community,

872
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:01,681
then I

873
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,942
think some of those other online
events that I've seen. So, you

874
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,162
know, what is the thought
process that you have going into

875
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:10,382
that?

876
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,961
And do you organize that all
yourself or do you have support

877
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:18,226
Brian: So, um, so to answer your
second question, first, I

878
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:20,447
partnered with the folks at
FITC, who I've known for a long

879
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,637
time.

880
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:27,436
Um, and that is fantastic. Cause
I mean, I run all the meetups

881
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:29,506
myself, but like, this is a
whole other level where like

882
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,576
now, you

883
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:34,606
know, you have sponsors and all
kinds of stuff and you know, the

884
00:44:34,697 --> 00:44:36,349
video, the quality of the video
feed has to be super and you

885
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,001
have

886
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:39,666
speakers coming in and out
during the, you know, throughout

887
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,331
the

888
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:43,686
day. And. The a lot of the
logistics involved that. Um, so

889
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:46,041
I

890
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:49,371
handle all of like the website
and the, and the, and all of the

891
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:50,976
speakers, like getting all the
speakers and choosing the

892
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:52,581
content

893
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:56,931
and building a schedule and
emceeing obviously. Um, and then

894
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:02,001
they handle like the video and
other like speaker logistics and

895
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:07,161
sponsor logistics and stuff like
that. So like, that is amazing

896
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:12,802
because it's a lot. Um, and I
don't know that. You know, I'm

897
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:15,981
sure I could do it by myself. It
would not be as good an event.

898
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:21,052
Um, and, or as polished and I
think maybe not as great for the

899
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,572
attendees as well. And then he
sets his, so I think the

900
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:29,661
combination works. um, but you
know, in terms of how I think

901
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:32,782
about the event, I mean, I think
you're right. Like, I try to

902
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:38,166
think about what makes virtual.
Better in ways that then, then,

903
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:42,577
you know, not better. Okay. I
love in-person events, but like

904
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,867
what, what things are virtual
events better at? And, and so,

905
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,847
like, I can't stand virtual
events that are like, I call

906
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:50,827
them

907
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:52,407
glorified YouTube playlists.

908
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:53,317
Bekah: Yeah.

909
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:56,101
Brian: It's like, if I could go
to your YouTube, play to a

910
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:57,781
YouTube playlist and get the
same basic effect, because it

911
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,461
goes

912
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:01,366
from recorded session to
recorded session. And like, you

913
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:03,271
know,

914
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:06,121
other than adding that little
chat or something like that. And

915
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:07,831
it's like, that's, that's not
an, that's not an event to me.

916
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,541
the

917
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,101
event has to be like, has to be
about the community that's

918
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,661
there.

919
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:14,281
Right? Like it's about the
people that's there, there. So,

920
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,870
you

921
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:21,117
know, um, I think. Those live.
Even when we have recorded

922
00:46:21,117 --> 00:46:23,292
sessions, they always have,
like, we have a significant

923
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,467
amount of

924
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:28,451
time dedicated to that live Q
and A. Um, so like we have like

925
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:31,435
was

926
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:35,967
30 minute presentation and then
15 minutes of live Q and A. It

927
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:39,047
gives everybody an opportunity
to their questions and get them

928
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:40,711
answered by the speaker, which
is kind of the critical piece to

929
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,375
me,

930
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:47,117
because I could watch your video
on YouTube, but I can't directly

931
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:49,036
ask you questions. Right. Um,
and get those questions

932
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:50,955
answered. So.

933
00:46:52,336 --> 00:46:57,257
So that that part I think is, is
great. Um, we try and throw in

934
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:00,106
like, you know, we try and bring
in speakers from all over the

935
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,561
place, which I think is great,
which would be difficult. I

936
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,016
mean,

937
00:47:03,016 --> 00:47:05,371
we had speakers from, um, you
know, every, almost every part

938
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,726
of

939
00:47:07,726 --> 00:47:12,376
the world. Yesterday, uh, you
know, we had attendees from

940
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:18,137
almost everywhere. Um, so, those
are things that, that, can be

941
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:22,427
great at. Um, it was free, which
is, been, I've been pushing to

942
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:25,666
kind of make these free because
there's a lot of costs involved,

943
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:27,497
like I think, you know, I
finally was able to win over and

944
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:29,297
make

945
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:32,079
this free, which to me makes,
opens it up to everybody. Um,

946
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,861
So,

947
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:36,856
I mean, those are the things,
um, that the me are important to

948
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:38,821
make

949
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:43,141
it, not just like, I want to
make it fun. I try to keep them

950
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:46,052
somewhat lighthearted, which is
why, like, all my events have

951
00:47:46,052 --> 00:47:48,822
like weird names and stuff like
that. Like, like the moar

952
00:47:48,871 --> 00:47:50,971
serverless or jammed dot dev I
ha I go off with the themes.

953
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:53,071
Like

954
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:59,452
this was a kind of eighties rock
band theme. last year was.

955
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:02,942
Wasn't, it was also like
eighties, nineties, hip hop

956
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:08,101
themes. So, you know, it's like
it has, I just try to keep the

957
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:13,501
stuff lighthearted and fun and,
know, um, and hopefully people

958
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:17,552
enjoy it. it seemed like people
did. So I'm happy about that.

959
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:23,442
Bekah: That's awesome. Um, we're
at about time here, but is there

960
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,346
anything else that you'd like to
anything that's coming up for

961
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:27,250
you

962
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:31,211
that you want to share or any
last bits of advice for other

963
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,871
people maybe working on
communities right now?

964
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:41,552
Brian: Um, you know, I I'd say
I'd love for people to join

965
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:46,681
cfe.dev, We obviously we run
after the afternoon crowd, uh,

966
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:47,012
Bekah: Thank you.

967
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:48,766
Brian: Virtual Coffee. So you
can go to Virtual Coffee and

968
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:50,520
then

969
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:52,456
come join a session. Um, I'd
love for people to join that. We

970
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,391
have

971
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:57,316

00:48:57,316 --> 00:49:00,241
1:00 PM

973
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,461
eastern is when we run those.
Um, and then trying to expand to

974
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,651
do

975
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:09,197
