00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,019
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season six, episode two of the

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,574
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:15,129
that

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,789
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,334
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,879
their

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,789
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,304
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

9
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,819
share it with

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,359
you here with me. Today is my
co-host Dan.

11
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,299
Dan: Hello! How's it going,
Rebecca?

12
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:36,994
Bekah: It is going fabulous.

13
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,465
Dan: That's so much less
satisfying to say than "wuddup

14
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,664
Bek." I think I'm just gonna
start saying that every

15
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,884
Bekah: fine. It's fine. That's
cool.

16
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:49,314
Dan: anyway, uh, yes. Today we
have another, um, you know,

17
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,984
awesome. Obviously, uh, guest,
uh, Bogdan.

18
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:54,325
Bekah: theme for six is
awesomeness.

19
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:59,185
Dan: Yes. And really all of our
honest. Uh, but yeah, we have

20
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:03,354
Bogdan Covrig here. Uh, he is a
software developer from the

21
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,874
Netherlands and, um, he, I don't
know. Yeah, he, he, it was

22
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,394
really

23
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,754
great having mind, he, he just
finished school, um, like last

24
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,754
year, sometime, right. Or this
year, last year, I don't know,

25
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:15,265
recently

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,319
Bekah: time has not exist over
the

27
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:21,715
Dan: right? Yeah. Yeah, no, I
have no idea. Um, but he talks

28
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,424
about that. He talks about
experience in school and going

29
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:25,239
through school and, um, and
then, you know, his experiences.

30
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,054
As

31
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:29,905
developer and, uh, it was really
fun. It's really good talking

32
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,105
Bekah: It's always interesting
to think about the journeys that

33
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:38,694
people take to get them to the
roles that they're in. And so I

34
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:42,295
think Bogdan is one of the first
people, or one of the few people

35
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:44,717
that we've talked to. Who's
been. An educator, as in like in

36
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,139
a

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,060
university setting, teaching
people about coding and to hear

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,535
what that was like and what he
learned from that experience

39
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:57,010
that

40
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,760
brought him to

41
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:01,509
Dan: Yeah, totally. I mean, I
was very curious to hear about

42
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:02,514
that

43
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:07,135
and I did some computer science
in, in, in school and in college

44
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:11,425
and it was a long time ago. Uh,
and I don't know, I was curious

45
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:14,275
to hear about, I'm also just
curious to hear about what it's

46
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,830
like in a classroom right now.
Um, a developer, as you know, in

47
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,159
a college classroom, as opposed
to bootcamps and things like

48
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,349
that. And, um, yeah. And, and
also, I don't know the idea of

49
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,870
teaching is just like, so beyond
anything I've ever done, like,

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,479
you know, teaching at semesters
of worth of classes, you know,

51
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,560
um, although I was curious about
it and so it was really nice to

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,159
hear about it from, from, from
Bogdan.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,240
Bekah: And to hear the process
that he went through as he was

54
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,919
trying to figure out like what's
next for him in his career path.

55
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,639
And we start every episode of
this podcast. Like we start

56
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,709
every

57
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,800
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

58
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,180
we're from, what we do and a
random check in question. So we

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,067
hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random. Check-in

60
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:09,954
question

61
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:15,955
is what is your favorite
condiment? My name is Bekah. I'm

62
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:20,846
a technical community builder,
and my favorite condiment is hot

63
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,885
sauce. Definitely. That goes on
everything.

64
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,945
Dan: That's a good one. Yeah.
All right. Hi, I'm Dan. I do web

65
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:33,586
development in Cleveland. I, um,
I don't have a super favorite.

66
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:39,836
Uh, I'd say so there's this taco
place in, um, near where I live

67
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:44,366
called, uh, what's it called
Bombas. And they, so when you

68
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:47,786
can, they have this like sauce
and you can, when you order like

69
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:50,545
a taco box to go, you know, like
this, like a family box or

70
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,075
whatever, they'll give you just
like a whole, like a whole.

71
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,605
Thing

72
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,125
of it, a whole like bottle of
it. And, um, I, when we do that,

73
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,645
I, I

74
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,025
use it for like the next two
weeks on like everything. So I,

75
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,405
I

76
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,518
can't really describe it. I
think it has garlic in it.

77
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,625
Certainly. I

78
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,566
don't, it may be some sort of
aioli maybe. Uh, I, I don't

79
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,725
actually know and I don't
really,

80
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:09,596
Bekah: No, it's not

81
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,508
Dan: no, it's not, it's not
spicy. You. It's a little

82
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,300
creamy,

83
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,380
I guess, although saying creamy
makes it sound weird. I dunno,

84
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,440
but, uh, but it's good. And
like, I don't wanna know really.

85
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,789
I like

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,990
the mystery of it, you know what
I mean? It's just like thing

87
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,190
that

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,800
shows up and then it goes away
and then a couple months later

89
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,092
we'll order, you know, those
tacos again, and it'll be back

90
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,379
to

91
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:32,531
my life. Uh, I don't wanna have
the, my, like, maybe it's just

92
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,471
some junky thing that they buy
off. The, it probably is

93
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,690
something that I could just buy
at the grocery store, you know,

94
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,680
but I don't wanna know

95
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,485
Bekah: it like Manasi

96
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,240
Dan: don't know it's.

97
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,185
Bekah: refrigerated?

98
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,090
Dan: I mean, I put it in the
refrigerator. I don't, I assume

99
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,349
I

100
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,345
don't, I don't, I don't know.
Why would you have an open

101
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,340
bottle of

102
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,290
some sort of sauce that you
didn't put in the refrigerator?

103
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,615
Bekah: Hot sauce. Doesn't go in
the refrigerator.

104
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,040
Dan: It doesn't. We keep our

105
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,286
Bogdan: some do I feel like

106
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,290
Dan: Yeah. I don't know. Well,
like Tabasco, do you Tabasco in

107
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,471
the

108
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:06,915
Bekah: think it needs to a lot
of vinegar in it and that

109
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:07,360
Dan: uh,

110
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:07,735
Bekah: need to be

111
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,460
Dan: had these refrigerator
talks before. I, I don't know

112
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,555
the

113
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,685
rules, so I just assume
everything goes in because it

114
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:13,646
seems safer to me,

115
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:15,415
Bekah: in the refrigerator. They

116
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,045
Dan: This is what I'm saying. I
don't, I don't. I, uh, and I, I

117
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,073
don't have the knowledge to
argue with you about it. I just

118
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,096
put

119
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,346
things in the fridge because
that always seems like the safer

120
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,026
option. You know what I mean? To
me?

121
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,831
Bogdan: do not. You put, do you
put your oil in the fridge?

122
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:27,805
Dan: Uh, no,

123
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,391
Bogdan: Yeah,

124
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,845
Dan: no. All right. Yeah, that
that'd be weird. I actually had

125
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,044
a

126
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:33,265
friend, um, uh, Emily Emily's
brother actually, uh, like got

127
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,485
in

128
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,386
the habit of keeping his cereal,
like in the fridge. Because he

129
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,956
said it kept it, like it would
not go stale as fast, you know,

130
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:47,665
it would stay fresh longer. Uh,
don't know. I mean, he is just

131
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,390
like living alone, you know, and
I don't know, but like we went

132
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,115
on

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,617
vacation together at this little
cottage with this tiny fridge

134
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:54,114
and

135
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,975
the whole fridge was full of
cereal. We were like, no, this

136
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,835
is

137
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:01,225
not like, this is not a, this is
not, we're putting this in the

138
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:05,170
cabinet. So that's where I draw
the line. Uh, cereal. It

139
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:06,326
Bekah: That's

140
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,151
Dan: in the fridge.

141
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:09,415
Bekah: I'm glad you draw the

142
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,281
Dan: Oil. Yeah. Yeah, no, I, I
knew, I know enough not to put

143
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:16,091
oil the fridge. Um, other than
that, I'll put things in the

144
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,396
fridge and then sometimes Emily
will say, Hey, that doesn't go

145
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:18,701
in

146
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:22,540
the fridge dummy and I'm like,
okay, fair enough. But this

147
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,725
sauce, I don't wanna know
whether it does or not. You know

148
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:24,910
what I

149
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,620
mean? Cause I don't wanna know
anything about it. That's my

150
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,180
point. So I'm just putting it in
the

151
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,935
Bekah: know about it. That's

152
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,711
Dan: right? It's a mystery. No,
I like it. Like it tastes very

153
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:37,000
good. I feel like if I learn
about. Something will it'll

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,680
become less good.

155
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,124
Bogdan: Or be disgusted by it.

156
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,538
Dan: That is, that is a very
serious, uh, that, I mean, that

157
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:47,459
is an actual possibility too. I
don't, I don't want that

158
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:48,838
Bekah: injuries. Dan

159
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,588
Bogdan: Okay. Hello. Uh,
everybody. I am Bodan I'm from

160
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,793
Romania, but I am a software
engineer in the Netherlands.

161
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,998
I've

162
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,869
been living here for almost five
years, moved from a tiny city in

163
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:07,738
Romania to a tiny city in the
Netherlands. Um, and I like it

164
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,053
and I don't wanna leave. Um, and
I think I were talking about

165
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,084
sauces sauce or condiments.

166
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,848
Bekah: Well, I consider some
sauce as a condiment,

167
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:21,238
Bogdan: Okay.

168
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,139
Dan: Well, like,

169
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,399
Bogdan: No, no, no. Yeah, I get
it.

170
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:25,439
Bekah: yeah. Pasta

171
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,728
Bogdan: No, no, no, I get it. I
was just, Cause one of the best

172
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,119
thing that I discovered and
absolutely changed my life, my

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,601
friends got me like this, um,
jar of. Chipotle pepper or

174
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,083
whatever.

175
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,053
I don't know how it works. I
don't know how, but it's just

176
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,103
amazing. Cuz then I put it in
absolutely everything. I mean,

177
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,533
not everything, every like
everything that goes with like

178
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,468
tomato sauce or tomatoes, I
just, for some of those and it's

179
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,403
just

180
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:55,004
amazing, like the smokey
everything. So yeah. But

181
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:57,524
otherwise it's got like, usually
it's got like garlic goes into

182
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,653
everything, uh, and.

183
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,033
Dan: mean garlic's delicious.
Yeah.

184
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:03,793
Bogdan: Yeah. And smoked public
also, like if there's something

185
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,514
that needs to be, I don't know,
smoked stuff, it's amazing. and

186
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,593
garlic as well. So yeah.

187
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,913
Dan: like it. I almost said, I
almost said.

188
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,913
Bogdan: I think, yeah, but I
have, I mean, I have to agree,

189
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:23,533
like with dance friend, like
living alone, like it just.

190
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,414
There's there are no rules. I,
you know, I do what I want. I

191
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,559
put

192
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:30,016
everything where I want. And
also I'm the only one that needs

193
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,468
to

194
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:32,999
know where it's placed. So,

195
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:33,344
Bekah: together

196
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:33,989
Bogdan: yeah, I

197
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:39,014
Bekah: you put your Chipotle
condiment in the refrigerator?

198
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,548
Bogdan: I do, but I'm not sure
if I have to, I don't think it's

199
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,843
forbidden. Right. but I just, I,
I, I just, it keeps me sane cuz

200
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,138
I

201
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,494
had to, I had a tiny Tabasco,
um, bottles, but like I feel

202
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,849
like the

203
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,234
vinegar goes up and then I try
to shake it and it doesn't and

204
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,619
then

205
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,223
it's all vinegar and I don't
like it. So I keep it in the

206
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,827
fridge.

207
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:05,428
It's just to be sure, but I
don't

208
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,509
Bekah: try that experiment.

209
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:11,144
Bogdan: I dunno, but no tomatoes
don't go into fridge. Like I'm,

210
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,173
it's just nuts. It's the way it
is my friends.

211
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,589
Bekah: Yes, no 100% agree with
you.

212
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:17,984
Bogdan: Yeah.

213
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,198
Bekah: Well, thanks for being
with us here today, Bogdan, and

214
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,839
we like to start every podcast
episode with your origin story.

215
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,198
So talk to us a little bit about
how you got into tech.

216
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,533
Bogdan: Um, okay. Thank you for
having me. I just, I, I mean, I

217
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:38,033
wanna just start. With like, I
think it's very unfair. How

218
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,363
clear

219
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:46,364
Dan sounds compared to the two
of us Bekah do you don't post it

220
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:50,173
like this? You don't sound that
cool. The actual, like there's

221
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,874
some mixing going on, right?

222
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,808
Dan: wait, are you saying,

223
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:55,964
Bogdan: you sound very cool

224
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:56,818
Dan: oh,

225
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,624
Bogdan: and I don't, I, I don't
know, but I'm looking at those

226
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:02,864
things moving on the screen and
he, yours are bigger.

227
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,964
Dan: Um, well, okay, well, I
might just be talking louder or

228
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,933
having my, it might be too, too
loud, actually. I wasn't really

229
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,303
looking at it until just now.
is, uh,

230
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,019
Bekah: on different screens too.

231
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:16,754
Dan: that's probably true

232
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,149
Bekah: looks very tiny, like
barely.

233
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:23,548
Dan: Yeah, yours probably
honestly like I mean, and I try

234
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,318
to do this, like I fix this up
in editing later, I try to,

235
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,088
right.

236
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,159
So this is like sound
engineering stuff that I've been

237
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,839
learning on

238
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:33,658
the fly since we were started
working on the podcast. So I

239
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,658
don't, you know, I don't know a
lot about it, but like the, uh,

240
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,589
trying to get those levels, you
know, to where it's close to the

241
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,219
edges is usually the best. Uh,
so Bekah is like, I, yeah, like,

242
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,668
like was saying. You're a little
quiet still, you know,

243
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:48,839
Bekah: I'm

244
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,808
Dan: uh, a little bit, not a
lot. Uh,

245
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,558
Bekah: You didn't tell me to.

246
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,838
Dan: well, I didn't really
notice before and also in, so

247
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,728
for those,

248
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,499
I don't know if we're gonna cut
this or not, but for people

249
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,463
listening, we Zencaster, and it
doesn't show you these nice

250
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,427
level

251
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,448
outputs until you're recording,
uh, which is really obnoxious.

252
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:13,124
Um, it's hard to tell. Um, so. I
don't know. But Bogdan, do you

253
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:16,813
have, is that the wave? Is that
the wave one? Wave three.

254
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,499
Bogdan: You are wave tree, but
no, it was a compliment. We

255
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:21,134
don't

256
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:22,844
have to go into it. also very,

257
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:26,354
Dan: I, I got, I just got the
wave three, like last

258
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,313
Bogdan: I have, yeah.

259
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,624
Dan: a day getting it set up so
I can send you some stuff.

260
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:33,583
Bogdan: it's no it's wave three,
right? It is. Yeah. It's wave

261
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,683
three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like
it. It's

262
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,243
Dan: got, I got, I like it too.
I just got it. Yeah, two weeks

263
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,653
ago

264
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:39,703
or a week and a half ago. So,

265
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:44,653
Bogdan: Yeah, but is your room
like prepared for this cuz your

266
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,524
insanely good? Like there's no
way mine sounds like this. Yeah.

267
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:52,543
Dan: yours sounds good. I think
one thing is you probably could

268
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:56,114
be closer to your mic. Uh that's
I mean, maybe not, I don't know

269
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,663
when you're it's when you're
moving away. So like, if I sit

270
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,933
back here, does that sound, that
sounds like noticeably worse,

271
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:02,354
more

272
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:07,349
Bekah: So, so for the listeners,
Dan has scooted his back about

273
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:08,099
four feet.

274
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:13,453
Dan: so that was the one thing,
uh, I, uh, I read about, uh, uh,

275
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,984
so they do like, do like the
hang 10, like this, you know,

276
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,484
or, or

277
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,484
whatever. And then that's like
distance from your mouth to the

278
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,813
that it should be. Right. And
that's, that's hard. Yeah. It's

279
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:26,293
hard. Not to, it's hard not to
move. Um, but like that gets you

280
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,448
picked up more, but then there's
a bunch of other stuff too, so

281
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,603
we

282
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:29,773
don't have to get into it on
that. Maybe we do a whole

283
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:30,942
episode

284
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:31,543
on it sometime

285
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,109
Bogdan: okay. Sorry. I'm

286
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,063
Bekah: Maybe, maybe a live
stream and then the visual

287
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,759
Bogdan: Yeah, ishish share the
screen.

288
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,083
Dan: okay. Anyway, um, I don't
know what you were saying, but

289
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,793
you were talking Yes. Okay.
Thank

290
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,189
Bogdan: talking about origin
story. Well, yeah. Uh, yeah,

291
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,509
it's

292
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,711
very, it's very linear and.
Rather boring, but, uh, yeah,

293
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:57,913
cuz

294
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,773
I did so in Romania we have high
schools that are very

295
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,633
specialized

296
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,114
and I did one of those with
computer science. So I kind of

297
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:10,063
knew I wanted, I, I have, my
family is mainly like musicians.

298
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,854
A lot of them are trained
musicians, so I didn't wanna do

299
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:17,714
that cuz I thought it's boring
and fired back to me a few years

300
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,024
later, but yeah, I thought it's
boring. So I went straight to

301
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,259
like this mathematics computer.
High school. So I, I kind of

302
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,494
knew

303
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,814
I wanted to do this. I kind of
hated it at the time as well.

304
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,134
You

305
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,918
know, the whole CC plus plus
things that don't make any

306
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,702
sense,

307
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:34,244
uh, when you're young and you
just wanna make what's the

308
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,004
rectangle move on the screen.
Right. I don't wanna spend my

309
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,773
yeah. Anyways, but yeah, I
graduated at, and then I moved

310
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,542
to

311
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,514
the Netherlands to do applied
computer science, which was

312
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:48,403
another surprise cuz uh, it was
this program of like computer

313
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,344
science of course, but.
Electrical engineering as well,

314
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:55,663
which look, I could have look it
up and I did look it up. Like I

315
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,453
kind of knew what program was.
Right. But I did. I wasn't sure

316
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,524
if there's gonna be a lot of, I
didn't even know what's

317
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,504
electrical engineering and
turned out to be like very not

318
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:04,484
cool.

319
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,093
like not toward the field
itself. This is just for me,

320
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,922
like in

321
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:12,688
university years. It was, I was
like, yeah, still I wanna make

322
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,038
rectangles move. But then I got
super, super, super lucky in my

323
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:21,208
first year of university. I
think, uh, I got a job remote

324
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,143
Jobi Romania for like one of my
friends father that had this

325
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,078
like

326
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,188
eCommerce kind of low key
business, uh, where I got into

327
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,038
node. Um, I did not lie on my
interview, but something made

328
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,888
him

329
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,879
think. I actually, no note I, I
did, I did know about note,

330
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,469
right? I was like,

331
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:40,889
Dan: heard

332
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,494
Bogdan: Yeah. Cuz I did. So I
like, I remember, so the very

333
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:50,384
first thing I did, like web was,
uh, back in high school was like

334
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,953
despite P five GS, which is
still around, they're very much

335
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:59,264
happening, but there was this,
uh, people doing this coding

336
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,973
train there were super into it.
And I did like, they did like

337
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,653
the

338
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,533
snake and I did the snake and
then I wanted to do, uh, like.

339
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,003
Like a multiplayer thing or like
a chat room for it. Uh, and I,

340
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:11,183
I,

341
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:15,734
I knew that you can use notes to
do that and that was the only

342
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:19,423
information I had. And I was
like, yeah, you can do like web

343
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,946
sockets, right? Yeah. But
anyways, they were, they were,

344
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:25,844
they were very nice to me and
like, they actually hired, and I

345
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,181
learned a lot about like
databases and mode and stuff

346
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:28,513
like

347
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:30,733
that. And then the second year
of university came in when. I

348
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,952
was

349
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,023
actually teaching more
programming and I finally kind

350
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,672
of

351
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,344
overlapped the two and be like,
oh, okay, I'm doing this for my

352
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:40,859
job. I'm learning about this.
You know, even in school we

353
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,374
learned

354
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,278
bit like about testing and C CD
and things like that. I was

355
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,153
like,

356
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:51,524
oh, this is actually cool and
useful. So I, yeah. Tried to

357
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:56,714
finish school. Uh, continued.
Then I got a university job like

358
00:15:56,714 --> 00:16:00,786
teaching, uh, Java, which. Which
was bad. look, I have this

359
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:04,858
theory

360
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:09,058
and I hope I never have to, to
get a teaching job again. Cuz if

361
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,528
I say this, no, I don't. No,
it's not. No, it's not. It's not

362
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:11,998
a hot

363
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:15,149
day, but it's just like teaching
programming. It's so easy. Cuz

364
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:19,798
you just like. You just say,
like, I I'm, I'm, I'm gonna show

365
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:22,229
you how to Google and if they
have questions, you just Google

366
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,828
in front of them and I, and, and
find out things together, which

367
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,508
is nice, you know, they also
need to know how to Google. Um,

368
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,188
but

369
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:30,781
yeah, and then I got an
internship at another

370
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,369
university,

371
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:37,798
uh, but for research and then I
moved here to another city, um,

372
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:42,543
while still studying, uh, I did
my internship. I got a full

373
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,413
contract after, but Corona
happened. So I was staying here

374
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:52,354
working full time while, um,
finishing my, my bachelor basic

375
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:59,024
or barely like trying to finish
my, my bachelor. and then I, I,

376
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,803
the, the master university
research position was absolutely

377
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:06,554
amazing. Like it's, it was
academia, which was kind of new

378
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,978
to me, cuz I, I always knew I
wanna be in a developer right.

379
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,402
Or

380
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,008
an engineer, but I was like,
okay, we can combine this.

381
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,613
Right.

382
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't know a lot about
research, but I know about

383
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,554
development so we can definitely
overlap cuz it was also like a

384
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:25,499
legal kind of legal tech, um,
Space where they had a lot of

385
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:29,669
data where they had a lot of
ideas about tech, but they did

386
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,759
the developers. So yeah, we kind
of combined it very nice, but

387
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,668
things slowly came to an end.
And finally, two months ago I

388
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,518
got a

389
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,398
new software engineering job,
uh, to a digital creative

390
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:44,037
internet,

391
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,798
whatever they call it agency,
uh, in net lens. So I plan to,

392
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,468
to.

393
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:54,344
Doing node, basically node react
type script, uh, things like

394
00:17:54,344 --> 00:18:00,973
that. So, yeah, I think that's,
that's it. This is today. just

395
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,433
recently joined a yeah.

396
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,209
Bekah: You recently joined. I'm
sorry. I cut you off.

397
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:09,163
Bogdan: Yeah, no, that was it
just recently two months ago. I

398
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,368
think it was April, so yeah. Um,

399
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,003
Bekah: So I wanna back up a
little bit and ask some

400
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,428
questions

401
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,544
about the schooling that you've
done. So it sounds like there

402
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,659
was

403
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:22,888
maybe more practical application
than I've seen from universities

404
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:26,219
in the United States, which
computer science degrees have a

405
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:31,558
lot of, um, like theoretical
content algorithms and that kind

406
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,429
of stuff. Is that, is that
accurate statement or were you

407
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,269
doing a lot of that stuff?

408
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:42,209
Bogdan: yeah, we were doing that
for sure as. But yeah, with an

409
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:46,078
eye on electrical engineering
and kind of like, so in the

410
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,623
Netherlands, they have this
system of like universities,

411
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,168
what

412
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,098
they call universities, research
universities, which is basically

413
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,028
like a college university in us
as well. Right. Where they, you

414
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,756
know, they teach, you know, like
normal university and they,

415
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,478
these

416
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:07,078
things, um, just. What they call
Hogge schools or like S where,

417
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,979
where like more professional
schools, uh, in English, they

418
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,719
call them universities of
applied sciences, but it's in,

419
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,459
in, in

420
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:18,959
Dutch, doesn't really go. It's
not really, I think it, I, I

421
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,055
think it's the university, but
like, yeah, there's a

422
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,147
difference.

423
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:25,858
You like more of a, like a very,
like a very engineering. I kind

424
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:27,876
of applied. Hands on experience.
It's also longer, it's four

425
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,894
years

426
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,244
instead of three. And you have
to do internships. You have to

427
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,594
work

428
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,814
with companies, you have to work
with clients and things like

429
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,574
that, uh, which is for people
that wanna do, you know, wanna

430
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:38,998
get straight to, to work and
things like that, which goes

431
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,422
very

432
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,374
well for like engineering and
things like that.

433
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:44,114
Bekah: yeah.

434
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,233
Bogdan: So it was one of those,
you know, where you, where you

435
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:53,173
have like more like programming,
but like kind of rather like the

436
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,413
applied part was like more the
electrical part rather than web,

437
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,943
right? Like we didn't, we didn't
learn about web development, but

438
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:05,054
we did learn about operating
systems or micro or things that

439
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:11,923
go into electrical engineering
field. I think I did not.

440
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:16,453
Fortunately, no, but we, we, it
was, it was insane. Like I

441
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:19,138
absolutely, it, it, it was
insane and we did micro controls

442
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,823
of

443
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,571
course, and all that, like,
Cheap programming and things

444
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:25,318
like that,

445
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:29,848
which I absolutely dreaded and I
couldn't wait to be over. Uh,

446
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:31,273
although it was interesting,
right? Like operating systems

447
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,698
was

448
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:36,868
such an interesting thing, but
it's just like the, the, the,

449
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,704
the, the whole thing of like
patterns and ideas and things

450
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,939
you

451
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,549
can have in web development.
You, I couldn't have in.

452
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,159
Operating

453
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,929
systems, you know, you, you
can't get too creative about

454
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,699
Cause

455
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,153
there are, especially in
microcontrollers, like they,

456
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,607
they

457
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:57,929
have this, these huge books and
guides about, about them and you

458
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,898
have to know things and you have
to look for things that are just

459
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:05,009
set. Right. Or I don't know
enough to, to make this

460
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,159
conclusion, but it's still like
the way I saw it was like, this

461
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,898
is, I can't, I can't be creative
here, you know? Um, but I

462
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,778
finished it anyways, but yeah,
Yeah.

463
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:17,504
Dan: no, I, I love that. I love
hearing about that. Uh, you

464
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,614
know,

465
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:22,003
and you have used this phrase a.
To when you're telling the story

466
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:25,663
about, uh, like I didn't get to
move around boxes or, you know,

467
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,223
move around boxes. And like, I,
I like it's, I know that's like

468
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:28,783
a

469
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:29,954
funny way of saying it, but I, I
totally connect with that

470
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,124
because

471
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,784
that's, that's something that I,
uh, personally, like, I don't

472
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:37,003
think, I mean, I, I never put it
exactly like that, but it's the

473
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,893
same thing of that. Um, the
thing that drew me to

474
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,783
programming was

475
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,913
the, was that was moving around
boxes or like doing a thing,

476
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:45,012
like

477
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,949
doing a thing and then getting
to see it like move or happen

478
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:48,584
or.

479
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,814
Just see it in front of me.
Right. And, uh, and while like

480
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:55,483
academically, some of the more
like the operating, the lower

481
00:21:55,483 --> 00:22:00,084
level stuff is, you know,
interesting. Maybe, you know, I,

482
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,679
I totally lost my connection to
all of it. Like I, I like, and

483
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,044
I,

484
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,653
like I said this before, that's
when I switched majors out of

485
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,588
computer sciences, I was deep
into that, that like section,

486
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,523
you

487
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,294
know what I mean, as doing
assembly and I was doing, I

488
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:13,258
wasn't, uh, I don't know. I
don't think I was that semester

489
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,222
had

490
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,668
even done where I got to. Hit
save or compile and see

491
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,113
something

492
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,503
happen. You know what I mean?
And, and it was just like, uh,

493
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,128
and I lost my interest, you
know? Um, and I think the, it

494
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,753
seems

495
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,104
like you have acknowledged that
in, you know, yourself and use

496
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,953
that as maybe whether it was
consciously or not use that as

497
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,773
like a sort of driving force and
in finding, you know, your path,

498
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,678
uh, and, and like your
happiness, like you could.

499
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,433
Possibly. And

500
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,163
maybe some people I guess, could
have forced themselves down the

501
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,893
line of, you know, the
electrical engineering and

502
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:50,623
gotten a job. I

503
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,619
don't know, soldering things or
something. I dunno. But, but,

504
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,614
uh,

505
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:58,064
but you know, but like you, I
don't know, it's, I, I just

506
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,104
connect with that. I just wanted
to like, kind of highlight that

507
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,265
because it's, it, it finding
what makes you happy in a, in a

508
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,422
field

509
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,794
is, is important. Especially
field like computer science,

510
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:11,023
because there are gonna be some
people that will. Get into those

511
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,874
micro controllers and be totally
hooked, you know, and

512
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:14,519
Bogdan: Of

513
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,173
Dan: some people, some people
not, you know, and right. Yeah.

514
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,804
Uh, no, so I, I think that's
great.

515
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,638
Bogdan: Yeah, no for sure. I
mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

516
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,999
Yeah. It's just like, also, like
I remember since I was younger

517
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,768
from high school, like people
had a thing for Arduinos, which

518
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,537
I

519
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,469
think that I, I think that, I
think that's what I think that's

520
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:35,923
why I thought it's gonna be
cool. Cuz like everybody was

521
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:37,377
like, oh

522
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:39,133
my God. Artino like we have to
do this and things like that.

523
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,888
And

524
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,699
I'm like, I do. Okay. I, I loved
it. Right. I think it's cool.

525
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,013
Like raspberry pies and things
like that. It's fun. But yeah,

526
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:49,327
I,

527
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:52,058
yeah, I think I, yeah, like
there, what I agree with you,

528
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,568
like, I need to see immediate
change and I, I need a reaction

529
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,888
from things I'm doing. Cause
otherwise I feel like I spend

530
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:58,208
the

531
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:02,169
whole day doing nothing. That's
not super productive.

532
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:06,063
Bekah: So when you were doing
the research part of things, was

533
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,778
that

534
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:14,028
more data sciencey or what were
you doing there?

535
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:19,348
Bogdan: Yeah, kind of, yeah, we
had a lot of, yeah, there was,

536
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:24,088
there was data science part, um,
and again, diving in with little

537
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:27,269
data science knowledge, cuz I
didn't, yeah, I didn't study

538
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:32,499
that. I had ideas. I. I knew
Python for example, but I got, I

539
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:37,999
got very, I got, I got get very
lucky to, to find this amazing

540
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,699
person that really, really took
care of everything. Like my

541
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,459
mentor and one of. Manager
bosses, whatever, the person

542
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,219
that

543
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,898
I actually got a job through.
And she was super amazing and

544
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,577
she

545
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,558
found all these cool
opportunities and all these

546
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,578
relations and connections and
papers we wrote and projects we

547
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:58,798
got in. So I had the time to, to
learn it on, on the way, right.

548
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,388
Like I didn't have to worry
like, oh, what am I gonna do

549
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:01,978
now? I'm

550
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,418
always just like, I knew what I
have to do, but I also knew

551
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,857
what,

552
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,341
what I have to learn. So there
was amazing. Um, but then we

553
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,644
also

554
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:13,064
did APIs for example, which was
my previous job as well. And I

555
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:18,179
think this is one of the things
that. Kind of help them make the

556
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,209
decision to hire me cuz uh, they
were working already on these

557
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,143
APIs. Uh, but again, related
data like they had, we had a lot

558
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,077
of

559
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:28,169
data. We needed to serve it to
different sources, to different

560
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:31,739
other universities, for example,
create some user interfaces and

561
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:37,169
stuff like that. So we created
this APIs, uh, for them, um,

562
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:40,199
which was more engineering, but
then yeah, data science part, we

563
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,969
did a lot of machine learning
and analysis and NLP for the

564
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:43,739
papers

565
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:49,259
we were, we were writing. It's
very different and definitely

566
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,078
some something that I really
enjoy doing, but I, I knew it

567
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,219
the, the whole, the whole way.
And it was almost three years.

568
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:59,368
Right. I knew the whole time I
don't wanna do that. I really

569
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:00,856
much enjoyed it. And I really
much loved working with all

570
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:02,338
these

571
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,909
people, but I, I knew for sure,
it's, it's not something I'm

572
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:09,929
gonna spend my, you know, my
next, whatever years doing.

573
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:14,743
Bekah: was there, was there like
a moment that you realized that,

574
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:19,094
or it was just kind of like, I
can do this, but I'm. Super

575
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:19,933
interested in it.

576
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:24,763
Bogdan: Yeah, well, I kind of
learned on the job, right. So I

577
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:28,064
didn't have a moment to actually
reflect, but it was keep on

578
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:33,314
coming, keep on coming. Um, I am
talking about moving rectangles

579
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,923
again. This is very serious, so
don't, don't take it too

580
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:40,753
seriously, but it is, uh, and
it's not seriously, but I so.

581
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,224
Look, I like, I like things to,
to, to look good. It's, it's

582
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:47,239
very

583
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,058
silly, but I like the tools that
I used to look very good.

584
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,818
Notebooks are not via code and
things like that. But the whole

585
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:59,778
concept of like staring the
whole, those notebooks was

586
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,773
something, it was something
weird for me. I was like, it's

587
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:03,768
not

588
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,374
supposed to be like that. I
don't know if you ever worked

589
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,979
with data

590
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:11,548
or with people. Are doing data
stuff, but those notebooks are

591
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,269
getting extremely messy. I don't
know if it's for everybody or it

592
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:19,588
was just for us, it was insanely
messy. Like there's, there's,

593
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,378
there was impossible to like
pick up a notebook. I wrote, you

594
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:24,327
know,

595
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:26,878
three weeks ago and I still
understand it. Like it was

596
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,489
insane. So I was like, I don't
know for how long I can like

597
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:36,223
guessing my, you know, my, my
thoughts you know, So of course,

598
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:39,463
I mean, there's, there are ways
to do it better. It's not like I

599
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:43,723
tried everything. It was just
like the comfort of like working

600
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,144
and things like that. I think
more. And also, I didn't know.

601
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:50,578
And I still don't know. And I'm.
All interested in statistics,

602
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:54,328
which of course we can argue if
that's important or not. Uh, but

603
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:55,963
I felt like I should, like, we
are talking, we're always

604
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,598
talking

605
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:03,959
about this models and prob and
numbers and constants and things

606
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,838
like that, that I never had an
idea about, uh, which I was

607
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:09,689
trying to, but like, it seemed
like I'm really, really, really

608
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,588
like behind all of this. And I
don't have the, the, the passion

609
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:14,608
to, to learn. No.

610
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,638
Bekah: Um, so it's, it sounds
like you kind of knew what you

611
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:24,048
wanted to be doing and you did
kind of enjoy that research

612
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:28,068
aspect of things, but you knew
that was not gonna be like the

613
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,985
place that you. Your ideal job
or what you wanted to be doing.

614
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,902
So

615
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:37,373
how did you make that decision
to move from that research

616
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:40,462
position

617
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:43,503
and do something that you would
rather be doing?

618
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:50,148
Bogdan: so I never really knew
what I wanted to do in the time

619
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,191
all I wanted to, to do. No. All
I knew was so we. We were, we

620
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,363
were

621
00:28:57,364 --> 00:28:59,989
doing a lot of programming by
the end of my employment list.

622
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,614
So on

623
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,668
the way, um, after the last
summer, so basically last

624
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,722
summer,

625
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,773
cuz I left in February. Right?
So after last summer, a lot of

626
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,868
other. Not a lot like important
people that I was working close

627
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:22,308
with seniors left. So I was kind
of around trying stuff. Um, and

628
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:24,348
having another other people,
like on the same level with me

629
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,088
and

630
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:29,103
things like that, it really
became not, you know,

631
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:32,118
Productive.

632
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,619
And I'm not saying it is a bad
thing. I think it's a, it's,

633
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:34,759
it's

634
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,148
a great thing for them to kind
of have the, the, you know, this

635
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:39,588
growing experience and maybe
growing pains, cuz it was still

636
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:40,818
a

637
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:44,959
very young lab. Right. Kind of
understand that seniorship

638
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,353
matters and things like that.
And you need mentorship and you

639
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:47,628
need

640
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:50,598
seniors and things like that. So
there was a thing. So I was, I

641
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,929
was slacking a little bit behind
cuz I had a, I had a very weird

642
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:59,959
period after I got COVID. Um,
even a year after I was still

643
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,358
very sick and things like that.
So they were very, very nice and

644
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:07,278
kind to allow me to, to, to work
as, as, as much as I can, which

645
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,409
was not a lot. Right. Um, so I,
I, I, I did the work that I had

646
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,169
to do as, as, as much as I can.
And then when I got a little bit

647
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:17,441
better, um, I started looking
for jobs. And I wasn't sure what

648
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,713
I

649
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:25,384
want to do. I, I, I was, I think
in, by the end of the year, I

650
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:28,878
think it was November. Or
whatever I've been to summit in

651
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:33,499
Lisbon. Um, and I've seen all
these companies and all these

652
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:35,324
apps and all these software
engineers doing a, out a few

653
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:36,919
cool

654
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:38,105
things. And I was like, I wanna
do cool things, but I didn't

655
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,287
know

656
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:43,278
what a cool thing is. Uh, but I
just wanted to, you know, I just

657
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,709
wanted to feel like I'm doing
very cool things, which I was

658
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,788
doing at the moment, but in a
different way, not in an

659
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:47,867
academic

660
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,405
way. Right. Um, yeah, and I
just, I just applied to the

661
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:52,942
startups

662
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:54,668
that I knew that in Netherlands,
that kind of met there a bunch

663
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,393
to

664
00:30:56,394 --> 00:31:00,828
another companies and a bunch of
agencies. Cause I. Fred is very

665
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:05,209
much into like agencies. He also
has this very tiny agency doing

666
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:08,439
like branding and marketing for
people and things like that. Uh,

667
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:13,249
and he was living with me at the
moment. Uh, and, but he was away

668
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:16,818
and I started to apply for jobs
and randomly told him like, Hey,

669
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:20,538
did I applied for this creative
agencies, creative agency in

670
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,473
Amsterdam? What do you think
about it? And then. Flood get

671
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:24,408
so,

672
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,969
and he showed me and told me and
sent me all I could know about

673
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,298
agencies in the Netlands, which
is very cool, cuz I wasn't sure

674
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,848
if I wanted to do that, but it
finally started to make sense.

675
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:38,088
Like I need, I need something
very dynamic and I need to move

676
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,959
around, but I also need a
structure which you sometimes

677
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,739
arguably don't get in startups
and things like that. Um, so

678
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,199
yeah, like an agency seemed like
a, like a, like a good place,

679
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,659
uh,

680
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,793
but then realized. EV all of
that is project dependent or

681
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,897
client

682
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:56,593
dependent, right? Like you
really need to, to match with,

683
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,288
with the

684
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:00,313
client, the right clients and,
uh, yeah. To have the ability

685
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:02,338
to,

686
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,928
to be as flexible as I want to
be and things like that, which

687
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,248
of

688
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:11,878
course they could offer. Um, so
it's going well. yeah. Similar

689
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,558
what? I still not sure what I
wanna do. I'm just around

690
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,028
programing.

691
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:16,324
Bekah: Same.

692
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:22,557
Dan: Oh man. Um, I, I actually
wanted to swing back to sort of

693
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,987
change topics, but, uh, you were
talking about teaching, um, I

694
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,856
think when you were doing your
master's right, and you made a

695
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:32,027
joke about teaching, you're
basically teaching people how to

696
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:40,781
Google. Um, but I, I wa like, I
feel like, um, That's excuse me.

697
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,182
Maybe that's not what you expect
from a professor, but like that

698
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:45,701
is like the right way to learn.
That's what we try to teach

699
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:52,451
everybody. Um, not profess, like
whatever. I don't know what, um,

700
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,666
Amateur teach I don't know, uh,

701
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:57,761
Bogdan: no for sure. I watch

702
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,636
Dan: you know, but when I'm
trying to help somebody learn,

703
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:00,761
you know, one of the, one of
like learning how to Google

704
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:01,886
things and

705
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,296
figure things out for yourself
is like one of the biggest

706
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,706
skills to

707
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:06,372
learn, uh, when you're becoming
a developer. Right. Especially

708
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:08,037
for

709
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:12,446
the first time. Um, so I just
wondered if you could tell me a

710
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:14,906
little bit more about like that
experience of teaching in that

711
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:17,126
structured, um, you know, in a,
like a structured way as a, as

712
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:19,346
a,

713
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:22,991
as a. What do you call yourself
a professor? A, um, I don't know

714
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:24,221
what the right just

715
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:25,211
Bogdan: assistant,

716
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,831
Dan: assistant. Yeah. So as a
TA, like, but like what can you

717
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:28,240
just

718
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:32,382
describe a little bit more about
that from like, cuz I've watched

719
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:36,132
and been on both sides of, you
know, learning from sort of

720
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:39,432
independent online version.
Right. Um, but I don't think

721
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:42,791
we've had anybody on the podcast
who has like taught in that, uh,

722
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:47,201
taught computer science in, uh,
this structured way. Um,

723
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:48,386
Bogdan: Yeah, it was

724
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,741
Dan: might be misremembering
Bekah but I'm pretty So I'd like

725
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:52,362
to hear about it. Could you just
tell me more about that

726
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:52,781
experience?

727
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:54,642
Bogdan: No for sure. But also
like they take it with a grain

728
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:56,067
of

729
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,186
soul. Like I've been a, I was a
TA, like I was still a student.

730
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,836
Right. So I

731
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,102
Dan: Sure, sure. So, so you
weren't doing the lesson plans

732
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:06,251
and stuff, but, still you were,
I, I just would like to hear

733
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:07,811
about it cuz it's, it's like
the, the process of learning

734
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,371
this

735
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:12,641
stuff is endlessly fascinating
to me and um,

736
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,612
Bogdan: is. I think it's very,
yeah, I think it's, I think

737
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,021
education, especially in
computer science is very

738
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,430
fascinating

739
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:23,262
because it's so it's so I don't
know. It's yeah. Anyways, we'll

740
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,032
get it. Um, yeah, I think that
actually helped a lot, like

741
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,802
being

742
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:29,862
a TA, uh, helped a lot because I
don't think people have too many

743
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:33,911
expectations. I think, I don't
know. Uh, they didn't. I had

744
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:38,757
great students two times cuz
there were two periods. Um, And

745
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:45,476
it was, it was interesting cuz
the that's why I think it's very

746
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:50,547
fascinating. Like we had
different people of different

747
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:54,237
like levels, right? Like it
happened, they were all in first

748
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:57,657
year. Most problem. I think it
was first year. Yeah. Um, but

749
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,157
some of them had some
mathematics experience, some

750
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,657
programming,

751
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:04,947
some none and things like that,
but they, they all seemed to, to

752
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:09,632
kind of. Get stuck in the same
kind of places, which I think

753
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,521
it's it's, I think it's
interesting. Like I don't, I

754
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:15,572
don't know much about education.
Um, but I think it's very

755
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,561
interesting to kind of see how
they deal in different ways, um,

756
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:25,411
with that and what I used to do.
And I thought it was very funny,

757
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,862
not funny in a mean way. It's
just funny to, to just observe

758
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:32,581
it. It's just like, see how they
deal with it. And then like, let

759
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,944
them. Deal with in a way of
like, I was like, oh yeah, look,

760
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:37,302
your

761
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,161
colleague did it that way. Why
don't you. Go around this way

762
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,020
and

763
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:44,202
things like that, which I think
it was a nice, it was a nice,

764
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:46,016
like not bonding experience, but
kind of in a way of like level

765
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,830
it

766
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:51,521
down, especially cuz for some of
some, it was in my ear as well.

767
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,894
Like for some of us it was so,
so like intimidating to know

768
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:56,261
that we

769
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:59,922
had this people in the class
that were, you know, having

770
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,231
experienced in programming and
things like that. I don't know

771
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:06,081
why, cuz it's, it's never a
competition. Right? But it was

772
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,811
just weird. It was like my God,
they know everything and I don't

773
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:11,871
know nothing and things like
that. And then yeah, later it

774
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:15,771
happened for me to be in that
position and, you know, showing

775
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:20,092
people or students as a TA, like
to ask those stupid question is

776
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,882
very important. Uh, and to
Google, everything is very

777
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:29,021
important cuz I also never
understood. Why it was seen. So

778
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,891
it was not seen as like, you
know, frowned upon. It's just

779
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,552
like a thing of like the, the
stigma of like, oh, I need to

780
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,921
know things. It's like, you
don't know Java words or

781
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:41,290
whatever, you

782
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:45,942
know how to, to take you know,
so yeah, I think it was very

783
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:49,001
cultivating for me as well, and
also Googling in front of people

784
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,172
at school cuz you know, it.

785
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,106
Dan: Yeah, yeah.

786
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:55,782
Bogdan: especially I'm good at
Googling. So I think I I like to

787
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:56,952
show off my skills as

788
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:58,796
Dan: I, and it is a skill, you
know? I mean, like, and it's

789
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,536
that

790
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,836
it's about like crafting the
right, you know, like figuring

791
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,096
out what's at Google. You know,
what I mean is, is, is hard.

792
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,356
And,

793
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,186
and that's like, that's
something I try to do some,

794
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,016
some, uh, you

795
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,786
know, when people ask questions
is. If it's something that was

796
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,556
an

797
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:18,056
easy, easy, like Google search
for me, I will try to share what

798
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,903
I search for, you know, like,
like not, don't like claim that

799
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,745
I

800
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,071
knew this off the top of my
head, you know, but like, I also

801
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:26,396
wanna

802
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,666
try to, like, I don't mean to do
that, to be like, you could have

803
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,487
just Googled this, you know, you
know what I mean? Like, cuz

804
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,646
that's not like there's that,
that anytime you're using that,

805
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:38,621
just word, like the word just.
Probably a bad, like a, like a,

806
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,736
you wanna rethink what you're
thinking because, um, the, I

807
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,851
knew

808
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,276
the right terms to search for,
to find that answer. You know

809
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:45,551
what I

810
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:47,292
mean? Um, but not everybody
does. And, uh, you know, you,

811
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,032
that's

812
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,612
something you learn over time.
Um, and it's, it's an important

813
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:52,737
skill, uh, with computer
science, a lot of the answers

814
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,862
are out

815
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:59,112
there. Um, if you can find them,
you know, um, I've also been

816
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:02,831
trying to do that on, on our, on
our stream sometimes is, is just

817
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,192
Googling things. The same thing,
you know, cuz we're, we're just

818
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:07,632
like learning, uh, you know,
Kirk and I are doing that type

819
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,072
script

820
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,192
Tuesdays. And so I'm Kirk is
mostly teaching. I'm mostly

821
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:13,737
learning, but it's like, yeah,
we just didn't know something.

822
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,282
So we

823
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:17,246
looked it up and there's no, I
don't feel bad about that at

824
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:19,210
all.

825
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:22,032
You know? And, and nor should I,
you know, I, I that's a great,

826
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:25,331
uh, I dunno, that's a great
attitude to have. Uh, I would

827
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,302
love to see that as a, as a TA,
you know, cuz I think it's, it

828
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:33,041
can be easy to when you are. Um,
when you're teaching or in that

829
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:37,541
position of like, I dunno, I'm
teaching something, it could be

830
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,626
easy to like, wanna know the
answers or wanna like, like,

831
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,711
seem

832
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,411
like, you know, the answers so
that people trust you more or

833
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,382
something like, not in like a
nefarious way, but just as a, as

834
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:50,891
like a, I don't know, for me,
this is my personal speaking. It

835
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,406
it's like I, I can fall into
that trap and, and I try not

836
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:53,921
like, I,

837
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,578
I, I, it takes effort to
sometimes for me to. Not do

838
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,495
that.

839
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,737
you know, because I don't
obviously know everything and,

840
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,217
um, I don't know. And it's okay.
You know, it's like,

841
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:09,012
Bekah: so much of it is based on
our education, right? Because

842
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:12,822
like you're tested and you're
expected to know information,

843
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:16,452
right. You're not expected to
look up information and find the

844
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:21,552
answers. And so then going. On
through years of doing that,

845
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:26,021
there's it, it feels like it's
not successful to have to look

846
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:29,081
something up like, oh, you
failed, you should already know

847
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:33,072
this, but it's, that's not the
case, especially with this now.

848
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:37,572
So, you know, it's always how to
find the answer is more

849
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:42,222
important. And I read a tweet. I
don't know who tweeted it out,

850
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:45,161
but it was like the difference
between a junior developer and a

851
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,406
senior developer is. They're
more effective. Senior

852
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,646
developers are

853
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:53,757
more effective at Googling. You
just get faster, you know, more

854
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:58,257
words that you can use, you can
narrow it down more quickly. Um,

855
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:03,641
and, and I think that. That's a
lot of what it is, right? Like

856
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,086
knowing what to look for and
what the approach is because

857
00:40:06,086 --> 00:40:08,261
you, you

858
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:12,612
have to figure it out. And tech
moves too quickly to memorize

859
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,356
everything that you're doing. So
knowing how to Google and

860
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:18,040
knowing

861
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:23,112
that that's what's expected of
you is really important. It's

862
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:25,286
that. Should not be asking for
the answers. Every time you hit

863
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,460
a

864
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,201
roadblock, you should be looking
things up and figuring out how

865
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,941
to

866
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,851
do them. And that's Nick and I,
Nick Taylor, and I did a lunch

867
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,056
and learn last week where we
kind of talked about like, what

868
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:38,261
do you

869
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:40,632
do? How do you navigate those
challenges? How do you ask

870
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,052
questions? That kind of thing.
Cuz it's

871
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:46,091
Bogdan: Yeah, that's I, yeah, I
think that's great. The, the,

872
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:48,085
the

873
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:51,086
way you put it, because I find,
so what I think about is

874
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:55,197
different. I find with all the
respect and love for my parents,

875
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:58,246
for example, that call me every
time their phone doesn't work.

876
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,987
Right. And I'm thinking about
this, cuz it's like, look, what

877
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:04,632
I'm doing is just. I don't know
your phone by heart, you know,

878
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,791
they also have Android phone so
I'm like, no, I'm not saying

879
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,831
it's

880
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:11,862
a weird thing. I just like, I
didn't use an Android for eight

881
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,501
years now. I'm like, I'm not
gonna, I'm not gonna know where,

882
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,262
what you have to press. I'm just
gonna Google it and things like

883
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:22,061
that. But then I kind of. Took
one step back and realized like

884
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:25,211
what, what happened with me at
least? And I don't know, I'm not

885
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,931
sure for how many other, like
people Eastern Europeans is that

886
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,941
relatable? Um, not Eastern
Europeans, everybody that

887
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,951
doesn't

888
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:35,051
speak natively English. I
believe like we didn't, I didn't

889
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,671
have a

890
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,797
computer for a very long time.
Right. And when I had it for the

891
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,402
first time I was young, uh,
still young, but like, I didn't

892
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:44,007
know

893
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,606
English, but once I started to
learn English, I realized how

894
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:50,967
much, how many things you can
Google and how many YouTube

895
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:55,047
videos you can watch. It was
insane. It was like the, the

896
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:57,597
whole world open. And finally, I
started to Google everything,

897
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:00,746
like, even for my mom, like, I
was like, Hey, do you did this?

898
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:01,946
And no, no, no, no, no. Yeah.
And then I think that's the

899
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:03,146
thing.

900
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,757
Like I think that's where they,
they, they, they draw the line,

901
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:09,222
you know, it's just like,
Navigating the internet to, to

902
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,546
finances and things like that.
Um, which of course it's a

903
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:13,870
skill,

904
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,296
right? Like you have to learn
it. Uh, they didn't take the

905
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:16,721
time to

906
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:20,262
do it, so that's okay. I'm gonna
do it for them. uh, but yeah,

907
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:23,081
like I think that's, that's
that's yeah. That's like, yeah.

908
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:27,282
How, how you're supposed to, to,
to, to think about things like,

909
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:28,647
am I supposed to know by phone
by heart? No, of course not.

910
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,012
Cause

911
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:32,681
it has thousands of menus.

912
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:36,117
Bekah: It's not necessary, you
know,

913
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:37,886
Bogdan: Exactly. Why would you
exactly? Yeah. Why would you

914
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:39,311
add,

915
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,034
know of that? If you do it once
a year or whatever, Which

916
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:44,757
happened

917
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:49,257
to me by the way about talking
about phone. I'm sorry. I was, I

918
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:53,606
was coming back from a concert
the other week and it was like a

919
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:59,277
three hour strain ride and my
phone just froze and it was not

920
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,277
dead, but it was just like, the
screen was open, but I couldn't

921
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:06,686
click anything. And I tried to
restart it the way I know it and

922
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:08,264
things like that. And it didn't
work. And. I didn't have

923
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:09,842
anything

924
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:12,601
on me. Like it was just my phone
and my wallet. So I sit on a

925
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,031
train for three hours doing
nothing was a new experience.

926
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:17,461
you

927
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:21,211
know, I never, I never get to do
that also in the middle of the

928
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:23,911
night, but then I got home,
Google it from my laptop and

929
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:27,362
there is a second way to restart
your phone, you know? And that

930
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:29,326
worked actually. And I was like,
wow, should I know this? I

931
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:31,290
don't,

932
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,251
I don't think so.

933
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:33,987
Dan: Why didn't you just look it
up on your phone?

934
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:38,891
Bogdan: Yeah, exactly what
right. Yeah. exactly. Yeah.

935
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:39,806
Dan: Yeah.

936
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:43,422
Bogdan: Yeah, no, but it was a
nice three hours of thinking

937
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:46,302
Dan: Wow. So did you like, Did
you like go into alternate

938
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:46,751
dimensions or

939
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:47,097
Bekah: do you

940
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:53,652
Bogdan: yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now it
was weird. I wished I wished

941
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,501
people would just sit in the
same, like kind of train

942
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,141
compartment with me and speak
English cuz everybody was

943
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,961
speaking Dutch around me and I
was like, please someone speak

944
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:03,611
English. So I just, I just
wanted to hear it. I didn't, I

945
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:05,261
didn't

946
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:08,262
wanna talk with them. I just
wanted to hear so to like, think

947
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:13,722
about it's weird. I never get to
do that. No no, I don't. Uh, so

948
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:16,722
that's why, um, but yeah, I
don't, I never get to, to, to

949
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:20,771
think on my own. I just have
music playing in a background or

950
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,152
something, you know, it's very
weird.

951
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,241
Bekah: Yeah, it's interesting
how much time we occupy our

952
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:27,071
brains

953
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:32,202
constantly. Like there's a, a
need, I read this book bored and

954
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,652
brilliant. Maybe. Um, somebody
recommended it to me and it was

955
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:39,311
really good. Like your brain
needs time to be able to process

956
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:42,031
different things, to be
creative, to, um, Like store

957
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,751
knowledge that

958
00:44:44,757 --> 00:44:47,709
you have accumulated. And I
think that we don't do that. I

959
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:50,661
mean, I

960
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:52,941
like I'm in the car. I have a
podcast on I'm going for a run.

961
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,921
I

962
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:58,282
have a podcast on I'm in my
house. I have four kids. Nobody

963
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:02,572
ever stops. Like, I feel like I
might be afraid of silence at

964
00:45:02,722 --> 00:45:06,771
this point. Like what, what will
happen if I spend 10 minutes

965
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,661
being silent, let alone three
hours, like.

966
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:10,946
Bogdan: I think I am, but I
don't know. I never re I never,

967
00:45:10,946 --> 00:45:12,536
I never

968
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,416
got a time to actually think
about it. I, I bet I am. Right.

969
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:19,016
Like, I can, I should be able to
go on a walk and not listen to

970
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,044
music. Right? Like that's.
That's what I was, but I can't.

971
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:23,067
And I

972
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,277
think it's weird. Like, I, I
don't know. It's a very weird

973
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:27,297
thing and I don't wanna,

974
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,036
Dan: the same thing. I have

975
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,896
Bekah: none of us meditating,
then we're not.

976
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:31,586
Dan: Oh God,

977
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,806
Bogdan: no way. There's no way
is gonna work.

978
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:39,567
Dan: I, uh, no, I have the, so I
have the AirPods pro and so like

979
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,991
to push play, you squeeze the
thing that sticks down, you

980
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,415
know,

981
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,419
and the other day I walked outta
my office and. I didn't have

982
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:45,971
them

983
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:48,101
in, but I thought I had them in
and I squeezed my ear a little

984
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,481
and I'm like, well, that was,
that was real weird.

985
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:53,817
Bogdan: Wow.

986
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,751
Dan: I'm just so used to having
them in my ears.

987
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:59,097
Bogdan: Wow. That's
embarrassing.

988
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:02,036
Dan: Like, yeah. I need to
listen to my podcast for 30

989
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,071
seconds

990
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:04,302
while I go get water. Like yeah.

991
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:07,481
Bekah: Yeah, no, it's true.
Yeah.

992
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,646
Bogdan: Or on the toilet, like
I'm going through the toilet. I

993
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:14,456
can't just like, that's weird.

994
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:19,737
Bekah: have to be occupied. I
will say it's, it's nice weather

995
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:22,646
here. Like very spring weather
and my kids like to swing on the

996
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,551
swings and I like to swing on
the swings and that is like

997
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,456
maybe the

998
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:29,016
only time that I can just, I'm
still like moving and. My

999
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,576
brother

1000
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:34,067
was telling me, uh, I can't
remember. I think I was a

1001
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:36,227
neurologist that, that was
saying to improve your memory.

1002
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,387
You

1003
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:42,106
should try thinking in complete
sentences for like 10 minutes a

1004
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:45,376
day or something. And so the
other day I was like practicing

1005
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:47,159
that as I was swinging on the
swing next to my kid, like.

1006
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:48,942
There

1007
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:52,481
is a tree and the leaves on the
tree are very greatly. I didn't

1008
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:55,541
say it out loud. It was just in
my head, I'm this is ridiculous.

1009
00:46:55,541 --> 00:47:00,581
I never talk sentences, first of
all. But, but also it was really

1010
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:05,112
hard. I was like, I was shocked
at how much, my mind wondered

1011
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:09,132
while I was trying to stay
focused. It was like, wait a

1012
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:13,211
minute. I've just like, where,
how did I get to this to-do list

1013
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,791
that I'm rattling off in my head
because I was just talking to

1014
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,592
myself about tree leaves, you
know?

1015
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:22,077
Bogdan: That's that like yeah,
exactly. The, the way the brain

1016
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:26,306
just like worked when, when you
don't do like my, so my, my

1017
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:27,851
therapist told me, like, when I
used to have this anxiety

1018
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:29,396
things,

1019
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:33,447
like whatever moments, like my,
my super plan, which I, 100%

1020
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,461
taught it. It's working, cuz it
made me feel better, was just

1021
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:38,576
like, if, if I feel weird, I'll
just like straight up like put

1022
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:40,691
on

1023
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:44,351
something, something that I can
hear and go for a walk for

1024
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:47,081
example and things like that,
which turns out it's not good

1025
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:51,431
cause no, cause at the end she
was like, why don't you just

1026
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:56,067
like. Sit down and like, think
about what's happening or like

1027
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:59,487
let your, your, your mind
understand like what's happening

1028
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,302
and why you feel that way and
things like that, which I'm

1029
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,117
gonna

1030
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:07,436
give it to her. It worked for me
in a, in a very weird way. It's

1031
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,663
just like, But then you start
to, like, I start to like, you

1032
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:11,890
know,

1033
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,126
like, as you said, like realize,
oh, that's those lives there

1034
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:16,361
that

1035
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:19,121
are actually very nice you know,
and things like that. Which,

1036
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:22,572
which never happens when, when
yeah, I even, yeah. Like I, even

1037
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:26,442
before sleep, I like to, to, to,
to this to hear something and

1038
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:28,954
things like that. I had a, I had
a friend coming into my room.

1039
00:48:28,954 --> 00:48:31,461
And

1040
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:32,766
I was listening to music and he
was like, do you listen? Is he

1041
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:34,071
in

1042
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:40,972
your bed? Why don't you? And
turns out not a lot of people.

1043
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:45,952
Yeah. It's weird. The brain is
weird.

1044
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:47,802
Bekah: Yeah.

1045
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:48,282
Dan: is weird.

1046
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:50,456
Bekah: I mean, I even like I
have a fan running when I'm

1047
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:51,791
sleeping,

1048
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:57,251
because I can't take the silence
ever, uh, sleeping in hotels is

1049
00:48:57,257 --> 00:49:01,001
like the, the worst I hate
sleeping in hotel. They're quiet

1050
00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:04,242
or they're really noisy. We
stayed in this weekend and there

1051
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:06,851
were people out in the hallway
until like 2:00 AM.

1052
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:07,751
Dan: Uh,

1053
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:08,246
Bogdan: I don't know.

1054
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,411
Bekah: That wasn't ideal, cuz
well, I couldn't understand what

1055
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,141
they were saying because it was
a different language. So then it

1056
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:14,411
was like

1057
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:15,956
Bogdan: I'm saying with Dutch

1058
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:16,302
Bekah: um,

1059
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:19,032
Dan: they happy? Were they happy
or are they angry or

1060
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:24,896
Bekah: am, I, I'm not sure. I
feel like all of the above, but

1061
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:28,436
at one point there was like, uh,
this wasn't, this was during the

1062
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:33,657
day, there were two young boys,
like wondering down the hallway

1063
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:36,447
and you can tell their mom was
the one that came outta the room

1064
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,536
because like she had a total mom
face on those kids were not

1065
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:42,177
supposed to be wondering the
hallway. And she walked with

1066
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:46,737
like, you are in big trouble.
Like maybe my favorite part of

1067
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:49,376
entire hotel stay. Like, I feel
you I've been there.

1068
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,947
Dan: universal universal
language

1069
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,431
Bogdan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1070
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:54,777
Dan: now.

1071
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:01,902
Bogdan: yeah. I used to, I, I
used to live on a moderately

1072
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:05,231
crowded city street for mass
street. I mean, where there were

1073
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,211
a bunch of bars and cafes and
things like that. And every

1074
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:11,742
single night people would fight.
But it would fight in Dodge,

1075
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:15,702
which was so frustrating. Cuz I
was so curious, like, no, like

1076
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:19,782
seriously they, they were
fighting. So first of all, so

1077
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:23,831
long, like, you know, you scream
at each other for a few seconds

1078
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:25,931
and you go, but they were
fighting for so long and every

1079
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:28,226
single night I was so that it
was my main motivation to learn,

1080
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,521
just

1081
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:33,402
to understand what, what are
they fighting about? Like

1082
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:33,972
Dan: the drama,

1083
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,206
Bogdan: yeah. Like exactly like
Yeah, but then I moved so I

1084
00:50:36,206 --> 00:50:38,081
don't

1085
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:38,262
have.

1086
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:41,607
Bekah: I would be tempted to
record it and then try it and

1087
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,137
get

1088
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:43,827
it translated.

1089
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,931
Bogdan: after? Never do that.
Maybe I should.

1090
00:50:47,637 --> 00:50:47,697
Bekah: Uh,

1091
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:51,161
Bogdan: I try that with the
doctor's office a bunch of times

1092
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,981
when they have the number
pressing things, but it didn't

1093
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:54,851
work that well.

1094
00:50:55,947 --> 00:50:56,817
Bekah: that's frustrating.

1095
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:57,851
Bogdan: voices, maybe.

1096
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:04,653
Bekah: Um, okay. So you've kind
of like navigated all over this

1097
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:07,954
career path. I feel like you've
done a lot of different things

1098
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:11,914
and have a lot of knowledge. Um,
and it seems like you're on a

1099
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:18,378
path that you're enjoying. What
advice do you have for anybody

1100
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:19,923
else? That's kind of like
navigating where they wanna go.

1101
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,468
I

1102
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,708
especially think like there's so
many people coming into tech

1103
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:30,318
right now. And I think that
there's this focus on, you have

1104
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,628
to do this one thing. Like you
have to do whatever program or

1105
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,599
whatever self-taught path you
went on, but there are a lot of

1106
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,516
different jobs in tech, you
know? So what advice, like,

1107
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:44,433
based on

1108
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,224
your journey, would you give to
people who are like doing that

1109
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:49,173
exploration and trying to break
in right now?

1110
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:54,369
Bogdan: So, I mean, without
adding to the gate, keeping cuz

1111
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:57,818
you know, everybody, I feel like
we all have our ways and things

1112
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,909
like that. I'm not gate keeping
it, but I can, I can talk about

1113
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,958
like what worked, which is very
tricky as well. Cuz um, I was, I

1114
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,498
was actually talking a few days
ago with someone, with a person

1115
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:11,708
that also just started switch
from physics to computer science

1116
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:16,454
and now they got an internship.
Um, and I think it's hard. I,

1117
00:52:16,454 --> 00:52:17,714
it's hard for me to be in that
position. And also, I think I

1118
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:18,974
ask

1119
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:21,494
a question about this, uh, at
the other day at Virtual Coffee.

1120
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:24,014
Um,

1121
00:52:24,043 --> 00:52:28,724
because I, I still feel like
everything is so overwhelming

1122
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:33,313
already, and it's so hard to
find ways to do things like me

1123
00:52:33,313 --> 00:52:35,893
chipping in with things would
add to that. But I mean, it's,

1124
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:38,473
it's,

1125
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:42,853
it's, it's very interesting. So
like my, my, my, my advice in

1126
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:47,958
that regard, Was what I was
thinking at the moment based on

1127
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:52,773
my school experience and my jobs
that I had on the way. Is, and

1128
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:54,828
I'm not sure exactly how valid
it is not valid. It's just like,

1129
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,883
we,

1130
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,373
we already have arguments about
this, right? Like the way the

1131
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:00,873
right way to start to, to learn
programming and things like

1132
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:02,373
that.

1133
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,284
Oh, should you learn, react,
although you don't know

1134
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:08,403
JavaScript on whatever, but what
I, what I find very interesting

1135
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:12,213
about my, my experience is that
I spent so much time trying to.

1136
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,478
Things fundamental things, which
of course are very important.

1137
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:16,143
I'm

1138
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,528
not gonna argue that helps us
in, in many, many ways to, to do

1139
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,913
our

1140
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:25,443
day jobs, but I didn't have time
to, to focus, you know, like

1141
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:30,094
profess not professionally, but
like academically on things that

1142
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:32,691
I'm actually using at my job.
So. Look, you do need Java. You

1143
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:35,283
do,

1144
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:38,403
you do need to, to know
JavaScript to, to, to work and

1145
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,594
react and things like that. But
if you spend too much time on

1146
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:44,224
that, you'll never, you you'll
get a little bit later to these

1147
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,444
things and you might, as I did
it with electrical engineering,

1148
00:53:46,444 --> 00:53:48,664
I,

1149
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:51,784
I, I missed, I missed the
opportunity to get excited about

1150
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:56,974
it. So I feel like if we would
spend so much time on learning

1151
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:58,961
the. Java script, and this is
not advocating me. This is not

1152
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:00,948
me

1153
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,298
advocating for people, not the
basics. I'm just saying like the

1154
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:10,018
division of time is very
important. So I think doing

1155
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:14,748
mainly doing, I don't know, for
example, frameworks, and then

1156
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:19,458
picking up as a hobby or as is
the second thing, learning the

1157
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:24,094
fundamentally that you don't.
Would accelerate it a little bit

1158
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:25,758
more in the way of cuz at the
end of the day, as, as you know,

1159
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:27,093
as

1160
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:30,903
developers as engineers, we have
to, to find solutions and to

1161
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,954
build things right. And we're
gonna, we're going to eventually

1162
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:39,784
in, in some setups, you, you get
paid to use the best tools you

1163
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:44,628
have to build the best things
you can build. And. How you get

1164
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:47,809
there, like the tools you use to
get there. I feel like they're

1165
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:51,559
more important than the things
that I spent a lot of time

1166
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:55,909
learning in, you know, all these
formal setups, which was great.

1167
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:59,059
I'm not denying that, but just
thinking out loud, I think that

1168
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:02,210
was the things focusing on
tools, um, and then learning the

1169
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,357
basics

1170
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,619
and fundamentals as we go. Cuz I
think that would help us, you

1171
00:55:09,623 --> 00:55:14,583
know, get a little bit more
creative. I think, I dunno. I

1172
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:18,273
dunno if it makes sense. but
that's what I was thinking about

1173
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:18,724
the other day.

1174
00:55:19,548 --> 00:55:20,868
Bekah: No, I think that makes
total sense. And I think that's

1175
00:55:20,868 --> 00:55:22,188
a

1176
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,518
great way to end the episode. So
I wanna thank you Bogdan for
