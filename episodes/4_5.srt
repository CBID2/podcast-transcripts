00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:08,685
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season four, episode five of the

2
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,407
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:14,129
that

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,269
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,844
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,419
their

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,300
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,679
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,058
it with

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,879
you here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:35,031
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we sat
down with Suze Shardlow. Suze is

12
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,942
an award winning community
manager, coder, tech writer and

13
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,301
tech event MC and she currently
leads the developer community at

14
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:44,091
Redis. We had a really
interesting conversation with

15
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,642
Suze. She's done a million
different things throughout her

16
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,981
life and her career and she
shared with us how her

17
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:52,131
experiences have informed her
time as a software developer and

18
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:52,972
a community leader.

19
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,424
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

20
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,454
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

21
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,314
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We

22
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,174
hope

23
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:14,284
you enjoy this episode. Today's
random question is if you could

24
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:21,084
pick a fictional world to live
in, what would it be? So I am

25
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:26,515
Bekah, I'm a front end developer
from a small town in Ohio, and

26
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,094
there are so many cool fictional
worlds that it's hard, like do

27
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:29,643
do

28
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:34,194
you want to totally go fantasy
and a different world? Want in

29
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,959
space? I definitely don't want
to live underwater. Um, so where

30
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,724
do

31
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:43,644
I want to live? Now I can't now
I can't even think of a

32
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,564
fictional

33
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,045
world that I want to live in.

34
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:49,629
Dan: Do you get to choose who to
be in the place that you live?

35
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:50,019
You know,

36
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:52,325
Bekah: I you're going to be
yourself. I think that's the

37
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:52,704
rules.

38
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,090
Dan: But I mean, like you said
Harry Potter, like, you know,

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Hogwarts or something, but just

40
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,045
Bekah: You're just Dan at
Hogwarts.

41
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,982
Dan: Just a muggle. A muggle
Dan, you know, like that would

42
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,919
be

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,219
worse.

44
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:13,134
Bekah: Yeah. I, um, I'm just
going to go. I, you know, I

45
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:18,990
really liked the world of X-Men.
So, I I'm going to go live with

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,330
the X-Men in that world. Um,
because I have always enjoyed.

47
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,685
Dan: A friend, a friend to the
mutants

48
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,960
Bekah: I will be, I will be an
ally to the mutants I draw.

49
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:36,699
Dan: Where you could be a, a
mutant advocate or would that

50
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,723
be.

51
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:46,365
Like a like dev you got like a
big Twitter account and stuff.

52
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,724
Suze: Mutant community engineer.

53
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:48,814
Bekah: Yeah.

54
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:51,194
Suze: nice.

55
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:56,004
Dan: Um, hi, I'm, I'm Dan. I,
uh, do web stuff. I live in

56
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:02,125
Cleveland. Um, my fictional
world. I was like, I wanna go

57
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,330
somewhere where it's a little
less. Maybe where there's no

58
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,090
computers, honestly. Uh, you
know, all the ones that I keep

59
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,639
thinking of, there's like a lot
of strife and that didn't,

60
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,809
wouldn't be fun. You know, I
want to go somewhere relaxing.

61
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:15,979
Maybe

62
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,789
just like the, it called
Hobbiton? Is

63
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,685
Bekah: Yeah, that's a really
good one

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,219
Dan: Without all the bad stuff
that's happening, um, to feel

65
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,449
like they had some good times
there too, you know, so just

66
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,679
like

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,969
some chill, more chill and,

68
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,775
Bekah: or Rivendale, that would
be sweet too.

69
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,360
Dan: Wait what's.

70
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,444
Bekah: Where the Elves live.

71
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,585
Dan: Oh, yeah, that seems cool.
But they seem like pretty

72
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:40,544
serious, you know, the hobbits
like have like taverns and, you

73
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,209
know, you know what I mean?
Like, I don't think they drink

74
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,874
any, any

75
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,794
beer. elves don't drink, you

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,279
Bekah: I was don't. drink beer.
Oh, we need a fact check on

77
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,718
that.

78
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,259
Okay.

79
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,585
Dan: obviously Kirk is probably

80
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:51,810
Bekah: Kirk

81
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,104
Dan: out loud at us. I'm sure a
bunch of different things.

82
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:57,305
Suze: It wasn't me Kirk, it
wasn't me.

83
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,909
Dan: Uh, I'm going with, I'm
sticking with Hobbiton though.

84
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,133
I,

85
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,264
I liked the houses in the hill
too, you know, like there, the

86
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,264
whole vibe.

87
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:06,764
Suze: Cozy.

88
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:07,705
Dan: Yeah.

89
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:12,724
Suze: Nice. Well, my name's Suze
Shardlow. wear so many hats, I

90
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:15,335
don't even know where to start.
I'm a software engineer, coding

91
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,869
instructor, published tech
author, and a developer

92
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,403
community

93
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,054
manager based in London,
England, in case you couldn't

94
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,704
tell from

95
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:27,725
the funny accent, and if that
wasn't enough of a fantasy world

96
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,790
to be living. Uh, this question
is really hard. I don't know. I,

97
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,979
I'm not really into fantasy
books, but worlds that you

98
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,869
escape

99
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,470
to when you go to the movies and
say, the first thing that came

100
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,899
into my head was The Truman
Show. Because one of my favorite

101
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,328
things

102
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,949
is to look at the sky,
especially like on a day this,

103
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,569
we do

104
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,750
actually have blue sky today is
quite cold. There's a few clouds

105
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,479
and I look, and I the end. Yeah.
Uh, he went to the edge didn't

106
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,879
he

107
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,569
went to the sky and there was a
of steps on the door. I often

108
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,300
kind of think, you know, We're
quite insignificant in the grand

109
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,360
scheme of things and we are all
just kind of on the stage.

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,420
aren't

111
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,540
we? Um, so yeah, I feel like
going on the Truman Show would

112
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,360
be, uh, would be a good place to
live.

113
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,149
Bekah: That's fascinating. I
love The Truman Show it's right

114
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,573
up

115
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:18,694
there...

116
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,100
Suze: I need watch that again.
Yeah.

117
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,894
Bekah: Ever like big fish. I
don't know if you've, what's a

118
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:27,245
movie and a play and a book. Um,
but it's, it's a journey. So

119
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,704
they're going to different
places that would be cool too.

120
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:30,894
Dan: Do you say Reel big Fish?

121
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:32,314
Bekah: big fish.

122
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:32,735
Dan: They're a ska band

123
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:37,384
Bekah: No, there's there's no
real in and fact check for you

124
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:39,804
Legolas' people in particular
traded wines from the south

125
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,914
quite

126
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,845
often, so

127
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,274
Dan: Did drink them though? Or
did, just like, you know,

128
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:47,055
profiting

129
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,814
Bekah: I believe that they are.
Um, let's see. Are there

130
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,169
Dan: Yeah. If you said like,
they like sip fancy wines, you

131
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,504
know,

132
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:56,894
like, you know, believe that.

133
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,014
Bekah: Which one of the
characters in Lord of the rings

134
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:05,435
can't get drunk? That's one of
the characters, right? Is that.

135
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:12,035
is that one of the elves? All
right, sorry. I'm going, going

136
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:12,605
down the.

137
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,500
Dan: Isn't that Wolverine
somebody, the healing, somebody

138
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,790
with a healing thing can't get
drunk.

139
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:21,279
Suze: We already in the rabbit
hole. Well, that must be a

140
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,699
record.

141
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,115
Dan: Honestly, Kirk was poking
at us a couple of episodes ago.

142
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,300
And

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,139
so now it just like.

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,769
Bekah: yeah.

145
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:28,594
Dan: We'll just have a little
Kirk segment where we really

146
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:29,599
make

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,439
him mad and then, uh,

148
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,579
Suze: Poor old Kirk
...provoking. It's not nice.

149
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,399
Bekah: Um, well, thanks so much
for being here with us today.

150
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,229
Um,

151
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,589
there's so many different ways
that we can approach this

152
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:47,119
conversation, because like you
said, in the intro, you do all

153
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,649
of

154
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,214
the things, but let's just start
with how you got to this point

155
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,779
in

156
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,310
your career.

157
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:58,524
Suze: Okay, I'll give you the
short version. Cause, uh, it's

158
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:03,084
like two decades long, so, well,
two decades along since I left

159
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:07,370
university. And then another two
decades before that. So yeah,

160
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,579
then my whole coding journey
started when I was a small child

161
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,509
in the 1980s. And I don't really
remember where this computer

162
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:15,859
appeared from, but my dad
must've liked gone out and

163
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,089
bought it and

164
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,795
brought it home one day. So we
had a BBC micro, which is a. Uh,

165
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,149
computer that was actually
developed and made in the UK.

166
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,503
And

167
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:29,024
it was sponsored by the BBC,
which I think a lot of folks

168
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:33,314
around the world have heard of.
Um, and it was accompanied by a

169
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:36,495
TV show that they showed on the
BBC. And in those days we didn't

170
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:39,975
have the internet. So you kind
of had to watch the TV and write

171
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:43,274
down the code and type it into
your computer. And or use a book

172
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:46,995
or use magazines and things like
that. But the, um, so I was

173
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,485
probably about five when I got
that computer. And then I

174
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:53,355
programmed that like, well into
my teens and stuff into the

175
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,154
1990s. Um, and then there came a
point at school where you have

176
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,953
to

177
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:00,464
decide what you want to do, but
the UK education system. And I

178
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,294
don't think the UK is unique in
this. Um, doesn't know what to

179
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,124
do

180
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,007
with girls that like computers.
And it still doesn't know what

181
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,889
to

182
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,254
do with girls that like
computers. So when we had

183
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,619
careers

184
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,990
days and things like that at
school, I was never actually

185
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,949
shown anybody that was doing
programming for living man or

186
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,875
woman or, or gender. So, um,
yeah, we were just shown like

187
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,584
lawyers and doctors and vets and
things like that. And nobody

188
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,264
ever

189
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:29,345
sort of said, you can do this as
a living. So, um, and also at

190
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:33,095
school they didn't offer
computing subjects. Um, they

191
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,995
didn't offer any computing
classes, but we did have a

192
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:38,195
computing club, which I was very
heavily involved with, but, but

193
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,640
for some reason they didn't
offer any actual classes. Um, so

194
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,085
then,

195
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:47,279
so therefore my path to taking a
degree in it, wasn't really that

196
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,740
clear and it didn't occur to me
that maybe you can go do the

197
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,700
degree without taking it at
school and stuff. Cause again,

198
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,549
had no role role models. None of
the teachers were interested in

199
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,110
it. So I went to university and
took the most versatile degree

200
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,537
that I could think of, which was
business. 'cause I thought,

201
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,964
yeah,

202
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,065
that probably lends itself to a
few things. Still don't really

203
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:09,125
know what I wanna do, but, um,
one of my ambitions when I was

204
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,579
younger was I really wanted to
be a radio presenter. So I

205
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,033
thought,

206
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,735
okay, if I take do marketing or
something like that, it's quite

207
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:17,134
close to media. So that's what
they've specialized in marketing

208
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:22,565
and then came out of university
and just kind of got my first

209
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,009
marketing job and then just
stayed in marketing for quite a

210
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,549
long time, but it was always
still interested in technology

211
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,129
and try to get sort of
technology, adjacent marketing

212
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,899
roles. So one of the roles that
I did was marketing manager for

213
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,669
an

214
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:38,850
IT company. And then when I got
made redundant from that. When I

215
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,559
joined, um, the police here in
London as a communications

216
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,975
manager, so supporting
technology rollouts with

217
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:48,240
communications

218
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,919
campaigns, um, we've had about
50,000 users at the time, police

219
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,629
officers and police staff. And
if you think about, you know,

220
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,339
this

221
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,159
at the time, there were about
30,000 police officers in London

222
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,919
and every single one of those
officers was using a radio when

223
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,440
they went out. So we, then we
upgraded all the radios I put

224
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,054
together campaigns to support
those type of tech rollouts. But

225
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:14,195
then I was at the police for
quite a long time and still kind

226
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,619
of thought this isn't really
what I want to be doing forever,

227
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,043
but

228
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:21,424
what do I really want to do? So
I did quite a lot of reading to

229
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,514
figure out what I wanted to do.
And one of the pieces of advice

230
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:27,455
that I kept coming across was
think about what you enjoy doing

231
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,095
when you were younger. And I
thought, oh yeah, actually I

232
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,815
enjoy coding when I was younger.
So I, uh, I decided to go back

233
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:36,934
and do that. But I think, cause
well, I forgot to mention was

234
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:40,235
when I was doing the marketing
roles, I was still like making

235
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,764
websites and things like that.
So I was still really interested

236
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,293
in

237
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:46,054
still trying to do things, but
just didn't see a path to

238
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:48,575
actually get to do this
professionally. Meanwhile,

239
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,907
sitting there with dev teams
that were full of men. Um, but

240
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,239
yeah,

241
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,189
it just didn't seem to be a
clear route for me. So I did a

242
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,138
bit of

243
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,944
research after about... maybe 10
years in the police. Now

244
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,749
probably

245
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,299
about 10 years. I was there for
12 years all together. And a

246
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,870
couple of years before I left it
sort of research that to do it.

247
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,389
And around that time was when,
um, bootcamps were springing up

248
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,870
everywhere. And I thought, yeah,
actually this looks like a nice

249
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,999
defined route. And also I'm the
type of learner who likes to

250
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,128
turn

251
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,549
up to a class and sit down and
learn and then go home. I'm not

252
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,549
really that good at the whole
distance learning thing, self

253
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,659
learning. So I decided to enroll
on a big cap, which happily

254
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,774
coincided with the fact that the
police were looking to lay

255
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,889
people

256
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,749
off in my team or lay some of
the roles off. And they were

257
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,609
very

258
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,824
kind about actually, they said,
you know, if you want to go

259
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,038
then,

260
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,064
um, then that's fine. You can
go. And because the police has

261
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:45,058
quite

262
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,259
a nice defined plan for if
they're laying people off,

263
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,230
because I've been there for 12
years, then I got quite a nice

264
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,582
severance, which I was very
lucky to have, which then gave

265
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,934
me a bit

266
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,049
of a cushion to decide what I
wanted to do next. So after I

267
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,164
did

268
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,804
the big cabin and left the
police, I kind of thought

269
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,919
actually, I don't really want to
be a coder full time. I just

270
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,003
want

271
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:11,365
to take my time and see what's
out there. So while I've been

272
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,965
researching and around the time
that I kind of got into the, um,

273
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,519
bootcamp, I was getting more
involved in local meetups. And

274
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,443
at

275
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,543
the time there weren't that
many, so that was probably

276
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,643
around 2014,

277
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:28,413
2015 ish. Um, so yeah, there
weren't that many boot camps

278
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,173
around that time. Sorry, there
weren't too many meetups around

279
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,565
that time. So I joined the ones
that I could find. I just kind

280
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:33,957
of

281
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,048
met people there because I had a
marketing background eventually

282
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,708
started to help to organize one,
which kind of took me back to my

283
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,278
roots of organizing the computer
club at school. And also when I

284
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,018
was at the police, um,
organizing the association for

285
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,758
senior women

286
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,969
in a police as well. So kind of
always had that community

287
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:55,918
interest. And, um, so yeah. Then
when I left the police and I had

288
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,596
that little sort of cushion and
a little bit of time to think

289
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,234
about

290
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,604
what I wanted to do. Just sort
of continued with the whole

291
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:05,271
community building piece, um,
blogging. Um, just, just bits

292
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,938
and

293
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:12,389
pieces of different freelance
stuff that seemed to come my way

294
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,579
up. I think I've been quite
lucky in that respect, um, that

295
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,769
people

296
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,043
have seen what I can do. And
they've approached me most of

297
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,317
the

298
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:23,639
time to say you will you do this
for us? And then, um, so I

299
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,839
currently work at Redis their
developer community manager. And

300
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,708
they actually had hunted me they
could see what I was doing. And

301
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,313
they said, um, you know, we've
got this open role come and

302
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,918
apply

303
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,268
for it. We really want you to
apply. So I applied for that.

304
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:37,618
And

305
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,759
of course, like, you know, there
were other folks there in the

306
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,869
mix

307
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,629
as well, who had also applied,
yeah, it made it all the way

308
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,178
through the recruitment process
and got offered job at the end.

309
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,373
So there for about two months
now. Um, so yeah, it's been

310
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:51,568
quite

311
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:54,148
nice because it's a good combo
of what I started off doing in

312
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,728
my

313
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:00,749
career, which was the marketing
communications. And also,

314
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,453
combines in all the experience
that I got with organizing the

315
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:08,384
communities and stuff, but also
with like the software thing as

316
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:11,114
well. So it feels like it's a
really good combo of all the

317
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:12,539
things that I because any job
that you get, you're not going

318
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,964
to

319
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,179
enjoy all of it. So it feels
like I've taken all the bits of

320
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:16,394
all

321
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:18,913
the jobs that I've had, that I
enjoyed and fit them together to

322
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:21,298
create this job. yeah, that's
how I got to where I am

323
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:23,683
currently.

324
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:28,469
Bekah: Oh, so awesome. I love
that this feels like such a good

325
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,369
fit for you. It's I mean, it
definitely sounds like it. And

326
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,269
as

327
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:37,323
I was going through and kind of
preparing for today's podcast. I

328
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,553
was trying to think of this word
and it's somebody that does a

329
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,773
lot

330
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:46,214
of things and is talented at all
of those things. Right. And so I

331
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:49,183
didn't find the right word, but
I did find there's this word

332
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:54,214
polymath, means having learned
much. A person whose expertise

333
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:57,333
spans a significant number of
different subject areas. I was

334
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,384
like, okay. Yeah, that that's
exactly who you are. And I think

335
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:05,073
even if you go on to your blog
and check it out, there are so

336
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:08,313
many things, you know, you're
cooking, you're sewing, you're

337
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:11,553
writing about code. You're
talking, writing about giving

338
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:14,930
talks. So I especially feel like
that's refreshing because so

339
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,307
many

340
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:22,629
people are the personal branding
is a big thing right now. Right?

341
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:27,099
And so much a personal branding
is an over-simplification of who

342
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:30,698
you are, and it allows you to
have one focus about the things

343
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,999
that you want to talk about. and
it doesn't allow us to kind of

344
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:40,244
present our full selves in the
conversation. And so just really

345
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:46,423
love that you present all of the
things that you're interested in

346
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,803
talking about and, and pursuing,
and, you know, I I'd love to

347
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:54,104
know, you know, your take on
personal branding or like what

348
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:57,494
kind of makes you feel like,
yeah, I'm just going to talk

349
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:58,504
about all the things I like.

350
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,255
Suze: Yeah, that's an
interesting question. And you,

351
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,707
you do hear a

352
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,328
lot about personal branding,
especially if you are in tech

353
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,948
and

354
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:09,844
especially if you're on tech,
Twitter, um, It's really hard. I

355
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,844
think being in the tech industry
is hard anyway, without this

356
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:15,714
added thing of like, you've got
to make a personal brand. And I

357
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,669
remember when I was coming out
of bootcamp, the, um, the

358
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,624
careers

359
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,393
coach did say you need to have
consistent branding, but what

360
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,162
she

361
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:26,073
meant there was visual. So, you
know, make a business card, make

362
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,114
your CV, make your website and
make sure that the branding is

363
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,053
consistent and then sits there.
You know, they took more about

364
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:36,043
personal branding. And I think
that you can only really have. A

365
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:39,193
good personal brand, if you do
include all those other things,

366
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,903
because if you don't, if you
just say right, I'm a, I don't

367
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:42,613
know,

368
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:45,464
I'm a JavaScript developer.
That's not really a personal

369
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,823
brand, is it because what makes
you unique? All of those things

370
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:51,124
that you said, like, you know,
do you like sewing? Do you like

371
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,803
cooking? Do you like running? Do
you like cats? That's what makes

372
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:58,063
you, you isn't it. And that's
your personal brand. And you

373
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,263
know, this is how you write,
this is how you speak or maybe

374
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,463
you

375
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:05,114
choose not to blog. Maybe choose
not to speak. Um, but yeah, I

376
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:09,193
think that there is a lot of
pressure around making sure that

377
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:13,124
you've got a personal brand. I
dunno. I don't think that I

378
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:18,104
necessarily curated mine. Like
you say, I try to be quite

379
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,903
authentic and you know, if
people don't like my hobbies,

380
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,702
then I

381
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,433
don't really care because they
can get their own hobbies

382
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,884
company. Um, but yeah, I think
it's, it's just interesting to

383
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:33,223
read about other people as well
as see what makes them tick. So,

384
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:36,134
yeah, we're all different. And I
think it's up to you as to how

385
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:39,253
much of yourself you put out
there. And that's the other side

386
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,683
of personal branding, isn't it?
That there is a lot of pressure

387
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:45,148
to put yourself out there. And I
always say to people. You know,

388
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,108
they come to me and they say,
oh, you know, you did a lot of

389
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,068
public

390
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:50,729
speaking do this and that. Like,
I, I, don't know if it's for me.

391
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,748
And I'm like, well, you know,
don't feel the pressure to do

392
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:52,708
it,

393
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,803
because for some people, like
I've seen them physically

394
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,548
shaking

395
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,438
when they had to get up and do a
talk and I'm like, you know,

396
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:00,328
find

397
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:02,969
something that you feel
comfortable doing. Don't feel

398
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,699
like you have to go and do talks
and stuff because everyone else

399
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:09,118
is doing it. There's got to be
other ways of showing what you

400
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:13,009
can do. Like maybe you can write
something or can just build

401
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,574
something you don't, maybe don't
even have to write and speak.

402
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:18,794
Maybe you can just build
something and show your talents

403
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:24,554
through that. Um, so yeah, I
dunno, it's a big topic and, uh,

404
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:27,763
I'm not really too sure the
answer is. I often wonder if the

405
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:31,483
people with the big personal
brands are truly happy and how

406
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:36,584
much time they spend on, uh, on
nurturing that brand and keeping

407
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,864
it up because does feel like
some of these folks are on

408
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,144
Twitter all

409
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,983
day, every day. And it's like
how, I can't think of that many

410
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,314
things to tweet. have you got
time to do your day job? It's

411
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:49,304
really weird.

412
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,229
Bekah: Yeah.

413
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:53,513
Dan: I have that same thing too.
I'm lucky if I get one or two

414
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:57,804
tweets. you know what it also
happened. I'll try, I think of

415
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,523
something and then edit it over
and over again.

416
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:01,719
Suze: Oh, yeah.

417
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,509
Dan: and then just close the
window

418
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,298
Suze: Yeah, exactly. If you
overthink it, you buy, I do that

419
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,739
all the time. Yeah.

420
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,773
Dan: are never, yeah. The ones
that go through that process are

421
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,943
never a good, good anyway, but
yeah, that's um, actually,

422
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:15,894
honestly, I was coming in the
office this morning and thinking

423
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:18,191
almost that exact same advice
about. There is a lot of

424
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,248
pressure

425
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,663
to do, um, a lot of this stuff
or, you know, anything, even

426
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:25,077
the,

427
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,568
the there's the, the build in
public, you know, movement. And

428
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:30,778
there's a, all, all my, um,
asking me almost always good

429
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,848
intentions behind all of the
advice. You know, people are

430
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,023
pretty much talking about what
worked for them But I love that

431
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,834
you said like, please, like
don't, you know, if likes public

432
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,503
speaking is very, very hard for
you or horrible, you know, just

433
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:47,054
don't like find, you can find
something else. There's lots of

434
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:47,683
other things to do.

435
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:48,679
Suze: Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,753
Dan: I appreciate like that
advice people can use to hear

437
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:53,923
that that's good stuff.

438
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,614
Bekah: Yeah. And I think we're
looking at your career too,

439
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,614
you've tried a lot of different
things. Um, have a lot of

440
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:03,156
different interests. Oh, my gosh
interest is I need more coffee,

441
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:05,698
I

442
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:10,828
guess, but one of the things I
see consistently is your work

443
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,808
with communities. And you first
started coming to Virtual

444
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,788
Coffee,

445
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,263
you became a breakout room
leader really quickly. Um, it's

446
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,738
just

447
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,124
because I wasn't in your room.
think I've only been in your

448
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,509
room

449
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,898
once because you became a room
leader so quickly and I'm most

450
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:33,118
often a room leader, but it was
it's consistently, um, commented

451
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:37,138
on what a great room leader you
are. And in everyone's always

452
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,001
like, oh, if I could be in a
room, I would be in her room.

453
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,864
And

454
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,564
so, you know, you've been an
emcee for events and other

455
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:45,064
things. And I just wanted to
see, like, is there an approach

456
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,564
that

457
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:50,523
you have as you go into this and
you lead these small group

458
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:52,128
conversations, or maybe you can
just kind of like walk us

459
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,733
through

460
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,294
your thought process as you're a
breakout room or being an MC for

461
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,663
an event that helps people feel
welcome.

462
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:05,318
Suze: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's a
really great question. And, um,

463
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:10,118
yeah, it's true. I did become a
room leader very early on and I

464
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,143
thank Dan for that. Actually,
Dan invited me to, because I

465
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:14,168
remember

466
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,638
the turning point. Do you
remember that?

467
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:19,574
Dan: I am almost interjected to
steal credit for that, because I

468
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:20,933
don't remember what we talked
about. You and I had a

469
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,163
one-on-one

470
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:24,263
conversation or something. And
then I was like, oh, we just

471
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,363
need

472
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:27,743
to get in here. Which is,

473
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,209
Suze: Yeah. Yeah. What it was
was you were room-leading that

474
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,084
day,

475
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,393
but I think you had a really bad
night and yeah. You were

476
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,672
properly

477
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:40,364
struggling. And I was like, oh,
okay. So I didn't, I don't think

478
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:42,298
I consciously led the room, but
yeah. I was like, oh, I thought

479
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,232
I

480
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,743
had dan looks like. We're going
to fall asleep. So let's see if

481
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:51,163
we can take the pressure off.
Yeah, it was, yeah, it was, it

482
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:54,374
was you weren't well that day at
all, but, uh, that's the thing.

483
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:58,903
We often commit to do something
and, uh, and then find out that

484
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,538
actually today's not the day.
So, uh, yeah, so also that we

485
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,173
were

486
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:05,324
like, okay, let's, let's do this
thing. So, um, yeah, I think it

487
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,374
all comes down to. Empathy and
knowing your audience. And this

488
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:12,223
is something that I learned like
really early on doing marketing,

489
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:14,294
because if you want to do
marketing, you have to know your

490
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,003
audience. Otherwise you're not
going to be very good at

491
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:20,534
marketing. And so being in
Virtual Coffee, I think I

492
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:23,894
probably maybe came to four,
three or four before I became a

493
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:29,864
room leader. And so it was very
fresh in my mind, what it felt

494
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,964
like to be new to Virtual
Coffee. So I tried to kind of

495
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:34,064
incorporate

496
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:36,974
that in, um, And so something
that I always ask when I get

497
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:39,884
into

498
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:43,423
the room and I'm rim leading is,
do I have anyone new to Virtual

499
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:46,364
Coffee here with me today? And
then I'm like, look, don't be

500
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,824
scared. Like just put your hands
up. It's fine. We're not all

501
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:50,459
going to judge you. I just want
to make sure that I'm not

502
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,094
missing

503
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:55,739
out any information that, you
know, I need to know. And then I

504
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,929
might go over a few bits that
you've already gone through in

505
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,714
the big breakout room in the
main room. But I feel like in

506
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,499
the main

507
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:04,048
room, sometimes there's just so
much going on that maybe they're

508
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,628
not taking it all in. So it's
just easier in a smaller group.

509
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,328
And then just put them at ease
because they're gonna have to

510
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:12,719
introduce themselves anyway. So,
you know, so they can kind of be

511
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,229
in the spotlight.

512
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:14,213
Bekah: Yeah.

513
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:20,398
Suze: Um, and then I also try to
make sure that there's a balance

514
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,834
of topics and also balance of
people speaking. So I always,

515
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,209
um,

516
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,196
asked for all the topics
upfront. And then say, right,

517
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:31,123
I'm going to

518
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:34,064
try and split the time equally
between all of these topics so

519
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,273
that folks can all kind of get
their questions answered and

520
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,938
stuff like that. And then I'm
not afraid to call it, say,

521
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:40,603
we've

522
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:42,028
done 20 minutes on the topic.
I'm not afraid to say right. I'm

523
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,452
just

524
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,226
going to take the last point
here from Dan. And then we're

525
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,999
going to

526
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,098
move on to the next topic,
because I've already said at the

527
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:50,688
beginning, we've got these
three, so everybody knows we're

528
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:52,278
going to

529
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,943
have to move on at some point.
So they can, they can't be too

530
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,608
upset

531
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,939
when we actually do move on.
Whereas I guess if he didn't do

532
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,249
that, and then we pivoted
somebody might be like, oh, hang

533
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:04,548
on a minute. I didn't quite
finish what I wanted to say. Um,

534
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:08,238
and then, um, when people speak,
I do a lot of active listening

535
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,088
as

536
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:14,986
well and make sure that I kind
of highlight back to everybody,

537
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,884
the

538
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:21,614
bits that kind of resonated with
me, which are going to be

539
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:25,304
different for everyone, but at
least I think it's important to

540
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,133
people to feel heard, isn't it.
So what better way of making

541
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,422
them

542
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:30,928
feel heard than repeating back
what you heard? So, and that

543
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,433
also

544
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,713
gives people a chance to then
think, oh yeah, actually, you

545
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:38,233
know, I've thought of something
else or whatever, it kind of

546
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:42,868
stimulates conversation, but
sometimes. If you feel like, um,

547
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:46,199
it's kind of dying off a bit,
just doing that little summary

548
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:49,169
piece gets people thinking, and
it gives them a bit of time to

549
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,039
think about, what comes next and
stuff. Um, yeah, so those are

550
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,909
the

551
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:01,469
main things I just try and
include people really...um, I

552
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,419
think that's the main thing,
because being an introvert

553
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:06,778
myself, know that when I'm in a
group, especially when I don't

554
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:11,199
know people, it can be really
hard to get a word in edgewise.

555
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,073
Yeah. um, oh, and the other
thing I always do is I make sure

556
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,887
that

557
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:19,394
we use raise hands in all of my
rooms. I don't, I don't allow

558
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,354
anyone to just unmute and, uh,
and speak because the people who

559
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,693
do that are going to be the ones
that are confident to do that.

560
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:26,818
And the people that don't do
that, aren't going to be the

561
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:27,733
ones

562
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:28,798
that aren't confident to do
that. And then you won't ever

563
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:29,863
hear from

564
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,558
them. So I always say, please
use the raise hand function. And

565
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:33,252
then

566
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:34,768
that helps me to see like how
many people are in the queue.

567
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:36,283
And

568
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,068
I've got five minutes left until
I need to pivot. So. Ask them to

569
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,229
be brief and stuff. It just kind
of helps me with the whole

570
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:46,788
management of the room. So yeah,
I do try and build in a few

571
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:48,423
different things to help the
more introverted people, because

572
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,058
I

573
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:54,828
know what that's like and you
kind of feel like, I can't get a

574
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,028
word and then you just give up
and I don't really want people

575
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:57,228
to

576
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,449
do that because there's a reason
why they came and the reason why

577
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:02,269
they came wasn't really to sit
there, listening to everybody

578
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,509
else, but really they wanted to
speak didn't they, and either

579
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,909
they didn't manage it this time
and that's really what I want to

580
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:08,368
avoid.

581
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,574
Dan: I love all of that. I love
hearing about it, your process,

582
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:18,124
you know, it's something that
I've personally just really

583
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:20,493
started thinking about since
Virtual, you know, over the last

584
00:26:20,523 --> 00:26:26,894
year or so. Somebody with your
experience, you know, with the

585
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:30,614
community building and, um, you
know, things like that. It's

586
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:33,523
really nice to hear that I like
the active listening, active

587
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:36,913
listening, you know, I'm glad,
I'm glad that I can ask you this

588
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:40,064
question because it's is a cool,
um, is as cool as see how much

589
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:43,183
actually goes into being a room
leader. When, when you know room

590
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:45,493
leader, most of the time isn't
going to be talking it, like

591
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:48,554
isn't talking that much through,
through, through an hour long

592
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:52,949
conversation. Um, but still. Uh,
doing a lot. I like how you

593
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,689
illustrate it, like how much,
uh, you know, so that somebody

594
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,429
can

595
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:00,058
improve, help, improve a room
and, and help people get hurt,

596
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,878
you know? And that's that, was
the other part of what I liked

597
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:05,008
was the, how the active
listening is, you know, is a

598
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,107
form of

599
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:09,328
managing the conversation, but
also like acknowledging that a

600
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:14,233
person got heard, you know,
that's phrased was not put that

601
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:17,953
together very well, that
sentence, but, you know, th that

602
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:21,233
was the, you ended with like,
that's why people are coming is

603
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,104
to maybe to, you know, connect
and, and part of connecting is

604
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:25,933
actually being heard as far as
well as, uh, you know,

605
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,762
listening,

606
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,653
I suppose, that makes any sense
at all.

607
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,253
Suze: Definitely. It's
definitely a conversation is

608
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,347
always a

609
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:34,209
two-way thing. Is there
communication's a two-way

610
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,523
process. So, um, yeah, it's not
just about talking at somebody

611
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:38,837
at

612
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:43,259
all. So yeah, I do try and get a
bit of a, a bit of a balance in

613
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,328
there, but you know, that's not
to say, you know, I know there's

614
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,558
a lot of folks who've tried the
room leading and then you were

615
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:47,788
it

616
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:51,028
and there is a lot to remember.
So just don't feel any pressure

617
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:52,828
to do all of those things, but
just be conscious that you're

618
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,628
not

619
00:27:54,628 --> 00:27:56,193
just sitting there to be a
person that's calling out names

620
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,758
I

621
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,828
guess... maybe, um and we were
just trying to incorporate one

622
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,897
or

623
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,413
two little tactics in there, but
at the end of the day, we're

624
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,928
just

625
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,204
grateful for anyone who steps up
to do that role, because it's

626
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,479
not

627
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,348
an easy one is it?

628
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:09,753
Bekah: Yeah.

629
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:10,199
Dan: Yeah.

630
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,378
Bekah: Uh, it's, are so many
little things like you were

631
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:16,499
saying, and we want everybody to
be comfortable and feel welcome.

632
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,608
Right? And so allowing space for
them to do that and creating

633
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,509
different pathways for them to
communicate by giving time with

634
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,959
the hand raise function, or
allowing a little bit of silence

635
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:31,979
for someone to jump in or to use
the chat and bring that forward

636
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,334
is, you know, really important
to forming those relationships.

637
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,689
And

638
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:41,519
I think. Active listening is, is
a skill that can be that's

639
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,588
learned really, I think because
we all like to talk about things

640
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:49,739
that we're excited about and,
you know, sometimes it's hard,

641
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,338
sometimes room leaders continue
to talk about things. You know,

642
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,249
I've been known to go on a hot
take rant every once in a while.

643
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:01,499
Um, but by keeping those things
in mind and recognizing, okay,

644
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:07,108
I've been talking for awhile. I
need to figure out how to bring

645
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:08,623
other people into this
conversation. If there aren't

646
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,108
any

647
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,798
hand raises or this person in my
room was very excited, but

648
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,103
they've been talking for five
minutes straight without taking

649
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,408
a

650
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:18,809
breath. I need to make sure that
there's space for everybody to

651
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,209
be

652
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:25,423
part of the conversation. And
that's why we keep the. Small

653
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,898
like between eight and 10
people, ideally, because it does

654
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,373
allow

655
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:34,334
room for that. And I think that
are lots of helpful tips for

656
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:37,874
people who are room leaders, but
also for people who are, are in

657
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:42,163
the room or in a group
conversation, or, know, sitting

658
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:45,614
at a conference table with a
bunch of people you don't know

659
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,753
can be a challenge. But I think
that, know, it's all towards

660
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:53,574
building an inclusive community
by keeping those things in mind.

661
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,763
Suze: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

662
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,583
Dan: I'm glad we got into this
too, because I, you know, I

663
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,588
don't

664
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:02,439
know how many listeners we have
that are not Virtual Coffee

665
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:07,088
members. Um, but you know, this
is like one of the main things

666
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:10,568
that we do in Virtual Coffee and
all of our room leaders are all,

667
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:12,998
you know, sort of volunteers
that we, either volunteer to, or

668
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:15,398
we

669
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:19,388
pulled into helping manage these
rooms. And, um, I just wanted to

670
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:20,858
like take a quick moment to
shout out everybody. mean, Suze

671
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:22,328
and

672
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:24,273
everybody else, because I don't
know how many people are. In

673
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:26,218
that

674
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,558
we, you know, we have a group of
people that we pull from, but,

675
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,798
uh, they're all awesome. And
they're all volunteers and it's,

676
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:33,568
it's like, this is a good
illustration of like that th

677
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,298
that

678
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:37,528
it takes work and it takes
effort, you know, just, just to

679
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:39,028
do those. And we, you know, we
appreciate everybody

680
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:40,528
appreciates.

681
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,628
It these rooms B uh, B

682
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,209
Suze: Sometimes it takes getting
over a bit of fear as well. I

683
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,548
know there's some people that
have tried to do it and they've

684
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:51,358
really kind of had to psych
themselves up to do it. So not

685
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:52,633
everybody can just jump in and
do it. And I really take my hat

686
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,908
off

687
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:54,628
to them as well.

688
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,223
Dan: Yeah.

689
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,638
Bekah: absolutely. It is. It's a
process and it's not for

690
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:02,878
everybody, but also something
that you can work on and we try

691
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:06,749
and provide support for a new
room leaders and, um, to

692
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:09,838
transition into. Full-time room
leaders. I don't know what to

693
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:12,298
call they want to, but you know,
like you said, there can be a

694
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:14,758
lot

695
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,388
of challenges along the way.
Yeah. that that's one of the

696
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:20,413
things that I think is really
interesting about your story

697
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,438
too.

698
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:26,068
Like you, I think are
consistently taking on new

699
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:30,659
challenges. It feels like, you
know, you're, changing career

700
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,748
paths or you're writing a book
or you're streaming on Twitch.

701
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,837
so

702
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:40,078
you're consistently pursuing all
of these new and challenging

703
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:42,328
things. And I just want, why.

704
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:49,429
Suze: I don't know. Um, it's
funny. Yeah. Why? Well, um, that

705
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,999
is, that is the big question. I
don't know. And I'm really glad

706
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:56,209
you said that. So thank you for
saying that because I think it's

707
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,929
really hard. And actually like,
especially through the pandemic,

708
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,898
I've really kind of struggled
with my mental health quite a

709
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,568
lot. And there have been points
where I'm just kind of thinking

710
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:10,304
like, You know, my achievements
aren't really anything and what

711
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:14,653
am I doing? And you know, what
do I do next type thing. So it's

712
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:17,324
really nice for you to
acknowledge that. And it does

713
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:20,624
make me feel a bit better than
that. I actually, uh, I am

714
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:23,534
actually doing something even
when it feels like I'm not, but,

715
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:28,394
um, yeah, I guess. I dunno, I
guess I'm just curious about

716
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,043
stuff. I just see people doing
it like this Twitch thing, and

717
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,692
I'm

718
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:34,874
like, oh, what's that all about
then? How does that work? And

719
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:39,673
then what can you do with it?
And I think I also like to be

720
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:44,564
different as well. So I want to
try something that other people

721
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:50,564
aren't trying or other dev teams
aren't trying, or maybe the same

722
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:56,023
thing, but in a different way.
Um, or just try, try something

723
00:32:56,023 --> 00:32:59,653
for the first time somewhere. I
don't know, or just take a

724
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:03,253
different slump on it, but I try
to do things in an organized way

725
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:06,314
as well, because I'm always
thinking about why am I doing

726
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:09,074
this? Like, what's the point of
doing it? And I think that helps

727
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:13,673
quite a lot. I'm not really a
random person. I don't I don't

728
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:16,753
really like random. I like to do
things in quite a strategic and

729
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:20,923
planned way. So yeah, while it
might seem like I do a lot of

730
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:25,078
different things, I probably did
over think all of those things a

731
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:31,348
lot before I actually jumped in.
Um, so, uh, yeah. Yeah, I think

732
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,178
that's, I think that's what it
is, the curiosity and the

733
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,008
wanting

734
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,328
to do something different and
you know, what tools can I use

735
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:37,647
to do

736
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,009
that?

737
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,804
Dan: So you're streaming on
Twitch, you know, sort of

738
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,903
recently is that that's for
work, right? Um, is that true?

739
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,002
All

740
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,433
right. Um, um, not totally
remembering, but.

741
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:53,848
Suze: Yeah. So yeah, the
streaming or Twitch is very

742
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,419
recent. And like the other thing
about me is like, I kind of go

743
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,259
big or go home. So I think they
think gradually I don't do a

744
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,398
small thing. I'll be like,
right, I'm going to go on

745
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:03,537
Twitch. So

746
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,803
this month is the first time
I've ever twitched. And by the

747
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:08,068
end of

748
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:10,761
October, I will have done nine
at least. There's nine in the

749
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:13,454
diary.

750
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:18,043
Yeah. So I, so, okay. So when I
decided I was going to apply for

751
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:20,954
this job during the recruitment
process, I said to my boss, you,

752
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:23,324
they hear some projects that I
would really love to do if I get

753
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:28,434
the job. And one of them was,
they Redis, we have, um, Redis

754
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:31,994
university got eight free
training courses. And I said,

755
00:34:31,994 --> 00:34:35,699
right. Okay. Lets o RU 101 I'll
take RU101 as part of my

756
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,659
onboarding and I'll learn in
public. Um, so I'll stream that.

757
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,504
And so I'm streaming that with
one of my colleagues who works

758
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:42,869
in

759
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,778
the Redis university world and
the we're going through all the

760
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:47,998
different classes together and
stuff like that. And he's

761
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:49,978
teaching me, so that's my
regular one every week. And the

762
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,958
other

763
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,403
project that I pitched to my.
Um, at the time, hopefully

764
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:56,848
potential

765
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,489
boss, but now he's, my boss was
hacktoberfest. So, um, yeah,

766
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,309
Redis has got its roots in open
source and I thought, you know,

767
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:09,458
this is a really good fit and
Redis, hasn't done hacktoberfest

768
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:13,409
before. So let's look at putting
some of our stuff out for folks

769
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,878
to get involved with and
contribute to because you know,

770
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:19,759
I've Participated in
Hacktoberfest before for the

771
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,159
benefit of everybody listening,
I'm just holding up my t-shirt

772
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,378
that I'm wearing. And this poor
t-shirt is stretched. Cause I

773
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:26,958
keep holding it up on the, on
the strings. Um, so yeah, I was

774
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,538
like,

775
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:33,949
let's do Hacktoberfest. Like how
hard can it be? Really? And

776
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:35,929
actually it wasn't that hard,
like, cause I was really

777
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,203
organized about it and um,
talked to a few people across

778
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,477
the

779
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:41,068
business about, you know which
we realistically include here?

780
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:44,938
issues can we put out? And we've
had a really good response. So.

781
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:50,094
With that. What I did was also
the docs team at work. We're

782
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,998
really lucky. We've got docs T
in the Dev rel team with us. So

783
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,902
it's

784
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,213
all like this nice place where
we can just go directly to them.

785
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:58,523
I

786
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,203
don't have to go into another
unit and ask and stuff. I said

787
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,883
to

788
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:06,204
them, documentation is often
cited as a way for folks to get

789
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:10,344
their feet wet with openings
source. And all hacktoberfest So

790
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:14,634
let's live streams is where we
demystify technical writing and

791
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:17,903
documentation for people that
will want to get involved in

792
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:19,583
that. You know, there's a lot of
coders that want to get into

793
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,523
technical writing. There's a lot
of people that don't code, but

794
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:25,253
they're interested in writing
who were interested in doing

795
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:27,653
technical writing cause they
don't want to code, which is

796
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,696
fine. Um, Th those people on my
teams, who've got three

797
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:31,739
technical

798
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:32,969
writers. One of them was a
coder, one of them wasn't. So

799
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:34,199
that was

800
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:38,909
really good. So, um, I've done a
panel, um, chat with them last

801
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:42,768
Friday. So that's on YouTube now
and next week hunting one to one

802
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:46,409
file size for each one of them.
So that's another three streams.

803
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,509
Um, and this morning, yeah, this
morning, me and the dev rel

804
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:54,983
manager, the developer advocacy
manager a live stream at 9:00 AM

805
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:57,173
this morning, which was fun
actually, because we both in the

806
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,733
UK. Normally we do it at 5:00 PM
because that's the time that

807
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,293
hits

808
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:03,983
like Pacific, Eastern and a lot
of other places, but we thought,

809
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,293
okay, let's do the 9:00 AM slot
and just see what happens. Um,

810
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,603
so

811
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:12,864
we went through, um, you know,
let's have a look at the issues

812
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,544
that we've put out and let's
have a look at the PRs. We've

813
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,224
got

814
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:18,684
back. Cause some of them were
really amazing. And like I said,

815
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:21,083
at the beginning, didn't know
what we were going to get back.

816
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,358
Like we put out a load of
issues. We didn't know how well

817
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:23,633
they were

818
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,088
going to be received. You know,
how hard can it be? But we got

819
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:26,542
so

820
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,333
many great contributions from
people. Some of whom had never

821
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,043
used the product before. And
this was really kind of a

822
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:32,753
Testament to

823
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:35,048
how good the readmes were that
people had put on the repose.

824
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:37,343
But

825
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:39,623
back when they created the
projects, not even just for

826
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:43,393
hacktoberfest. We were really
like thinking like everybody,

827
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:48,893
everbody's past selves for being
kind to us there. And, um, so

828
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,248
yeah, this is, this is how I
kind of got into streaming. I'm

829
00:37:51,248 --> 00:37:53,603
not

830
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:56,664
sure whether it's my favorite
thing to do. I think it's a

831
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:58,014
really hard grind actually. And
it depends why you want to do

832
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,364
it.

833
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,954
If you're doing it to get
followers, you probably going to

834
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:02,476
do be doing it for a while.
Maybe just doing it because you

835
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:03,998
like

836
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:05,503
streaming then fine. But I think
there's always a part of you

837
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:06,997
that

838
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,889
wants somebody to be watching
because otherwise, why would you

839
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:09,789
sit there doing it?

840
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,084
Bekah: It's less scary. If
there's nobody watching, then

841
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,114
you

842
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:17,574
can say, well, I tried it, you
know,

843
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,158
Suze: Nobody came so I'm not
gonna do it anymore, but yeah,

844
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:20,108
we

845
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:22,568
recording all ours and putting
them on YouTube and we getting a

846
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,628
decent, uh, views of the
recording. So that's something.

847
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:29,103
Bekah: Are those all in the
Redis lab twitch account?

848
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,918
Suze: Yes. Yeah. I can give you
the link. Yeah.

849
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,744
Bekah: Got it. It'll be in the
show notes.

850
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:35,648
Suze: Yeah.

851
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:39,164
Dan: That's fun. Yeah. And the,
the, the fact that it's easy to

852
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:43,094
put those recordings on YouTube
is as fun it's, it's becomes

853
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:46,704
like, even if you, and if you
just keep going you'll end up

854
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:49,313
with followers, I think, you
know, but like on Twitch, but,

855
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,743
um, it's a nice way to record,
um, with some lower

856
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,142
expectations,

857
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:56,813
you know, so if you drop onto a
YouTube link that says, here's

858
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:59,213
the stream recording from
whatever, then people are going

859
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,153
to expect a stream level. You
know, like not highly edited,

860
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,093
not

861
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:04,504
like highly produced, but a nice
stream. And you know, so that

862
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:05,914
the

863
00:39:05,914 --> 00:39:08,704
expectations are like set, you
know what I mean? And so that's

864
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:13,954
one reason. That's one, one side
of that. I like streaming, you

865
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:17,943
know, for coding stuff, because
if I made a typo, you know,

866
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,383
whatever I had to hit delete
and, you know, whatever in a, in

867
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,823
a

868
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:23,463
recorded video that I was like
producing, I would have to edit

869
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,858
it out and do a scene or
whatever rerecord it. But if

870
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,253
it's not a

871
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,603
stream, like, you know,
everybody makes typos, it's not

872
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:28,953
a big deal,

873
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:31,970
you know? So, um, That's like
the Twitch to YouTube pipeline

874
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,957
aspect

875
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,838
of it. I, I feel like is, uh, is
nice. I don't know.

876
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,483
Suze: Yeah, no, you're
definitely right about that

877
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:40,727
authenticity

878
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:43,338
thing. If people want to see
what you're really like, they'll

879
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,949
either they need to watch you on
a live stream and they get the

880
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,559
warts and all don't. They like
the first livestream that I did

881
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:51,378
accidentally expose my password,
which is like a bit of a Rite of

882
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:52,818
passage for any new streamers.

883
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:54,389
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That'll happen.

884
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:56,748
Suze: Um,

885
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:59,139
Dan: like watching a recording
of a, of a concert or something

886
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,969
as

887
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,398
opposed to a music video, you
know, it's like,

888
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,103
Bekah: And it's the same thing I
think that goes for, there are

889
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,453
so

890
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,149
many online conferences, right.
And everybody complains. It's

891
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:09,844
not

892
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:14,123
the same energy, but that's
because they're not creating a

893
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:16,224
new space for that thing. So
many of them are prerecorded and

894
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:18,309
you

895
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:20,049
don't get energy from that. At
least I don't. It sucks. It

896
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,789
sucks

897
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:23,843
the energy out of me because I
know I can, Yeah. I can edit

898
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:25,897
that

899
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,533
thing or I have to nail it
because it's, recorded and

900
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,168
that's

901
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:32,079
an expectation, but if you're at
a conference and you're giving a

902
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,539
live talk, you're not, that's a
totally different energy. And I

903
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:41,978
think. You know, maybe there's a
middle ground between just going

904
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:43,973
into a livestream without any
preparation and having a

905
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,968
produced

906
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:48,998
YouTube video and that's where
the online conference space

907
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,743
should live. Like be able to
give your talk, um, while

908
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,488
livestreamed

909
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:57,408
and. Um, it's harder because you
can't see people, but when

910
00:40:57,408 --> 00:41:00,268
you're

911
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,653
navigating the chat that goes on
a Twitch stream or whatever,

912
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,948
that

913
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:08,338
becomes part of the interaction
and there shouldn't be that

914
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:10,318
expectation that this is going
to be like an in-person

915
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,298
conference

916
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,008
talk because it's not an
in-person conference talk,

917
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,718
right.

918
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,748
There should be a shift in how
we find our energy online.

919
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:24,759
Suze: Yeah. Yeah. And that whole
finding your energy online thing

920
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:27,938
is the age old question. Isn't
it? We kind of rapidly had to

921
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:29,858
desperately find some energy
from somewhere when everything

922
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:31,418
went

923
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:34,599
online and some conferences are
better than others. I definitely

924
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,378
like the ones where they have
like networking and stuff, and

925
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:40,335
that can be scary for people.
Um, but yeah, those ones are the

926
00:41:40,335 --> 00:41:42,292
ones

927
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,688
that I probably enjoy the most.
And like you say, the ones that

928
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,083
I

929
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:48,293
enjoyed the least were the ones
where they were prerecorded and

930
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:49,959
like for the past sort of 18 to
24 months, I've done a mixture

931
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,594
of

932
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:55,434
both. So I've spoken at
conferences, online conferences

933
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,504
live and online conferences
where it's been pre recorded.

934
00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:59,574
And yet

935
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:03,094
pre recordings are energy
sucking aren't they?

936
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,663
Dan: Yeah, it's hard to, it's
hard to, and I agree. reason

937
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:08,002
that

938
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:09,593
it's happening right, is
everyone just tried to do

939
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,152
straight, you

940
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,914
know, live ones when it all
started. And that's really hard

941
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:15,744
too. And there's so many
technical challenges that can

942
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,393
come up, you know? And so I
think there was a whole year or

943
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:19,042
a few,

944
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:23,068
like half a year of conferences
that were all. Parts got messed

945
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:26,068
up and the organizers are like,
we're not doing this again, you

946
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:27,628
know? Uh, because they just
tried to do the same thing

947
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,188
except on

948
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,018
zoom, you know? And so swung way
around to the other side of

949
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:32,848
where

950
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,139
you're, you know, now you're
like a lot of prerecorded talks,

951
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,429
but

952
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:36,028
Suze: Yeah.

953
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:38,849
Dan: I think everybody agrees
that, um, Codeland did an

954
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,159
interesting thing where they had
a bunch of prerecorded recorded

955
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:47,068
talks, but they had like they,
there was like a of time of like

956
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:48,873
four talks It was just like,
they were just like streaming

957
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:50,678
the

958
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,838
recordings, you know? And so the
MCs would like drop in in

959
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:54,728
between, but, they also released
on demand links. And so you

960
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:56,618
could

961
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:58,268
just like shut off the stream
and go watch them or something

962
00:42:58,268 --> 00:42:59,917
if you

963
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:03,579
wanted, or, you know, like that.
Um, which was like kind of

964
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:04,748
interesting. Uh, you know, I
don't think it totally solved

965
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,917
the

966
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:06,429
problem, but

967
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:09,434
Suze: No, I don't think there,
there is an answer. Cause some

968
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:12,914
people don't even like in person
ones. So for some people they

969
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,313
really love the online. So yeah,
definitely can't please

970
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:15,712
everyone.

971
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,619
Dan: Well, yeah, that's, that's
all, that's always true.

972
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:19,608
Suze: Yeah.

973
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:22,913
Bekah: I think people too don't
realize how much speakers

974
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:25,252
prepare

975
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:30,699
for their talks and. When you go
to a conference, a lot of times

976
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:34,148
they'll pay for your travel or
they'll pay for your hotel stay

977
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:37,809
and you'll get, you know, some
kind of gift as part of that,

978
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,458
which is like a nice
recognition. You, you put a lot

979
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,958
of time into

980
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,983
this and we appreciate that. And
I think that there wasn't as

981
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:45,008
much

982
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:47,829
of that with online conferences,
because one, they didn't have

983
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:51,909
funding or sponsorships and two,
they were trying to figure out

984
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:56,318
how are they going to run three
tracks of this conference online

985
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,478
and in a lot of instances, the
speakers kind of got lost along

986
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:06,938
the way, in terms of just, just
simple thank yous is even, and,

987
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:09,718
and I, I understand it is hard
to organize events and make

988
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:12,377
changes

989
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,079
and stuff like that, it just
goes back to that. You know,

990
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,559
earlier

991
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,508
talking about those, there's a
lot of work and effort put into

992
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:21,457
a

993
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,783
lot of the things that we do
that are, um, audience facing

994
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,108
things.

995
00:44:26,923 --> 00:44:30,103
Suze: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
Cause people are quick to tell

996
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:32,603
you what they didn't like, but a
lot of the time they don't speak

997
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,673
a couple of say what they did
like do they, um, and also even

998
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,253
if you ask people some times,
like you did a survey,

999
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:43,423
historically I was in marketing
for ages. And I think the survey

1000
00:44:43,423 --> 00:44:46,673
completion rate was somewhere
between. Um, 5 and 15%, but

1001
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:50,289
normally around the 5% mark and
it still, it's no different

1002
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:53,438
today, really, unless you kind
of offer a nice incentive for

1003
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:55,989
somebody to fill that in. So
yeah, even when you directly ask

1004
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:58,163
people what they want, they
don't necessarily tell you. And

1005
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,337
yes,

1006
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:04,628
organizing an online event is it
is a different set of skills and

1007
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,579
knowledge. Uh, than, uh,
organizing an in-person one. And

1008
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,728
like you say it in in-person
ones kind of a bit easier, cause

1009
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:14,829
you're dealing with physical
rooms, aren't you? And you know,

1010
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:17,389
if you've got three tracks,
you've got like that room one is

1011
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:19,869
track, one room two is track two
and room three's track three

1012
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,488
easy. Just tell everyone which
room they've got to go to, but

1013
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:22,897
if

1014
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,869
you're using a technology
solution to manage your tracks,

1015
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,648
that can become a bit of a
nightmare very quickly. I think

1016
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:34,298
you probably need more staffing.
To manage something like that,

1017
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:36,909
but then you the safety issue.
Yeah.

1018
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:41,224
Bekah: Well, w when you're in a
room with somebody, can say, the

1019
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:42,718
speaker is not here. You can
physically find them. If

1020
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,192
somebody

1021
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:47,733
is not online at the right time,
more difficult.

1022
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:51,818
Dan: Yeah. And you're, you're
much more like at the whims of

1023
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:54,248
their local, you know, their own
computer and their own internet

1024
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:58,628
connection, all that stuff to
which, which causes problems

1025
00:45:59,179 --> 00:45:59,778
Suze: Yeah.

1026
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:00,728
Dan: can cause some problems

1027
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:02,108
Suze: Yeah. Where do

1028
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:03,203
Dan: there was a, there was
some, there was some good, the

1029
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:04,267
keynotes

1030
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:06,639
were live, so the keynotes were
live. And then there was other

1031
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,938
talks that were recorded, which
hybrid hybrid combo,

1032
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,798
Suze: Hmm. Yeah, sometimes they
do, um, prerecorded talks and

1033
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,659
then live Q and a that's quite
nice.

1034
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:16,523
Dan: Yeah,

1035
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,259
Suze: You can see that the
speakers have tried to do the

1036
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:23,068
continuity thing by wearing the
same clothes that they wore in

1037
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:26,449
the recording for the Q and a.
But I did notice, like somebody

1038
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:27,768
would rearrange their room in
the few weeks in between. I was

1039
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:29,087
like,

1040
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,728
oh, okay. Yeah, you didn't think
of that. Did you eat the plants?

1041
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:35,208
Moved, walked across the room?
Yeah. Yeah.

1042
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:38,983
Bekah: Well, and so, you know,
we've talked about all of these

1043
00:46:38,983 --> 00:46:40,378
different things that you've
done. Well, a lot of them, but

1044
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:41,773
we

1045
00:46:41,773 --> 00:46:44,204
haven't really hit on your book.
So I would love to hear about

1046
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:47,833
like, you know, this is another
thing you took on. Why did you

1047
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:51,134
decide to write a book? And what
was that process in reception?

1048
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:51,403
Like.

1049
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:57,954
Suze: Well, this book is not
something I actually made the

1050
00:46:57,954 --> 00:47:01,434
decision to do per se. I didn't
sit down. I didn't wake up one

1051
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,704
day and say, right, I want to
write a book, it was something

1052
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:08,664
that I wanted to do. When I was
a child, I always thought, yeah,

1053
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,403
I'm going to write book at some
point, but I always thought it

1054
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:12,443
was going to be fiction because
I think a lots of kids like

1055
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:14,483
writing

1056
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:17,333
stories, don't they? Um, but
yeah, I kind of didn't really

1057
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,393
think about it too much. And
then, um, always been interested

1058
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:22,673
in writing and that was what I
was mostly interested in when I

1059
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,853
was doing the marketing stuff,
like, uh, communications and

1060
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:29,094
things like that. So yeah,
somebody actually reached out to

1061
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:32,108
me on Twitter and said, they've
got this project. Um, And would

1062
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:35,122
I

1063
00:47:35,123 --> 00:47:41,454
like to contribute to it? the
series is called 32nd and, um,

1064
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:46,284
The books that existed before my
one. So my one's 32nd coding

1065
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:50,574
where things like 32nd
architecture, 32nd biology, 32nd

1066
00:47:50,574 --> 00:47:53,724
chemistry, you know, all these
32nd history, things like that.

1067
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:59,934
And, um, the objective is to get
across like 50 different topics

1068
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:02,663
within that whole theme within
that book within about 170

1069
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:05,392
words.

1070
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,653
So they, I think they said to
me, oh, I saw your blog. And I

1071
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,437
think

1072
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:14,248
you would be really good for
this project. And also what's

1073
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:17,608
interesting actually is that
these, uh, the publishers

1074
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:22,199
published the book in like, I
think 30 or 50 different

1075
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,431
languages or something like
that. So I might actually come

1076
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,663
across

1077
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:29,018
this book in a different country
with a, B you would recognize

1078
00:48:29,018 --> 00:48:31,372
the

1079
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:32,468
branding, which is funny. So
even though you do what you

1080
00:48:32,468 --> 00:48:33,563
didn't

1081
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,994
understand what the words on the
front side, you know, from the

1082
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:40,643
picture. So, um, so yeah, so he
said to me, you know, I'd really

1083
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:43,943
like you to contribute to this
book. So yeah, in the end there

1084
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,184
for some of the books, 15
contributors, but on this one,

1085
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,523
there's only three. So I got to
write quite a nice chunk of this

1086
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:55,313
book. Um, so yeah, to have sort
of, uh, like variables, how do

1087
00:48:55,313 --> 00:48:57,118
you explain what a variable is
in like 174 words? It's quite

1088
00:48:57,118 --> 00:48:58,923
hard

1089
00:48:59,583 --> 00:48:59,733
Bekah: Yep.

1090
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:04,804
Suze: and, um, you know, arrays
and functions and loops and all

1091
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:05,074
of that

1092
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,784
Dan: you have your, can you, can
you just do your, can you do the

1093
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:09,134
variable one? Do you have it
somewhere?

1094
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:11,884
Suze: I've got my book in front
of me. I can read out to you

1095
00:49:11,963 --> 00:49:13,383
Dan: yeah. Yeah. Just, just,
just do it or pick one, pick

1096
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,803
one. It

1097
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:16,034
doesn't have to be the variable
one, but that,

1098
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,389
Suze: Right. Let's do variables
cause like that. You didn't say

1099
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,838
to me, just tell me what a
variable is in 170 words because

1100
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:28,463
I, yeah, it's not the sort of
thing you can remember. We'll be

1101
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:33,204
able to articulate, but right.
Okay. So variables, we use

1102
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,204
variables in programming to give
us an easy way of labeling and

1103
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:39,114
therefore recalling and
manipulating memory locations in

1104
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:41,934
which we store pieces of
information. For example, our

1105
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,553
program might ask the user for
their name and location. When

1106
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:45,172
the

1107
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:47,934
user submits these pieces of
information, we can assign these

1108
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:49,718
values to name variables,
current years Suze" and current

1109
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:51,502
user

1110
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:55,139
location equals Europe. I
deliberately said Europe because

1111
00:49:55,228 --> 00:49:57,043
the UK left the EU, but we're
still in Europe. So holding on

1112
00:49:57,043 --> 00:49:58,858
to

1113
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:02,849
that, that's just a note, that's
a footnote, but no one we're

1114
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:07,829
still in Europe. Please
understand that the computer is

1115
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:10,378
still with these values and the
memory locations associated with

1116
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,378
each variable. This allows us to
greet the user by name with a

1117
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:16,469
salutation appropriate to the
time of day where they are. When

1118
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:19,139
declaring a variable, we can
decide whether or not its value

1119
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,984
can be modified. We also need to
decide the scope of the

1120
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,829
variable,

1121
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:25,918
where it can be seen in use in
the program. Some variables have

1122
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:27,448
a global scope so they can be
used anywhere in the code.

1123
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:28,978
Others

1124
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:30,778
have a scope that is limited to
a specific code block. For

1125
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,578
example,

1126
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,128
current time may only exist in a
function where you are

1127
00:50:35,128 --> 00:50:37,619
determining whether it's morning
or evening in the user's time

1128
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,509
zone. In addition to a name and
value, variables in most

1129
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:45,139
programming languages also have
types. For example, a variable

1130
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:49,199
whose type is integer can hold
whole number values. There you

1131
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:49,489
go.

1132
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:50,409
Dan: Nice.

1133
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:52,619
Suze: 170 words on variables.

1134
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,303
Dan: I think that's great. And
variables. Yeah. I mean, I

1135
00:50:54,303 --> 00:50:55,958
that's

1136
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,053
why specifically? I said, can
you read it to me? Cause I was

1137
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,148
trying

1138
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:00,818
to figure out how to, you know,
the thought process about like

1139
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:03,034
distilling something down to.
You know, to a simple language

1140
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:04,929
like

1141
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:08,139
that. Um, and that quickly is,
that's takes a lot of skill and,

1142
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:09,599
um, thought and that was really

1143
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:12,789
Suze: Yeah. I feel like, cause
you know, Bekah said earlier,

1144
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:14,573
I've tried so many different
things. I feel like. Um, and

1145
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:16,357
also

1146
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:19,119
it goes back to, you know,
wanting to do that different

1147
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,639
thing or be unique. I always
seem to go for the hard way of

1148
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,159
doing

1149
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,389
stuff. So it is much harder to
write something short than it is

1150
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,719
to write something longer.

1151
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,088
Dan: absolutely.

1152
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:32,259
Suze: So yeah, definitely got

1153
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:34,449
Bekah: 100%. I'm trying to...

1154
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:35,903
Dan: yeah, mean, you could see
an entire book written on the

1155
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:37,357
topic.

1156
00:51:37,418 --> 00:51:38,693
I mean, you know, I can, I'm
sure that I'm sure there are

1157
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:39,968
entire

1158
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:42,248
books written on the topic, so
that's yeah.

1159
00:51:43,108 --> 00:51:45,298
Bekah: I'm trying to write a
proposal for a lightning talk

1160
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:48,023
right now. And it's, it's five
to seven minutes. you tell me 45

1161
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:50,748
to

1162
00:51:50,748 --> 00:51:56,009
60 minutes, no problem. I can
give you quite a few different

1163
00:51:56,009 --> 00:52:02,369
talks, I having such a hard time
figuring out how I will talk

1164
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,518
about. Anything for, just five
to seven minutes, it's more

1165
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:11,228
overwhelming to have less time
than it is to have that whole

1166
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:11,739
hour.

1167
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:15,978
Suze: Yeah, I think in a five to
seven minute talk, you probably

1168
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,036
only want one argument. Don't
you because you only have time

1169
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,033
for

1170
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:24,173
one there's, you can't really do
three takeaways. You need to one

1171
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:27,233
argument and really argue the
heck out of the argument. I

1172
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:30,954
think, and it goes really fast.
I remember at school, one of the

1173
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:33,443
things they made us do every
year, which was really evil.

1174
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,244
Cause I went to an all girl
school. So you can imagine that

1175
00:52:35,244 --> 00:52:37,376
was like, Horrible in itself.
But every year they made us

1176
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:39,508
stand up

1177
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:44,518
in front of the entire class a
speech that we had prepared. And

1178
00:52:44,548 --> 00:52:47,159
yeah, that has served me well in
adult life, but it was quite

1179
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:51,539
traumatic way of, of getting the
skills. and yeah, so I think we

1180
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:54,509
had to do, was it a two minute
talk or five minutes? It was

1181
00:52:54,509 --> 00:53:00,429
really sure, but it felt like it
was going to be forever, but now

1182
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:03,179
yeah, 20 minutes is too short
for me, I think.

1183
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:09,804
Bekah: uh, we're just about at
time here. And so one more

1184
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:12,983
question, and maybe you don't
have a straight answer for this,

1185
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:16,344
but of all of the things that
you've done, what has been your

1186
00:53:16,344 --> 00:53:17,494
favorite challenge?

1187
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:26,728
Suze: My favorite challenge.
Yeah, that is a good question.

1188
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:32,284
Hm. Okay. I've got two from I'll
choose two from this year

1189
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:35,139
because

1190
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:38,809
I'm struggling to remember
anything pre pandemic.

1191
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,119
Dan: as are we all, Yeah.

1192
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:45,188
Suze: I I'll say, two from this
year, which again are really

1193
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:48,659
different things that I had
never done before. So the book

1194
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,468
definitely, which I actually
started last year, but that,

1195
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:51,817
that

1196
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:55,628
whole process is long. Uh, but
that got published. The book got

1197
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:59,349
published at the beginning of
October. 2021. For any of you

1198
00:53:59,438 --> 00:54:01,673
good folks of the future who are
listening to this podcast? Um,

1199
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,908
on

1200
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,039
the same day as Dave Grohl's
book. I don't know. I

1201
00:54:08,139 --> 00:54:09,409
Bekah: You were retweeted,

1202
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:15,278
Suze: I know. Yeah. Yeah. So
Dave Grohl is my best friend. I

1203
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:19,789
tweeted about my book and said,
It's been published on the same

1204
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,829
day as Dave Grohl from the Foo
Fighters and the Foo Fighters

1205
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:25,039
tweeted me back and said
Congrats... oh my God. Holding

1206
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:27,079
the book in my hand was
something. And then I got that

1207
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:29,309
tweet. I was like, oh, I don't
even need this book now I've got

1208
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:33,139
a tweet from the Foo Fighters.
Like really? Um, and then last

1209
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:35,719
weekend I actually went into a
physical book shop for the first

1210
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:38,659
time, probably since pre
pandemic. And I found my book in

1211
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:41,838
there and I was like, yeah, that
was so weird because yeah,

1212
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,018
because I was like, hang on a
minute. This is a copy of the

1213
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:48,608
book that I don't own. And it's
going to be in somebody else's

1214
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,693
house. This is just so wild to
me that my name is going to be

1215
00:54:50,693 --> 00:54:52,778
in a

1216
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:55,403
thing in somebody's house is
just really well. yeah, the

1217
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:58,028
book, um,

1218
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:02,798
because that is just something
that just kind of, I don't know,

1219
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:05,438
I always wanted to do, but I
never seriously thought that I

1220
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:07,778
would do it and I haven't
actually made a plan to do it.

1221
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:12,579
So, yeah, that's a big
achievement for me. also earlier

1222
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,511
this year, right at the
beginning of the year, I

1223
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,443
actually did a six

1224
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:19,018
hour live stream conference type
thing. So I don't know if any

1225
00:55:19,018 --> 00:55:21,593
you

1226
00:55:21,594 --> 00:55:25,733
have heard of global diversity
CFP day. It is a, um, it's an

1227
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:28,463
annual event. And this year it
was online for obvious reasons

1228
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:30,958
where we encourage people from
underrepresented groups to

1229
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,913
submit

1230
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:38,153
proposals to CFP so that we can
get more diversity on the tech

1231
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:43,643
conference stages. And so I was
given the brief of.... Um,

1232
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:48,398
organized a six hour live stream
find speakers for it and things

1233
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:52,668
like that. So I found some
speakers. I did some firesides

1234
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:55,920
did a bit of slight karaoke. I
am seated all. I produced it

1235
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,152
all.

1236
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:02,603
yeah. Now if you said to me do a
five-hour one, it'd be like

1237
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:05,603
nothing. Cause I've already done
a six hour one. So yeah, I'm

1238
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:09,534
really proud of that because at
one point, um, probably towards

1239
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,419
the end, I did a shout out and
said, look, you know, Post in

1240
00:56:11,419 --> 00:56:13,304
the

1241
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,643
chat. If you've been with me for
the whole six hours I was here

1242
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:18,764
people had, and one of them
actually said I hadn't planned

1243
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:24,043
to, but it was so good I stayed.
So, uh, yeah. So, know, people

1244
00:56:24,043 --> 00:56:27,043
are choosing to spend six hours
of their life on a, uh, on a

1245
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:30,193
Saturday with you then, um,
you're doing something right

1246
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:33,643
aren't you. uh, yeah, those are
my two big things that I'm proud

1247
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:34,273
of this year.

1248
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:35,884
Dan: that's awesome.

1249
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:40,179
Bekah: Yeah, great. And I love
that. if someone asks me to do a

1250
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,504
five-hour one, I, we easy, cause
I've done a six hour one. I

1251
00:56:42,504 --> 00:56:44,829
think

1252
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:48,148
that's a fun way to approach
doing anything.

1253
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:51,018
Suze: Yeah. Yeah. Five, 5 hours
and 59 minutes. No problem.

1254
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:56,259
Bekah: I got this. Well, Thanks
so much for being here with us

1255
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,648
today. This has been great to
follow along the things that

1256
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:04,599
you've done and to hear all of
your tips. So, thank you. And

1257
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,378
we'll talk to you soon.

1258
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:07,938
Suze: Thanks. Thanks. for
inviting me. It's been a

1259
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:08,389
pleasure.

1260
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:09,858
