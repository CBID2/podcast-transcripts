00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:10,942
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season two, episode eight of the

2
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:13,881
virtual coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,820
that

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,989
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:22,354
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,719
their

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,329
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,814
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,299
it with

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,240
you. Here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,289
Dan: Thanks Bekah. We have a
fantastic episode today. We got

12
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,333
the chance to sit down with
Sarah McCombs. Sara is a

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,377
software

14
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:45,840
engineer and a team lead at
Aiera. But more importantly to

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,469
us, at least, Sara is one of the
original organizers and current

16
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,380
Community Maintainer at a little
online community you may have

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,020
heard of called Virtual Coffee.
We talked about Sara's unique

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,020
career arc, how she was able to
leverage past experiences to

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,750
differentiate herself and how
she has found some success by

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,739
embracing her history and her
own unique skills and strengths.

21
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,375
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

22
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,435
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

23
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,280
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,125
Today's

25
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:20,045
question is: If you could have a
theme song, what would it be? We

26
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:31,277
hope you enjoy this episode.
Hey, I'm Bekah. I'm a front end

27
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,676
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have a

28
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,075
theme

29
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:40,096
song, this is a little bit hard
because I, my music is based on

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:48,016
mood. And so I like to listen to
a lot of sad music. Um, but I

31
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:51,728
would probably want something
that gives me energy and. I

32
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:55,440
guess

33
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:58,111
we'll go with, We Will Rock You
by Queen. Cause that sounds

34
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,781
good.

35
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:01,887
Sara: that's a good one.

36
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,212
Bekah: Or Rocky soundtrack, you
know?

37
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:09,092
Dan: Um, hi, my name is Dan. I'm
a front end developer from

38
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:14,192
Lakewood, Ohio. Yeah. If I could
have a theme song. So is this

39
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:20,042
like an aspirational theme song
or a, um, accurate theme song?

40
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,731
Um, the first thing, the first
song that popped into my mind

41
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,680
was

42
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,511
a song. By a band called The
Head and the Heart called Lost

43
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,311
in my

44
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,097
Mind. Um, it's a pretty good
song and that's, that's what I'm

45
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,882
going

46
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,132
to go with. It's probably
accurate. And you know, it's not

47
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:39,032
actually really sad or anything.
It's, it's pretty good. But

48
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,292
anyway, that's it.

49
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,893
Sara: Hi, I'm Sara. I'm a
software engineer from Boston,

50
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:49,302
Massachusetts. If I had a theme
song, um, I would have to pick

51
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,312
something that I a always sing
to because that's what a theme

52
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:53,322
song

53
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,853
should be, um, be sing horribly
too, because you're just, you

54
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:01,992
don't care. Um, and I kinda, I
don't know, I feel weird

55
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,122
admitting this it's a Post
Malone song. Um, is it

56
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,252
sunflower? Um,

57
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,627
that just makes me so happy and
I don't care what I'm doing,

58
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:12,042
what

59
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,647
I'm in the middle of. I will
stop and turn that up. And that

60
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,251
just

61
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,962
feels like that that should be
my theme song.

62
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,242
Bekah: I love it.

63
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:18,853
Dan: Yeah, that's

64
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,777
Bekah: I love sunflowers. I,
when I was a community

65
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,562
organizer, I

66
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:25,682
used to drive to this small
community in rural Pennsylvania,

67
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,832
and there was this huge field of
sunflowers and it was like, it

68
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,832
was fun to watch it through the
stages because it grows up and

69
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:34,443
then they're all happy. And then
like when sunflower flowers die,

70
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,992
they get really sad. It's a full
moon.

71
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,798
Sara: they look depressed.
They're like depressed flowers,

72
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,307
they're flowers with anxiety or
something. I don't know. I love

73
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:43,487
it.

74
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:50,487
Bekah: I enjoy it. I think I
wrote a poem about it once. Um,

75
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:54,087
thanks so much for being here
with us today, Sara, we are very

76
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:56,937
happy to have you on the
podcast. Um, and we'll just,

77
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,697
we'll just

78
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,302
kick it off. Uh, we like to
start with the origin story and

79
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,906
you've

80
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:08,728
got a very interesting one. So
we love to hear how you got from

81
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,358
where you were into software
engineering.

82
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:17,822
Sara: Absolutely. Um, yeah, I do
have an interesting story. Um, I

83
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:21,362
never know where to begin. Uh,
really, uh, so this may be all

84
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,457
over the place, but that's kind
of the point of a podcast,

85
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,552
right?

86
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,733
You just, you just talk and you
end up wherever you end up. Um,

87
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,160
so. I did actually intend to go
into computer science many,

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,717
many,

89
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:36,218
many years ago. I had a love of
computers since I was very

90
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,367
little. I have memories of my
mom's saving money to buy a

91
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,516
Tandy

92
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,272
computer. I wish I could
remember the model, but I don't.

93
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,027
That's

94
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,697
like, I always want to pick the
1000, but I don't think that was

95
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:51,648
it. Um, but sitting next to her
while she was learning DOS and

96
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,918
I'm learning letters from a book
that is like three inches thick.

97
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,588
And I would just read the
commands off to her and it was

98
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,072
great because it was like, ah,
changing directory. Okay.

99
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:00,556
There's

100
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:04,817
a C there's a D you know, um, so
she learned that I learned that

101
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:08,887
way. Fast forward many, many,
many years graduated high school

102
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:13,228
with a full scholarship for
computer science to WVU Was not

103
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:18,077
exactly welcomed there,
unfortunately, uh, I have, uh,

104
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,887
lots of things to be said about
that, but it discouraged me

105
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:25,187
greatly. And I left, I, uh,
rescinded my, or gave up my full

106
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,557
scholarship and decided to
pursue other interests of mine,

107
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,927
which

108
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:34,173
were agriculture. Obviously my
interest in tech being what they

109
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:37,833
were. I ended up working in a
nice niche of ag and technology.

110
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:43,233
Um, I worked, Oh my gosh. I, I
loved what I did. Um, working

111
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:47,612
with ag tech tools to identify,
feed efficiency in livestock. I

112
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,637
could have a whole podcast
episode on that. But that

113
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:51,662
really,

114
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,502
really showed me, like I was not
done with this. I was not over

115
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:59,420
it. I ended up actually had to
learn rails. Working as a

116
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,451
research director, because the
communications team wouldn't

117
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,091
spend time to build the
templates, to display my data

118
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,325
properly. And it was just like,
I can do this. It's fine. Um,

119
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,559
and

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,240
that was really when I realized
I wanted to do that. Um, instead

121
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:18,620
try to get back into it. Did
some freelance stuff. Um, really

122
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,205
didn't gain traction living in
West Virginia, it was just

123
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,790
really

124
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,920
hard. Uh, the local market
industry is, um, I guess pretty

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,420
small, pretty close remote,
really. Wasn't a thing, um, that

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,325
I had my daughter and, you know,
there's that moment when you

127
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,230
have

128
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,180
a baby and you're holding them
and you're looking down and

129
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,661
you're just like, What do I want
to teach them? You know, I want

130
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,521
to teach them not to have any
regrets. And then you start

131
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:43,975
thinking about, you know,
regrets that you have. And it

132
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:45,429
was like, I

133
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,951
have unfinished business, you
know, I have unfinished business

134
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:54,521
in the tech industry. Um, so I
decided to fix that. And I went

135
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:56,206
into Flatiron, I did the
Flatiron online program for

136
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,891
software

137
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,911
engineering. Um, graduated with
that met great people in the

138
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:08,000
Virtual Coffee community and.
Ended up with the job where I am

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,141
now, um, through some great
networking and, and I could not

140
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,471
be here.

141
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:19,555
Bekah: So awesome. Um, so for
those of you who are joining us

142
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,125
and haven't been around for an
entire year, uh, Sara is one of

143
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:27,956
our original organizers of
Virtual Coffee and she and I met

144
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:30,908
in person almost two years ago
at a conference in Pittsburgh.

145
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,800
Um,

146
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,201
and I'm Flatiron in grad, too.
We had like the little Flatiron

147
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:40,701
group going on and, um, Sara is
much taller than I am.

148
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,100
Dan: it's funny. You guys look
the same height here on my

149
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,430
screen.

150
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,146
Sara: well on zoom, nobody has
legs. So

151
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,050
Dan: We're all just the same
height, right?

152
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,380
Bekah: Yeah. So it's been really
great to, you know, pair with

153
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,035
Sara and both of us, like kind
of growing at similar times,

154
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,690
right?

155
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:04,250
Like I was learning and you were
learning. And at some point I

156
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,065
think I was a little bit ahead
of you, but it just was really

157
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,880
nice

158
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,640
to, you know, have that
relationship with someone who

159
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,400
was

160
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,430
going through these things and
understood all of the challenges

161
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,821
that we were facing. And to have
someone like jump in and say

162
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,951
like, Hey, let's do this, you
know,

163
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,985
Sara: Yeah. Yeah. And it was, it
was really your learning in

164
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,735
public, um, on Twitter. I mean,
that was, that was how you and I

165
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,365
connected, even with as close as
we were geographically. Like

166
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,255
there was nothing that forced us
to meet other than you posting

167
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,114
on

168
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,780
Twitter learning and public
being vulnerable saying, Hey,

169
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,445
I'm

170
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,936
learning to try and make a
tutorial on how to create an SVG

171
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,086
in Figma. I'm just like, I don't
know anything about Figma. I'm

172
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,451
the perfect subject matter
expert on if this tutorial is

173
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,816
great or

174
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,720
not. Um, and I watched it and
gave you feedback and then

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,624
you're

176
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,735
like, Hey, we should talk your,
your, your semi-local to me, uh,

177
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:57,615
found out we're both going to
this conference. So we, we made

178
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,316
it, we made a point to grab
coffee of all things,

179
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
Bekah: And that is where it
started.

180
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,346
Sara: and that's where it
started.

181
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:09,607
Bekah: Yeah. So you're, I, I
feel like you just have so much

182
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:12,607
history that you're right. We
could have spent like four hours

183
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:16,807
on just like how you got here.
And Sara is the, um, the head of

184
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,447
random agricultural facts at

185
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,027
Sara: I think, yeah, I think
it's called Cow Facts. Uh, they

186
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,602
all

187
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:25,602
have a tendency to be cows, but
it's really livestock related

188
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,663
facts. Yeah. That's me.

189
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,273
Bekah: And so you've, you like
made this really big transition,

190
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:36,472
right? And like, I love how
you've bridged your past

191
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:40,072
experience with your experience
now, like even like in

192
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:44,033
conversations, but what you're
doing. And I know that talking

193
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,582
about transferable skills is
really hard and that's something

194
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,802
that, like, we hear a lot about
that. So, you know, like how

195
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,022
have

196
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:55,462
you been able to leverage that
experience to support where you

197
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,592
are now? Or like, what does that
process look like?

198
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:04,523
Sara: um, Transferable skills is
a soap box that I willingly jump

199
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:09,052
on. I think every opportunity I
get, um, if you've ever been in

200
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:11,513
and been in a breakout room with
me at Virtual Coffee, you will

201
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,302
know I go there. Um, it, it was
kind of a multifaceted process.

202
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:17,091
I

203
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,877
mean, I don't think there was
ever like an intentional, like,

204
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,662
I

205
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,853
must do this process to see
these things, but. We all have

206
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,043
imposter

207
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,408
syndrome. Like you hear it. W
I'm glad that people talk about

208
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,773
it.

209
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm glad that it's a public
thing. I mean, let's talk about

210
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,363
imposter syndrome as much as we
talk about mental health, you

211
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:33,592
know, because for me, they're,
they're one in the same

212
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,821
believing

213
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:37,852
that you can do something and
recognizing that you are already

214
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,327
skilled for something before you
begin is a huge weight lifted

215
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,802
off

216
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:47,753
of anyone's shoulders. Um, but
it's also sometimes hard for us

217
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,845
to recognize that. There are
skillsets that we have from

218
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:51,907
other

219
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:56,798
industries, other jobs, other
aspects of life, um, that

220
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,627
empowers to do our job, you
know, in the, in the tech

221
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,456
industry.

222
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:04,807
Well, um, the biggest one that,
you know, I always think about

223
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:09,097
is, uh, one that I can relate to
is, is becoming a mom. I mean,

224
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:13,597
there's no like. Aspiring moms,
like, you know, I used to say I

225
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:16,538
was aspiring, you know, software
engineers, just like, well, what

226
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,112
is an aspiring software
engineer? Like what, when does

227
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,657
an aspiring

228
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,207
software engineer stop being an
aspiring software engineer? Like

229
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:23,633
what, what's that threshold?
What's the success metric for

230
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,028
it?

231
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:27,877
And I realized, you know, with
being a mom, it was like, I had

232
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,557
a

233
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,762
baby. So now I'm a mom and I'm
going to do mom things. I have

234
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:33,967
no

235
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,482
idea about how to be a mom. I'm
a first time mom, but I'm going

236
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:36,997
to

237
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,518
reach out to other individuals
who are more experienced to me.

238
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,462
So my senior developers, I'm
going to read any documentation.

239
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,272
I can find AKA every book that
is free from the library on what

240
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,082
to

241
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,113
do when your baby does X or what
to expect when you're expecting

242
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,232
that's documentation for
motherhood. There's going to be

243
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,372
support groups. You know,
there's gonna be a local mom's

244
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:55,512
group.

245
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:56,862
That's going to help you
navigate things that you've

246
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,181
never dealt

247
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:02,743
with before, or, um, processes
that you don't know how to deal

248
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,863
with. Like, I'm still running
into things, you know, with my

249
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,503
daughter in preschool, it's like
this week's teacher appreciation

250
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:13,062
week. I don't know how we do
this. Like, how do you, this is

251
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:17,082
my first time, but I'm doing it
and I'm doing it because I

252
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:22,332
recognize that I can find the
answers myself or find somebody

253
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,507
who can help me find the
answers. I know I can ask the

254
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,682
questions. I

255
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:30,357
know I can. Research enough on
the internet to try to find some

256
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:33,567
semblance of an answer and then
take that research to someone

257
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,138
more experienced than myself. My
mom, you know, anyone else with

258
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:40,168
parents that have more than one
child and you know, than I do,

259
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:46,018
um, and say, Hey, am I close? Is
this right? Um, to ask those

260
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,732
vulnerable questions of just
like. I don't know how to change

261
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:50,247
a baby. How do you change a
baby? Nobody. There's no YouTube

262
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,762
video

263
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,578
on how to change a diaper. So
you reach out and the nurse at

264
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,393
the

265
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:58,633
hospital will show you because
she did. She looked at me a

266
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,613
little, a little strangely and
laughed, and I'm just like, I

267
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,082
don't know how to do this, but I
was never an aspiring mom. I was

268
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:09,860
just a mom. You know, nobody
made me less than because I was

269
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,425
completely inexperienced, but I
had the drive and the desire

270
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,990
and.

271
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,990
I guess, I don't know the
pluckiness to just figure it out

272
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,129
because honestly, I feel like
that's what software engineering

273
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,909
is. It's just figuring out one
thing after another, you know,

274
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,019
things change things evolve so
quickly. Same with children, you

275
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,509
know, how things work, how
school systems work. Um,

276
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,999
especially now

277
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,814
since we're virtual, like we
were all learning how to be

278
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,599
parents of

279
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,042
virtual school children, now.
It's just recognizing that.

280
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,484
We're

281
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,965
not dictionaries. We don't just
sit here and, and, you know,

282
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,074
vomit out code for something
that we've remembered in our

283
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,183
head.

284
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,179
We're recognizing patterns.
We're recognizing when we don't

285
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,174
know

286
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:57,124
something to ask somebody else.
It's just, you figure it out.

287
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,074
You

288
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:04,264
know, you engineer it, you find
the solution. And it's hard to

289
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:09,860
recognize, especially for a
career changer like myself. That

290
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,330
you already have skill sets and
you already have abilities that

291
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,120
you have harnessed for years
because you've been a parent for

292
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,649
X years, or you've been a
manager in another industry for

293
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,178
X years,

294
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,409
or you've been in customer
service for other years or

295
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:22,639
you've

296
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,309
been a customer in other years.
Like it's sometimes it's just

297
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:33,230
having your eyes open to like,
Oh, I am, you know, empowered to

298
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,524
do this. I do have skillsets.
It's just a different. Industry.

299
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:41,524
It's just a different problem,
but the solution steps are

300
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:46,174
potentially still the same. And
I like, I like to have

301
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,955
conversations about that because
when I had that realization that

302
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,605
I was not an aspiring engineer,
I was just an engineer because I

303
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,184
was doing the thing and it was
dedicated to learning. And I was

304
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:01,784
dedicating to doing it to the
best of my ability and dedicated

305
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,764
to taking feedback for when I
could've been doing it better. I

306
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:09,889
was just an engineer. And I want
everyone else to kind of have

307
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,059
that, that comfort, that
satisfaction. So, yes, that's a

308
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,710
soap box. I will willingly jump
on.

309
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,980
Bekah: I think it's great. And
you've done such a good job

310
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,689
supporting the members and
telling them exactly these

311
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,398
things

312
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,539
that they need to hear. And I
think last night I think it was

313
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,940
last night. Somebody had been
listening to the podcast from

314
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,664
Virtual Coffee and they
referenced a previous episode

315
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,388
and

316
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,710
said, Bekah, you said you never
had any manager experience, but

317
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,250
you're a mom of four kids. Like,
what do you think you're doing?

318
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,475
Yeah. It was hard to think about
it in those different ways, but

319
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,040
it is, you're always learning.
You're always pivoting and

320
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,605
making

321
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:51,294
new decisions. And, you know, a
lot of people will say like,

322
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,374
well, you have four kids, you
know, I don't know how you do

323
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:53,454
it.

324
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,210
And it's the same way that you
do it in a job. Like if you have

325
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,965
to

326
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,705
do it, you will do it. You know?

327
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,644
Sara: you just do the thing.
Because you have to do the thing

328
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:06,304
and that's no different than
whenever at work. If I get, you

329
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:09,424
know, um, assigned, you know,
particular features that I have

330
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:11,539
to implement, there's a lot of,
a lot of the product that I

331
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,654
don't

332
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,434
even understand the finer
details, the finer inner

333
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,214
workings

334
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:24,565
of how it works and that's okay
because I figured it out. I know

335
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,590
who to ask these questions of
and you break apart the problem

336
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,615
into

337
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,909
achievable steps and you just do
it, you just do the thing. And

338
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,220
then when you're done, you sit
there and you look at it, you're

339
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,620
like, yeah. You know, pat
yourself on the back, you, you

340
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,070
achieved something. Awesome. And
then you're going to get another

341
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,210
task. And that process is going
to start over and you're going

342
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,350
to

343
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,929
panic and you're going to be
like, I don't know how to do

344
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:51,250
this. Oh my gosh. Where do I
start? Just like the previous

345
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
problem. You start again.

346
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,494
Dan: yeah. I love that. And like
the idea of leaning back on

347
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,778
those

348
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,984
experiences like diaper
changing, right. Is I had never

349
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,189
changed a

350
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,069
diaper before my first kid was
born. Um, I don't think, uh, and

351
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,009
definitely didn't know how to do
it. Right. And definitely asked

352
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:11,959
the I'm like, what is the right
way to do, like do this? I'd

353
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,909
read

354
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,119
books, I'd read, read the docs,
whatever, little different when

355
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:22,525
you're there, but it, and it
seemed. Hard and stressful, I

356
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,875
suppose, thinking about it ahead
of time. I mean, I know it did

357
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:28,404
right. And now I've changed like
7 billion, billion trillion

358
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:31,855
diapers, and it's like not a big
deal. Right. And, you know, so

359
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,104
it, so the idea of like leaning
back on previous experiences

360
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,784
from

361
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,270
different fields and
transferring skills, even if

362
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,755
they're not like

363
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:44,484
I don't have to change any
diapers here at the office. But,

364
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,644
but I have just like you were
saying, I've been through that

365
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:51,115
experience of like a thing seems
scary and unknown. And I was

366
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,904
like, and then I learned how to
do it. And then I did it a bunch

367
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:58,555
of times and now I'm like good
at it. And that's something it's

368
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,075
it's I love how you said that.
It's, it's like very important

369
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,914
and cool to be able to like, I
don't know when you're feeling

370
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:07,755
like that. Just to think back on
other things that you have, you

371
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,634
have done, you know, cause
everybody's any, even if you, I

372
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:13,464
mean, not even if, but if you
don't have kids, you're still

373
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:15,219
like a person who has moved
through life. So, uh, th

374
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,974
there's,

375
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:20,325
there's lots of things to lean
on in that way,

376
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,883
Bekah: Yeah, I'm just kind of
like going down this path of, I,

377
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:26,212
you know, I wonder why it seems
like such a struggle for so many

378
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:30,712
people, um, to be moving into
careers as software engineers.

379
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:34,077
And I don't know if. It's, we
don't learn a ton of new stuff

380
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:37,442
as

381
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,032
adults in the same way that we
do as when we're kids, right?

382
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:40,622
Like

383
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:43,803
you're constantly learning
something new and everything

384
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:48,603
feels like a risk, but in adult
life, there are, I feel like

385
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,103
almost fewer of those risks,
because you've kind of like

386
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,603
built

387
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,843
that up to this point. And I
don't know if that's what makes

388
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,863
it seem scary to move forward,
but it is like, you know,

389
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:04,428
essentially that idea of, you
know, Being afraid, or I don't

390
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,587
know if it's being afraid of
failure. It's probably different

391
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,018
for everyone. I guess it's being
afraid of failure for me. So

392
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:11,647
Sara: I would say it's probably
different for everyone. I mean,

393
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,042
I

394
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:16,972
think that's a very valid
comparison as well too. And one

395
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:21,442
that I hadn't even thought of
yet, but as children, every new

396
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:25,432
day, every new life moment is
something new. We potentially

397
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,232
have never encountered it
before. Or, you know, we've

398
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,032
played on a

399
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,337
playground before we fell off
the slide, you know? And now

400
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,642
we're

401
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:35,613
just like, Oh, slides are scary.
Yeah. But then we go to a new

402
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:39,182
park and it's like, Oh, there's
another slide, but maybe that

403
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:42,573
slide's not scary. And that's
like a natural as children. We

404
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:45,692
don't think about that is, you
know, learning and leaning on

405
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:47,702
previous experiences to like
navigate current experiences.

406
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,712
Um,

407
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:54,843
but we're trained to do that as
children and as we get to

408
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,642
adulthood, we may not do that as
much anymore. And is that

409
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,441
because

410
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:03,145
we may stay in careers longer. I
don't, I don't know is that

411
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,026
because things are rapidly
changing in this industry that

412
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,541
it's like, I blink and there's
new framework and there's,

413
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,056
here's

414
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,080
a new tool that I need to learn.
Um, or you have individuals

415
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,104
like,

416
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,705
you know, us we're we're career
changers, you know, we're, we're

417
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:17,905
going from one industry to
another, and now we're

418
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,105
navigating

419
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:23,486
a completely different set of
construct rules, everything. Um,

420
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:24,746
yeah,

421
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:28,105
Bekah: I feel like I love that
the whole, uh, the playground

422
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:29,815
just makes a lot of sense to me,
I think because you know, part

423
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,525
of

424
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:34,226
that playground, I think if you
fall off that slide and you're

425
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:37,076
the only kid on the playground,
it's much harder to get back up

426
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:40,556
on that side. Right. But like
you see all these other kids and

427
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,801
they're doing it and that just
kind of gives you a little bit

428
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,046
of

429
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:46,786
confidence. And for a lot of us
and a lot of people that we talk

430
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:51,016
to they're navigating the
transition into tech Oh alone,

431
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,281
whether they're self-taught or
in an online bootcamp. And

432
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,546
there's,

433
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:59,836
you know, a lack of value placed
on community. But when you see

434
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,696
other people around you doing
it, like it does something, it

435
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,556
gives

436
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:05,191
you the energy sometimes that
you need in those moments where

437
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:06,826
you

438
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:09,235
feel like, wow, I, you know,
like fell off the slide and I

439
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,644
need to

440
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,365
get back on.

441
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Sara: it's also important when
you have community, because I

442
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,205
have never. I've never succeeded
at a hard thing alone. Um, I've

443
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,076
always needed community in some
aspect, whether that was like a

444
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:27,566
micro circle of friends that I
leaned upon that just, I w I was

445
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:31,346
vulnerable to, or like Virtual
Coffee, a much larger community.

446
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:33,475
Um, using the playground as an
analogy, you know, as an

447
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,515
example,

448
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,930
when you fall off that side, you
sometimes also need a person

449
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,655
that

450
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,100
says, Hey, I'm scared to do the
slide again. Can you help me?

451
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,545
And

452
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,415
you need to have a great
community and empathetic

453
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,615
understanding compassionate
community that doesn't laugh at

454
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,705
you because you're saying the
side is easy and the person

455
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,655
you're telling that to, it's
just like, Oh, this slide's not

456
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:57,595
a big

457
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,816
deal. It's just, you know, it's
only two feet long. It's like,

458
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,081
no, we don't need that. You
know, we need someone that grabs

459
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,326
your

460
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:07,736
hand says, Hey let's do it
together. And that's, that's

461
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:11,486
something that I've needed to
reach where I am and something I

462
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:15,026
will always need and will always
provide to other people.

463
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,319
Bekah: Yeah. And, you know, I
think that, you know, capturing

464
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:26,164
that idea of self doubt, being
such a big obstacle for career

465
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:30,125
changers and for new developers
and, you know, people who have

466
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,884
been in the industry for a long
time, but maybe are going up for

467
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,295
promotion or didn't get that
promotion. That's really hard to

468
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:40,595
navigate when, when you're by
yourself, you know,

469
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:44,529
Sara: Yes. Uh, even if you
wanted to potentially go ask

470
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,703
somebody,

471
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:49,795
is this right? Can I get advice?
Can, can I have some mentorship

472
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,374
or can you just hold my hand
when I go get on this new slide?

473
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:54,923
Um,

474
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,889
Nobody needs to do anything
alone and nobody needs to feel

475
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:59,854
that

476
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:03,154
sense of isolation. we're all
learning. We're all doing this

477
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:03,515
together.

478
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,430
Bekah: Yeah. And I think too,
you know, this idea of like

479
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,250
leveraging your past, all this
stuff that you were saying about

480
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,294
that, that clicks for me here in
a lot of ways too, because I

481
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:14,338
know

482
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,024
that sometimes when I'm afraid
to try something new, then I

483
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:19,709
it's

484
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,680
important for me to lean on the
things that I know really well.

485
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,230
And it's leveraging that
experience or, you know, I, I

486
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,142
spent a while thinking like, I
taught English for 10 years and

487
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:29,054
I

488
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:31,785
was a community organizer for a
little while. Like I want to run

489
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,244
from that. I don't want to do
that anymore. This is why I'm

490
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:37,944
making this transition. And
within the last, I don't know,

491
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:41,875
even a couple of months, I felt
like, you know what, leaning on

492
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,139
those things and, and
remembering what I've learned

493
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,344
from that can

494
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:48,235
really benefit me from this,
from it in this moment. So it's

495
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:50,125
not

496
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,545
like a rejection of that past.
It's like, let's embrace these

497
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:54,565
two things together.

498
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,019
Sara: Yeah. Yeah. And for me
personally, in those moments,

499
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,704
it's when I reflected on it
after the fact, it's helped me

500
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:04,389
to

501
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,420
understand how far I've come as
well of just like, Oh, okay.

502
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,450
Even

503
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,210
though this the situation, you
know, I, you know, in my job,

504
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,580
current job was, was new for me,
that thing in the past, you

505
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,920
know,

506
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,942
my, my previous career helped
me. Like I've grown. Like it's

507
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,964
a,

508
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:24,904
it's a metric to really say,
like, I I've, I've grown up, I'm

509
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:29,765
achieving things. Like I
recognized how much personal

510
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,515
growth I've had that I hadn't
really been aware of until I hit

511
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,060
a moment when I would have
paused a little bit more, I

512
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,605
would have

513
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:40,068
had a little bit more self doubt
and, everything in my past is

514
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,678
helped me get to where I am now
and recognizing that I can use

515
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:44,597
it

516
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,888
is very comforting.

517
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:49,031
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. And I
think, you know, sometimes it

518
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:52,912
takes a minute to get to that. I
think in a lot of circumstances

519
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,899
and that's hard. I don't know
how to teach that. Like, is

520
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:56,706
there a

521
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,916
way to teach that? I think that
maybe you just have to discover

522
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,876
that for yourself, but I wish
that I could help more people

523
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:04,686
discover that

524
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,001
Sara: That's why there's
community it's to have people

525
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:10,191
around you that are your
personal cheerleaders that care,

526
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,351
that will

527
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,751
remind you why you're awesome.
And remind you that you can do

528
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:22,751
the thing because you've done X
other hard thing. It's I think

529
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:27,852
community. It's there's no,
nothing really to teach. It's a

530
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,852
feeling it's a sense of
belonging. It's a sense of being

531
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:36,491
supported. It's a sense of, um,
being a powered as who you are

532
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:40,602
not because you need to learn X
or you need to learn Y. Like we

533
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:43,612
all need to learn X and we all
need to learn Y. We just have

534
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:46,056
different experiences that we
can leverage to find a solution.

535
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:48,500
So

536
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,342
leverage them because. If you
learn X and you learn Y and

537
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,362
you're just like everybody else,
you're going to achieve the same

538
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:59,182
answer, potentially just as
everybody else, it takes diverse

539
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,772
backgrounds. It takes leaning
upon diverse previous

540
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,362
experiences

541
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,132
and those transferable skills to
find new solutions to things,

542
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,902
new

543
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,361
processes, you know, new
features for a product that

544
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:10,820
potentially an

545
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,051
existing team had not thought of
before. It's these transferable

546
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:17,346
skills that bring diversity to a
team, you know, in regards to

547
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:19,641
how

548
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:22,461
an individual approaches a
problem and finds the solution.

549
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,956
Bekah: Yeah. And so I feel like
there's a twofold problem here

550
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:26,770
or

551
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:32,936
not a problem, but situation. I
don't know. So it's. In your own

552
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,961
mind thinking like I can
leverage this and then like the

553
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,986
second

554
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:41,336
part of that is now, how do I
leverage that and get other

555
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,017
people to see

556
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:43,902
Sara: Yes. Right,

557
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:46,737
Bekah: I don't know. Do you have
any tips there that would

558
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:50,741
Sara: Uh be your authentic self.
Um, it has always worked for me.

559
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:57,352
I, I find embracing my past and
sharing what I've learned, hence

560
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,441
the random cow facts, uh,
happened Virtual Coffee. Um, As

561
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:03,470
a

562
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:05,061
safe way to show everyone else
in the community, and those that

563
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,651
I

564
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:10,701
interact with that, like my past
is still relevant. It's still

565
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:16,011
part of who I am. Um, and
embracing that and having

566
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,791
conversations around that
demonstrate some of these skills

567
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:24,021
to individuals. That's what sets
you apart from everybody else

568
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:25,791
right now? And that's you,
that's not something you can

569
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,561
learn.

570
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,046
That's not, not a certificate
that you can achieve and then

571
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,531
put

572
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:32,931
on a resume. It's it's, you
know, the fact that, you know,

573
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,331
for an

574
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,416
ag tech company, I'm an
extremely, you know, good

575
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,470
looking

576
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:44,152
candidate because I have.
Agricultural background. I have

577
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:46,056
knowledge that I can lean upon,
you know, and I have skillsets

578
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:47,960
to

579
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,641
potentially better understand
how a farmer might use a

580
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,991
particular

581
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:52,701
product, because, well, I worked
with that farmer and I, you

582
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,411
know,

583
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:57,216
I supported that farmer and, um,
it's those points that we need

584
00:27:57,216 --> 00:28:00,020
to

585
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,136
not hide and showcase. Um, I,
I'm struggling to remember a

586
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,251
quote

587
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:07,882
that I saw on Twitter this
morning, but it was spot on, but

588
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,956
it was talking about leaning
into what makes you unique

589
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,030
because if

590
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:16,382
you don't lean into it, somebody
else will. And that person will

591
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:20,402
be who gets set apart from
others. and I, I find that to

592
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,912
always be very true a for the
fact that it highlights my

593
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:27,332
transferable skills, it
highlights these additional

594
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,426
knowledge sets that could be
very beneficial to an employer,

595
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:33,520
but it

596
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:37,144
also. Reminds me of who I am.
And why I'm, you know, I don't

597
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:40,767
want

598
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:44,886
to say off, cause that sounds so
unhumble, but like, you know why

599
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,676
I am awesome. It's like, and it
makes me feel comfortable to be

600
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:54,336
myself more in communities that
it, it helps me to overcome the

601
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:55,953
negative feedback that I've
heard in the past of like, well,

602
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:57,570
How

603
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,912
can you be a software engineer?
If you have a degree in dirt,

604
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:02,612
which is literally been what
I've been told, um, what can we

605
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:05,132
now,

606
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,311
um, you can, you know?

607
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,711
Bekah: Do you go back and like
find those people and just send

608
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:14,622
them your resume. Is that, is
that what we're supposed to do?

609
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:18,196
Sara: isn't that what LinkedIn's
for mean? I don't know. Um, no,

610
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:21,071
I

611
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:26,507
haven't, trust me the want's
there, um, But I did get to turn

612
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:31,596
down a job offer to an employer,
but I didn't quite, I wasn't

613
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,416
rude. Um, I, as much as I wanted
to say it just like, yeah, you

614
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,556
undervalued me and you gave me
stress for the fact that I

615
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:36,696
didn't

616
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:40,237
have a CS degree. And, um, I'm
so sorry that I only have a

617
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,636
bachelor's and a master's degree
in another, you know, uh,

618
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:47,041
technical field. Apparently not
enough and not relevant for my

619
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:53,642
ability to somehow tell you that
I can learn a lot. But yeah, I

620
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,801
just said, no, I would like to

621
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,481
Dan: Seems like a good call,
maybe.

622
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,352
Sara: Tik Toks for that, you
know, where you just flex, like

623
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,612
overcoming those things,

624
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,061
Dan: I was thinking more like,
um, like mailing them a box of

625
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:08,112
dirt or something, you know?

626
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:09,701
Bekah: Okay.

627
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,461
Sara: wouldn't be dirt. It
wouldn't be

628
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,622
Dan: Well, sure. Right. Yeah.
Cow products.

629
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:16,837
Bekah: Bye. Oh, can we just get
a shade button on LinkedIn? Like

630
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:19,217
I

631
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:19,606
would,

632
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:20,352
Sara: I know, right?

633
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,856
Bekah: that feature. Okay.

634
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:25,981
Dan: Yeah. Flex, flex button.
that. Okay.

635
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,688
Bekah: yeah, and I think, you
know, this idea of transferable

636
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:33,508
skills and really showing what
makes you unique and awesome. It

637
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:39,462
really. A good way to figure out
how to, I think, leverage that

638
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,133
maybe is really through
networking, right? Because you

639
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,972
can walk into a room full of
people. And if everybody is

640
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:50,502
talking about the same thing,
Oh, I made this to do app or

641
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:53,502
whatever, like that's great, but
who are they gonna remember?

642
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,143
They're gonna remember the cow
lady, right? Like.

643
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,147
Sara: Yeah. Yeah, I would, I
would agree with that. And, um,

644
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:07,548
that, that kind of is a little
bit of how I got my job now. I

645
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:09,362
reached out to Bryan Healey in
our Virtual Coffee community,

646
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:11,117
um,

647
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:13,743
trying to get into the ag tech,
uh, side of things. Um, see if

648
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:15,978
he

649
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:18,145
had any connections. Um, he
didn't really, um, but. You

650
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:20,312
know,

651
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,468
it, it eventually turned into,
okay. Let's, let's talk about

652
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:22,623
the

653
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,603
jobs that you're applying to.
Let's, let's, let's look at your

654
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:26,223
resume a little bit. Let's,
let's talk about these things.

655
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:27,843
And the

656
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,208
conversation started to
unfolding more and more and

657
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,573
more, as I

658
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:33,663
talked about what I've done and
things I built, um, both

659
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,512
personally professionally
processes I've, you know, made

660
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:41,363
and improved and it turned into
like, wow, okay. You, you might,

661
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:46,403
you know, not have two to five
years, you know, software

662
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,863
engineering experience, like
most, most jobs required. But I,

663
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:51,472
I recognize that you're a person
that I literally can throw into

664
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,687
the deep end and you're going to
swim. And I've done that. And

665
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,882
I'm

666
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,883
happy as a clam that I get to
wear five hats at work. And I,

667
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:05,143
um, to have this, uh, what, what
was the phrase like to use the

668
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:06,643
fire hose of information to my
face constantly of just like

669
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:08,143
what

670
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,482
is going on at work? What needs
to change? What needs to happen?

671
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:14,048
Things are moving so fast, but
I'm absorbing it all and I'm

672
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,312
loving it. And, um, it was that
networking that genuinely

673
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,576
showing

674
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:23,048
up as my authentic self, talking
about my past, um, that really

675
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,147
helped me to showcase. I mean,
I'm not going to say that like

676
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:27,938
doing that, it's just going to,
you know, get you job offers to

677
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,417
everybody that you do that too,
but people will talk and you'll

678
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:35,528
get known as the cow lady. In
communities and they'll be like,

679
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:38,647
Hey, you know, I think she could
probably handle whatever you're

680
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,827
going to throw at her. So like
maybe go talk to her. and that's

681
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,448
what happens, you know?

682
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:47,573
Bekah: Yeah. When, like, since
you've been there, it's just

683
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:49,162
been, I feel like you've been
sprinting the entire time.

684
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,751
Right.

685
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,447
Because I would love to like
dive a little bit into that

686
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:54,142
timeline

687
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:56,962
because it was like, Oh, we're
going to hire Sara. Oh, she's

688
00:32:56,962 --> 00:33:00,292
awesome. We're going to hire her
more. Oh, she's awesome. We're

689
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:00,742
gonna.

690
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,167
Sara: Yeah,

691
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:03,952
Bekah: not yet, but that's like,
you know,

692
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,188
Sara: I threatened that. Um,

693
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,648
Bekah: but like walk through
that because that process is

694
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:10,403
intense.

695
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:14,573
Right? You have accomplished so
much in a very short amount of

696
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,173
time there.

697
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:19,948
Sara: Yes. So I was originally
hired as a contractor, um, and

698
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:22,617
that was supposed to be for,
cause obviously hiring during

699
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:26,188
COVID it was, you know, strange
times and, um, there was a need,

700
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:28,188
but with the way things were
going, hiring was frozen in a

701
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:30,188
lot

702
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,517
of places. And I was, I was
happy to just have an

703
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:32,846
opportunity. I

704
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:35,758
was happy to like basically say,
Hey, you know? Yep. I'll prove

705
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:37,302
myself. You know, I'll work as
a, as a part-time contractor.

706
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:38,846
That's

707
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:43,968
great. You know, that'll a, it
ultimately helps me, um, Add

708
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:45,342
something to my resume, get some
experience, uh, learn how to

709
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,692
work

710
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:51,163
with a large, large team of much
more senior engineers. But it

711
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:56,742
also gave me a chance to prove
myself to the company. And if it

712
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:59,202
didn't end up transitioning into
a full-time job, which was the

713
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,912
ultimate goal, great, no harm,
no foul, you know, I still come

714
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,622
out

715
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:08,023
of it with experience. Um, I
think that lasted a month. Um,

716
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:11,322
things went so well. Uh, there
was a need, they recognized that

717
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:13,287
I could fill the need. Um, there
was a conversation of like,

718
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,252
okay,

719
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:18,373
we're immediately going to be
doubling your work hours. You

720
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,442
will responsible for X, Y, Z,
and one, two, three. And that

721
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,511
was

722
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:26,983
fine. It was a little
intimidating, but what's the

723
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,733
worst thing I could do. Like get
some experience and like learn

724
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:35,922
how not to do a thing. Um, you
know, that was, that was how I

725
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:39,313
approached it. And. I ended up
transitioning to a full-time

726
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:46,032
employee and yeah. Um, startup
life is, is rapidly evolving.

727
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:50,472
Every day is chaos. I love it.
Some days are more chaos than

728
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:52,907
others. But I got comfortable
with my team really fast. Like

729
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,342
I,

730
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,338
for a while, quite a while was
the most junior individual

731
00:34:57,338 --> 00:34:58,943
there.

732
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:00,427
Everybody knew each other.
Everybody had worked together

733
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:01,432
for

734
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,522
years. But I just decided to
just have a one-on-one with

735
00:35:04,522 --> 00:35:07,612
everyone.

736
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:09,998
Talk to them, recognize they're
human recognize of who I could

737
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:12,353
go

738
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:15,052
to, for what reason, for
questions. I specifically made

739
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:16,882
that a point in my one-on-ones
with everyone to say, if I have

740
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,712
a

741
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:23,483
problem, what can you help me
with? Um, and I just started, I

742
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:27,103
just started doing things and I
just slightly leaned into I

743
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,472
guess, a phrase that I was
taught when I worked for the

744
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,841
university

745
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,777
of was it's better to ask
forgiveness than permission. So

746
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,652
I

747
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:36,507
would just start writing
documentation of just like,

748
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:37,362
well,

749
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:38,862
this is lacking, this is
missing, you know, write this

750
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,362
down because

751
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:43,152
I'm doing it. And it was the
perfect time. Um, and then I

752
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:46,753
started recognizing that, Oh,
Oh, this is somewhere that I can

753
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,182
really contribute because
documentation's kind of out of

754
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:50,607
date because everyone here has
already got their environment

755
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,032
set

756
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,027
up. And like, you know, this is
a place that I can contribute.

757
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,022
Um,

758
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,293
And then I started as I'm
learning and going through other

759
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:03,253
parts of our product and our
process, seeing things that just

760
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,194
need tweaked. And it started
just being a lot of tweaking and

761
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:09,135
then

762
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,250
a lot of tweaking turned into,
okay, well, we're going to,

763
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,365
we're

764
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:14,785
going to give you this part of
the product now. And you're

765
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:16,145
gonna

766
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:19,065
own this and you're gonna learn
it and you're gonna be

767
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:24,215
responsible for it. And. Again,
process improvement, tweaking,

768
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,275
seeing what I could do or asking
questions, um, asking for

769
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,820
examples in, in the existing
code base, whenever I would need

770
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,365
to do

771
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:31,640
a feature that I was just like,
I don't know. I don't know how

772
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,915
you

773
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,700
want me to do this. Like never
done this before, but I'll

774
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,484
figure

775
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:43,326
it out. Um, yeah. And now I'm in
charge of a team of people and

776
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:48,846
hiring, unfortunately, firing.
Um, that's not fun part by the

777
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:51,485
way. Doing a lot of
documentation, a lot of process

778
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,965
improvement. Yeah, I love it.
And it's, it's been nonstop and

779
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:56,445
it's

780
00:36:57,346 --> 00:37:03,376
really started with kind of
leaning back on my agricultural

781
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,605
experience of like, when you
show up on a farm, the cows are

782
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:05,834
not

783
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,455
going to tell you what's wrong.
You just stand there, look at

784
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:09,075
it,

785
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:13,155
make a lot of observations, do a
little bit research, you know?

786
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,470
And then just start trying
stuff, see what works. Um, you

787
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,959
might

788
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,025
have to MacGyver it. You might
have to get the baling twine

789
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,090
out.

790
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,185
You might have to get the duct
tape out. You might have to

791
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:23,280
like,

792
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:27,811
make it look ugly. So it works.
That's fine. You just might need

793
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:30,090
to fix the fence for five
minutes. Like, so the cows stay

794
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,541
in tomorrow. You're going to
refactor your code base and it

795
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,840
will be pretty efficient and
performance. And that's kind of

796
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,338
how I started. And. That's
worked very well for me. Um, I

797
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,805
will say

798
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,710
there's no cows in our code
base. Um, but the process still

799
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,614
works.

800
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:50,686
You know, I can do a thing that
achieves the feature and then

801
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:54,295
thankfully with the help of my
more senior team, over time,

802
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:57,905
I've, I've gotten better at
developing the proper style for

803
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,560
how I do things. So my naming,
my variables, uh, separating

804
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,215
things

805
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,061
properly apart with how we're
currently doing it for code

806
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,456
base,

807
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,645
all of these things. And it's
because I just dove in, because

808
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,325
I

809
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:13,059
recognize that I've done this
before with farm animals when

810
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,559
they can't tell you what hurts,

811
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:16,724
Dan: a little bit of structured
YOLO

812
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,738
Sara: I've Structured YOLO. Oh
my gosh. Yes. I yes, it is

813
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:21,748
always

814
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:22,559
structured YOLO.

815
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,498
Dan: Um, so Yeah, so I mean,
that was a lot, I mean,

816
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,228
Sara: Yeah.

817
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:31,539
Dan: you know, no, that was,
that's not what I meant, but I

818
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,878
just mean, like Bekah said, you
have accomplished so much, you

819
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,619
know, in, in what is it? Less
than a year? Something I,

820
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,579
Sara: yeah. Like seven months.

821
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,878
Dan: So one of the jumps in
there that you

822
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,778
Bekah: I just want to highlight
that Sara said seven months. So

823
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:50,168
all of that stuff that she said
she's done has been in the past

824
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:51,278
seven months.

825
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:52,539
Sara: I like

826
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,619
Bekah: deserved a moment.

827
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,233
Dan: That's what I meant by.
That was a lot. And, and, Yeah.

828
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,318
so, I

829
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,898
mean, one of the, you kind of
like jumped over a little bit.

830
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:05,699
Um, but the going from like just
solely individual contributor

831
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,268
role to managing a team, um, for
me, it seems like a pretty big

832
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:12,163
step, And so I kinda remember
you talking about it when it

833
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,058
happened

834
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:14,928
a little bit, but I was
wondering if you could talk a

835
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:15,797
little bit

836
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:21,139
about like, what, what that was
like, how your job changed, how

837
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,728
you approached it, you know,
that kind of thing.

838
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:26,448
Sara: Yeah, absolutely. Um, it
was terrifying, um, because now

839
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,603
I

840
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:32,943
recognize that, I'm responsible
for, uh, people, their

841
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:36,423
livelihood, you know, their
jobs. Um, and I think helping to

842
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:39,903
hire

843
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:46,983
someone for our support team was
really how my company recognized

844
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:50,403
that, Oh, she can do this. Um,
cause I was the one that led the

845
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:52,833
interview. Um, I led all the
interviews for that particular

846
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:53,193
hire

847
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,594
Dan: So that was a hire. I'm
sorry to interrupt, but that was

848
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:59,253
a real, that was for a role that
was not your ma like that you

849
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,143
wouldn't be like, this is just a
separate role that,

850
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,574
Sara: yes, It was a separate
support role for our product and

851
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:09,538
they let me do the interview,
um, because I was learning this

852
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:12,453
part

853
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,664
of the process product I was
going to be, um, being primarily

854
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:19,114
the person that they reported
to, even though I wasn't at that

855
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,423
point in time, uh, I guess I
don't see it designate their

856
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:24,693
supervisor or their manager. Um,
but I was just like the first

857
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:26,028
point of contact. So at that
time I probably would have been,

858
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,363
you

859
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,164
know, a lead of some sort, I
guess, if you had to put a,

860
00:40:29,164 --> 00:40:30,994
really a term on it, but, um,
just the person that they went

861
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:32,824
to

862
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:38,224
before I went to the next level.
Um, but yeah, it, I did an

863
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:41,576
interview. It, it went very
well. Um, I started, you know,

864
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:44,928
touching

865
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:47,778
base with all of them. And it
was terrifying because now I

866
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,627
have

867
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,403
seven people that look at me of
like, Hey, I need help with X

868
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:56,058
or,

869
00:40:56,088 --> 00:41:02,449
um, my time sheets messed up or,
um, any, any other access issue.

870
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:06,753
Um, but I. I just kind of
approached it like I would

871
00:41:06,753 --> 00:41:09,454
anybody else in the community
that I'm in of just like, Hey, I

872
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:12,934
have a problem. Um, but I, I
also kind of took note of who

873
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:16,414
they

874
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:17,899
were, you know, I networked with
them a little bit. I, I wanted

875
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:19,384
to

876
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:23,764
know what their interests were,
um, what their overarching goals

877
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:28,414
were, uh, with, with the job
here, with their career, so that

878
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:30,093
I can understand is there, are
there opportunities internal

879
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:31,772
that

880
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:36,364
I can. See them grow into and
that's happened quite a few. She

881
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:40,023
got quite a few times with our
agents. Um, can I help them grow

882
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:42,543
internally with their career?
And that's, that's terrifying.

883
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,063
Um,

884
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:53,434
but it feels great because, um,
again, I structured YOLO. I just

885
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:57,619
did it and I, I remembered what
it was like to be an employee

886
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:02,148
somewhere of what I would like a
manager to do. And I recognize

887
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,248
that, you know, I might be
restricted in certain

888
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:06,348
situations.

889
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,719
I can't make everybody have a
thousand dollars an hour, you

890
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,829
know, wage, even if I would like
them to. Um, but I can advocate

891
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,958
on their behalf to make sure
that they're, they're not, you

892
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:17,087
know,

893
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,474
making less than they should.
Uh, I will always do that. Um,

894
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:21,829
but it

895
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,478
was. I don't know, it was
terrifying at first. Um, but

896
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:30,018
I've, I've grown into it and
I've, I'm enjoying it and I'm

897
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:32,989
enjoying seeing them grow. And
I'm enjoying seeing them slide

898
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:37,278
into, you know, different roles
that they're, they're excelling

899
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:41,088
in and I'm enjoying that
relationship, um, that I have

900
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:44,838
with all of them. I feel like
I'm, I'm, I'm meandering now on

901
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:45,679
the, on the topic. So

902
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,119
Dan: No, no, no. This is exactly
what I

903
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,068
Sara: wrangle me back on topic.

904
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,579
Dan: no, no, this is, this is
exactly what I want to talk

905
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,994
about. I like the. This
transition from individual

906
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:02,143
contributor to manager is always
a interesting thing, you know?

907
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,649
Um, and, and so every, every
time we have somebody that has

908
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,344
gone

909
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,804
through that, I, I ended up just
trying to dig in a little bit

910
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,023
because I liked to learn about
it. You know, I like hearing

911
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,903
about it. And, um, it's one of
those interesting things in our

912
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:15,606
industry where it's like, Lots
of times, it seems like there's

913
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:17,309
just

914
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,119
a ceiling, you know, um, on how
far you can go as an individual

915
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,458
contributor and then like the
only choices management after

916
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,759
that, you know, um, which I w I
would say is not always true,

917
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:32,398
but, um, but I do like, right.
And, well, absolutely. And, um,

918
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:36,659
but I like hearing about like,
and sharing what that transition

919
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,068
is like, like what the
difference is,

920
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:38,358
Sara: yeah.

921
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:42,528
Dan: between, you know, between
the two, the two roles, um,

922
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,318
Sara: I definitely reached out a
lot. Um, either the individuals,

923
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:51,579
um, within the company of just
like, how do I navigate X

924
00:43:51,608 --> 00:43:54,369
situation? You know? How often
should I have one-on-ones, how

925
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,778
often should I do this process
with my team? Um, which was

926
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:02,193
incredibly helpful, but I also.
Looked to other individuals,

927
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,693
especially in that Virtual
Coffee community, um, who are

928
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:05,193
managers

929
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:07,533
who onboard people, who, who,
uh, support new hires to just

930
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,873
say

931
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:12,514
what is going well for you? Um,
and seeing if I can take that

932
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:15,094
and

933
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:18,183
implement it internally, um,
just to be the best that I can

934
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:21,243
at my

935
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:25,744
role, but also to support my
employees the best that we can.

936
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:32,148
Um, so being willing to. Take
advice from everywhere was, was

937
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:32,989
definitely helpful.

938
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,884
Dan: Yeah, I love that. Do you
find yourself writing like a lot

939
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,963
less code, like doing a lot
less, you know, IC kind of work.

940
00:44:43,074 --> 00:44:46,793
Sara: Oh yes. Um, just by the
very nature, I'm now busy with

941
00:44:46,793 --> 00:44:50,514
process improvement process, you
know, well creating there's some

942
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:52,629
processes that don't exist, um,
that we are creating now. Um,

943
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:54,744
but

944
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:59,898
I actually. I focus more on
internal tooling, um, and just

945
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:03,378
ensuring that our tooling is
built, uh, and in a fashion that

946
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:05,133
can support our current
processes as well as any

947
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:06,888
upcoming

948
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:11,478
processes, which is nice. Um, I
occasionally still implement

949
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:14,889
features within our product that
enable our current processes or

950
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:17,214
new processes to happen
properly. Um, so like I have

951
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,539
minor changes

952
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:25,494
in our, in our existing code
bases now, but. Yeah, I do do

953
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:29,514
less coding and that's okay.
Because I recognize that my

954
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:35,123
strengths are potentially a
little bit more of, um, process

955
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:38,288
design, overseeing things,
product roadmaps, um, while

956
00:45:38,288 --> 00:45:41,033
still

957
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:44,963
being a technical individual. So
that's, that's where I see my

958
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:47,948
career going and I, I'm not
sure. Seven months ago, even a

959
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:50,933
year

960
00:45:50,934 --> 00:45:54,623
ago. That I would have said that
that's where I wanted it to be.

961
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:55,853
Um, I would have been like, no,
I want to code all day long.

962
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,053
Just

963
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,554
put me in a corner. Let me to
closet. Let me code the thing,

964
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:05,483
leave me alone. Give me coffee.
Um, yeah. So yay for growth all

965
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:05,784
around.

966
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:07,239
Dan: that's awesome.

967
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,824
Bekah: I mean, they're so
important because I think there

968
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:14,994
are so they're undervalued and
having someone who's new to the

969
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:18,414
process, who's new to a company.
I think that you can really see

970
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:21,443
those pain points like you were
talking about of like, okay,

971
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:23,513
well, you don't have this or
this is outdated. And then that

972
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,583
allows

973
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:29,048
you to, you know, See things
differently than people who have

974
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:31,958
been doing it for a long time
and to create those things and

975
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,469
understand the needs of other
people. And I feel like how

976
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:37,388
fortunate people are, if they
are being managed by you,

977
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:39,248
because you

978
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:43,418
have a real sense of like what
people need and a really great

979
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:45,578
pro approach to supporting those
people. And that's also

980
00:46:45,578 --> 00:46:47,738
something

981
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:51,639
that we just don't see nearly
enough of, um, from the

982
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:55,059
community, from the tech
industry. And I really feel like

983
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:59,244
in general, Um, what you were
talking about preschool earlier.

984
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:02,423
And I was thinking, you know,
schools just don't do a good job

985
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:04,043
of onboarding new families.

986
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:05,583
Sara: no, they don't

987
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:07,974
Bekah: It never occurred to me
until

988
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,003
Sara: be a product for that.

989
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:12,983
Bekah: exactly. Um, but like
parents will reach out to me and

990
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:15,713
be like, they're talking about
this thing. And I have no idea

991
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:17,543
what this thing means, but
nobody has explained it to me.

992
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,373
Right.

993
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:21,766
And it is that. Understanding
and taking note of and grabbing

994
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:24,159
that

995
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,298
feedback and like being willing
to ask questions that, you know,

996
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:31,073
you might be afraid to ask, but
that creates those processes

997
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:33,128
that

998
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:38,619
allow for a really, um, great
and successful work environment.

999
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,619
Sara: Yeah, I think something
that's always really served me

1000
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,869
well, and it's something I
always try to keep in mind is

1001
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:50,489
recognizing that. All processes
have a human element to them. So

1002
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:55,179
there's human processes in this.
And when you think about, you

1003
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:58,539
know, designing, uh, you know,
even a job description or

1004
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,079
designing processes for current
employees, like you have to take

1005
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,073
into account that there's a
human doing this, and you need

1006
00:48:04,073 --> 00:48:06,067
to

1007
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:10,628
support the human side through
this because you can write

1008
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:13,869
amazing documentation, but it's
written from a place of

1009
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,063
understanding. And then we bring
somebody new through the

1010
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:19,853
documentation. They're going to
have a lot of questions and you

1011
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,384
need to make sure that you
address the fact that they're

1012
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:23,813
going to feel confused, that
they're going to need to have

1013
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:27,143
questions. You need to identify,
you know, who to go to for

1014
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,963
questions and, and recognizing
that there's a human element to

1015
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:35,603
this and supporting the human
element. Um, I think really

1016
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:41,634
creates a great cohesiveness and
teams to a have good

1017
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:44,003
communication because we
recognize that. We're all

1018
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:46,372
humans.

1019
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,164
Um, and that we have human
feelings about things when they

1020
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:56,094
change. Um, but it just creates
more compassion and empathy in

1021
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:57,983
regards to like, if someone has
a bad day of like, you know,

1022
00:48:57,983 --> 00:48:59,872
Hey, I

1023
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:02,423
recognize I've changed this
process on you. I recognize it's

1024
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:03,968
new. You, you were doing it. You
know, the old way, potentially

1025
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,513
as

1026
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:10,403
an example, like there's nothing
to be upset about. Like. That's

1027
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:13,193
fine. We're human. Like I have
bad days. I forget what the new

1028
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:15,713
process is. I, I forget things.
Always having that human

1029
00:49:15,713 --> 00:49:18,233
centered

1030
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:20,708
approach to everything you do,
whether it's product

1031
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,183
development,

1032
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:24,684
whether it's engineering,
whether it's process

1033
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,184
development, whether

1034
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:29,063
it's management, having the
human centered approach is so

1035
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:31,500
important. And. Can easily be
forgotten because we just get

1036
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,937
our

1037
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:35,333
heads. So in the weeds and we
get blinders on and we're just

1038
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:36,728
like

1039
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:39,909
just process oriented and I just
need to do the thing. And we're

1040
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:42,728
not robots. There's a human
element to it. We always have to

1041
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:43,179
respect that.

1042
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:47,103
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. The what a great way to

1043
00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:48,777
end

1044
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,958
this podcast, the human centered
approach and why that's so

1045
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,829
important. Um, I want to thank
you so much for being here with

1046

I was like taking notes as we

1047
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:02,004

1048
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:04,369
really

1049
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,608

of these things and see how far

1061

knew it was going to be great,
you know, but like, I don't

1062
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:33,809
know,

1063
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,628
it was, it was very, very fun
and always. Just a pleasure. I

1064
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:37,358
feel

1065
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:38,693
like I miss you in breakout
rooms every time. So, you know,

1066
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:40,028
I'm

1067
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:42,188
going to have to force my way
into one of your breakout rooms.

1068
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:42,998
One of these days,

1069
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:46,764
Sara: See me get on a soapbox.
That'd be great.

1070
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:48,563
Dan: energy. I almost
interrupted before you, you were

1071
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:49,777
saying about

1072
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:53,259
soapboxes. I'm like, I love when
Sara gets on her soapbox. It's

1073
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,079
one of my favorite things. So
thank you for, uh, thanks for
