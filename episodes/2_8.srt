00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:10,942
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season two, episode eight of the

2
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:16,820
virtual coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,989
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,719
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,329
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,300
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,240
you. Here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

8
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,289
Dan: Thanks Bekah. We have a
fantastic episode today. We got

9
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,378
the chance to sit down with Sarah
McCombs. Sara is a software

10
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:45,840
engineer and a team lead at
Aiera. But more importantly to

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,469
us, at least, Sara is one of the
original organizers and current

12
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,380
Community Maintainer at a little
online community you may have

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,020
heard of called Virtual Coffee.
We talked about Sara's unique

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,020
career arc, how she was able to
leverage past experiences to

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,750
differentiate herself and how she
has found some success by

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,739
embracing her history and her own
unique skills and strengths.

17
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,375
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

18
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,435
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

19
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:15,125
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. Today's

20
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:20,045
question is: If you could have a
theme song, what would it be? We

21
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:31,277
hope you enjoy this episode. Hey,
I'm Bekah. I'm a front end

22
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:36,076
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And if I could have a theme

23
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:40,096
song, this is a little bit hard
because I, my music is based on

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:48,016
mood. And so I like to listen to
a lot of sad music. Um, but I

25
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:55,441
would probably want something
that gives me energy and. I guess

26
00:01:55,441 --> 00:02:00,781
we'll go with, We Will Rock You
by Queen. Cause that sounds good.

27
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:01,887
Sara: that's a good one.

28
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,212
Bekah: Or Rocky soundtrack, you
know?

29
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:09,092
Dan: Um, hi, my name is Dan. I'm
a front end developer from

30
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:14,192
Lakewood, Ohio. Yeah. If I could
have a theme song. So is this

31
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:20,042
like an aspirational theme song
or a, um, accurate theme song?

32
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:25,681
Um, the first thing, the first
song that popped into my mind was

33
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,312
a song. By a band called The Head
and the Heart called Lost in my

34
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:32,882
Mind. Um, it's a pretty good song
and that's, that's what I'm going

35
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,132
to go with. It's probably
accurate. And you know, it's not

36
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:39,032
actually really sad or anything.
It's, it's pretty good. But

37
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,292
anyway, that's it.

38
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,893
Sara: Hi, I'm Sara. I'm a
software engineer from Boston,

39
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:49,302
Massachusetts. If I had a theme
song, um, I would have to pick

40
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,323
something that I a always sing to
because that's what a theme song

41
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,853
should be, um, be sing horribly
too, because you're just, you

42
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:01,992
don't care. Um, and I kinda, I
don't know, I feel weird

43
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:06,252
admitting this it's a Post Malone
song. Um, is it sunflower? Um,

44
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:12,043
that just makes me so happy and I
don't care what I'm doing, what

45
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:15,252
I'm in the middle of. I will stop
and turn that up. And that just

46
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,962
feels like that that should be my
theme song.

47
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,242
Bekah: I love it.

48
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:18,853
Dan: Yeah, that's

49
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,562
Bekah: I love sunflowers. I, when
I was a community organizer, I

50
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:25,682
used to drive to this small
community in rural Pennsylvania,

51
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,832
and there was this huge field of
sunflowers and it was like, it

52
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:31,832
was fun to watch it through the
stages because it grows up and

53
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:34,443
then they're all happy. And then
like when sunflower flowers die,

54
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,992
they get really sad. It's a full
moon.

55
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,798
Sara: they look depressed.
They're like depressed flowers,

56
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,307
they're flowers with anxiety or
something. I don't know. I love

57
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:43,487
it.

58
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:50,487
Bekah: I enjoy it. I think I
wrote a poem about it once. Um,

59
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:54,087
thanks so much for being here
with us today, Sara, we are very

60
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:59,698
happy to have you on the podcast.
Um, and we'll just, we'll just

61
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,907
kick it off. Uh, we like to start
with the origin story and you've

62
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:08,728
got a very interesting one. So we
love to hear how you got from

63
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,358
where you were into software
engineering.

64
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:17,822
Sara: Absolutely. Um, yeah, I do
have an interesting story. Um, I

65
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:21,362
never know where to begin. Uh,
really, uh, so this may be all

66
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,552
over the place, but that's kind
of the point of a podcast, right?

67
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,733
You just, you just talk and you
end up wherever you end up. Um,

68
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:32,718
so. I did actually intend to go
into computer science many, many,

69
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:36,218
many years ago. I had a love of
computers since I was very

70
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:40,517
little. I have memories of my
mom's saving money to buy a Tandy

71
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:44,028
computer. I wish I could remember
the model, but I don't. That's

72
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,697
like, I always want to pick the
1000, but I don't think that was

73
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:51,648
it. Um, but sitting next to her
while she was learning DOS and

74
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,918
I'm learning letters from a book
that is like three inches thick.

75
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,588
And I would just read the
commands off to her and it was

76
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,557
great because it was like, ah,
changing directory. Okay. There's

77
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:04,817
a C there's a D you know, um, so
she learned that I learned that

78
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:08,887
way. Fast forward many, many,
many years graduated high school

79
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:13,228
with a full scholarship for
computer science to WVU Was not

80
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:18,077
exactly welcomed there,
unfortunately, uh, I have, uh,

81
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,887
lots of things to be said about
that, but it discouraged me

82
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:25,187
greatly. And I left, I, uh,
rescinded my, or gave up my full

83
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:29,927
scholarship and decided to pursue
other interests of mine, which

84
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:34,173
were agriculture. Obviously my
interest in tech being what they

85
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:37,833
were. I ended up working in a
nice niche of ag and technology.

86
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:43,233
Um, I worked, Oh my gosh. I, I
loved what I did. Um, working

87
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:47,612
with ag tech tools to identify,
feed efficiency in livestock. I

88
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:51,663
could have a whole podcast
episode on that. But that really,

89
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,502
really showed me, like I was not
done with this. I was not over

90
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:59,420
it. I ended up actually had to
learn rails. Working as a

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,451
research director, because the
communications team wouldn't

92
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,091
spend time to build the
templates, to display my data

93
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:09,560
properly. And it was just like, I
can do this. It's fine. Um, and

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,240
that was really when I realized I
wanted to do that. Um, instead

95
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:18,620
try to get back into it. Did some
freelance stuff. Um, really

96
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,790
didn't gain traction living in
West Virginia, it was just really

97
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,920
hard. Uh, the local market
industry is, um, I guess pretty

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,420
small, pretty close remote,
really. Wasn't a thing, um, that

99
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,230
I had my daughter and, you know,
there's that moment when you have

100
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,180
a baby and you're holding them
and you're looking down and

101
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,661
you're just like, What do I want
to teach them? You know, I want

102
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,521
to teach them not to have any
regrets. And then you start

103
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,430
thinking about, you know, regrets
that you have. And it was like, I

104
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,951
have unfinished business, you
know, I have unfinished business

105
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:54,521
in the tech industry. Um, so I
decided to fix that. And I went

106
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:57,891
into Flatiron, I did the Flatiron
online program for software

107
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,911
engineering. Um, graduated with
that met great people in the

108
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:08,000
Virtual Coffee community and.
Ended up with the job where I am

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,141
now, um, through some great
networking and, and I could not

110
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,471
be here.

111
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:19,555
Bekah: So awesome. Um, so for
those of you who are joining us

112
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,125
and haven't been around for an
entire year, uh, Sara is one of

113
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:27,956
our original organizers of
Virtual Coffee and she and I met

114
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:33,800
in person almost two years ago at
a conference in Pittsburgh. Um,

115
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,201
and I'm Flatiron in grad, too. We
had like the little Flatiron

116
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:40,701
group going on and, um, Sara is
much taller than I am.

117
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,100
Dan: it's funny. You guys look
the same height here on my

118
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,430
screen.

119
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,146
Sara: well on zoom, nobody has
legs. So

120
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,050
Dan: We're all just the same
height, right?

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,380
Bekah: Yeah. So it's been really
great to, you know, pair with

122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,690
Sara and both of us, like kind of
growing at similar times, right?

123
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:04,250
Like I was learning and you were
learning. And at some point I

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,880
think I was a little bit ahead of
you, but it just was really nice

125
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,401
to, you know, have that
relationship with someone who was

126
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,430
going through these things and
understood all of the challenges

127
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,821
that we were facing. And to have
someone like jump in and say

128
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,951
like, Hey, let's do this, you
know,

129
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,985
Sara: Yeah. Yeah. And it was, it
was really your learning in

130
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,735
public, um, on Twitter. I mean,
that was, that was how you and I

131
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,365
connected, even with as close as
we were geographically. Like

132
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:34,115
there was nothing that forced us
to meet other than you posting on

133
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,446
Twitter learning and public being
vulnerable saying, Hey, I'm

134
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,936
learning to try and make a
tutorial on how to create an SVG

135
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,086
in Figma. I'm just like, I don't
know anything about Figma. I'm

136
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:46,816
the perfect subject matter expert
on if this tutorial is great or

137
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:50,625
not. Um, and I watched it and
gave you feedback and then you're

138
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,735
like, Hey, we should talk your,
your, your semi-local to me, uh,

139
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:57,615
found out we're both going to
this conference. So we, we made

140
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,316
it, we made a point to grab
coffee of all things,

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
Bekah: And that is where it
started.

142
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,346
Sara: and that's where it
started.

143
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:09,607
Bekah: Yeah. So you're, I, I feel
like you just have so much

144
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:12,607
history that you're right. We
could have spent like four hours

145
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:16,807
on just like how you got here.
And Sara is the, um, the head of

146
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,447
random agricultural facts at

147
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:22,602
Sara: I think, yeah, I think it's
called Cow Facts. Uh, they all

148
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:25,602
have a tendency to be cows, but
it's really livestock related

149
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,663
facts. Yeah. That's me.

150
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,273
Bekah: And so you've, you like
made this really big transition,

151
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:36,472
right? And like, I love how
you've bridged your past

152
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:40,072
experience with your experience
now, like even like in

153
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:44,033
conversations, but what you're
doing. And I know that talking

154
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,582
about transferable skills is
really hard and that's something

155
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:51,023
that, like, we hear a lot about
that. So, you know, like how have

156
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:55,462
you been able to leverage that
experience to support where you

157
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,592
are now? Or like, what does that
process look like?

158
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:04,523
Sara: um, Transferable skills is
a soap box that I willingly jump

159
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:09,052
on. I think every opportunity I
get, um, if you've ever been in

160
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:11,513
and been in a breakout room with
me at Virtual Coffee, you will

161
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:17,092
know I go there. Um, it, it was
kind of a multifaceted process. I

162
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:20,663
mean, I don't think there was
ever like an intentional, like, I

163
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:25,043
must do this process to see these
things, but. We all have imposter

164
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:27,773
syndrome. Like you hear it. W I'm
glad that people talk about it.

165
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm glad that it's a public
thing. I mean, let's talk about

166
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,363
imposter syndrome as much as we
talk about mental health, you

167
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,822
know, because for me, they're,
they're one in the same believing

168
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:37,852
that you can do something and
recognizing that you are already

169
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:42,802
skilled for something before you
begin is a huge weight lifted off

170
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:47,753
of anyone's shoulders. Um, but
it's also sometimes hard for us

171
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:51,908
to recognize that. There are
skillsets that we have from other

172
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:56,798
industries, other jobs, other
aspects of life, um, that

173
00:10:56,798 --> 00:11:00,457
empowers to do our job, you know,
in the, in the tech industry.

174
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:04,807
Well, um, the biggest one that,
you know, I always think about

175
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:09,097
is, uh, one that I can relate to
is, is becoming a mom. I mean,

176
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:13,597
there's no like. Aspiring moms,
like, you know, I used to say I

177
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:16,538
was aspiring, you know, software
engineers, just like, well, what

178
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,658
is an aspiring software engineer?
Like what, when does an aspiring

179
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,207
software engineer stop being an
aspiring software engineer? Like

180
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:25,028
what, what's that threshold?
What's the success metric for it?

181
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:29,557
And I realized, you know, with
being a mom, it was like, I had a

182
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:33,967
baby. So now I'm a mom and I'm
going to do mom things. I have no

183
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,998
idea about how to be a mom. I'm a
first time mom, but I'm going to

184
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,518
reach out to other individuals
who are more experienced to me.

185
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,462
So my senior developers, I'm
going to read any documentation.

186
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:47,082
I can find AKA every book that is
free from the library on what to

187
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,113
do when your baby does X or what
to expect when you're expecting

188
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,232
that's documentation for
motherhood. There's going to be

189
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,513
support groups. You know, there's
gonna be a local mom's group.

190
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:58,182
That's going to help you navigate
things that you've never dealt

191
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:02,743
with before, or, um, processes
that you don't know how to deal

192
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,863
with. Like, I'm still running
into things, you know, with my

193
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,503
daughter in preschool, it's like
this week's teacher appreciation

194
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:13,062
week. I don't know how we do
this. Like, how do you, this is

195
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:17,082
my first time, but I'm doing it
and I'm doing it because I

196
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:22,332
recognize that I can find the
answers myself or find somebody

197
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:26,682
who can help me find the answers.
I know I can ask the questions. I

198
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:30,357
know I can. Research enough on
the internet to try to find some

199
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:33,567
semblance of an answer and then
take that research to someone

200
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,138
more experienced than myself. My
mom, you know, anyone else with

201
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:40,168
parents that have more than one
child and you know, than I do,

202
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:46,018
um, and say, Hey, am I close? Is
this right? Um, to ask those

203
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,732
vulnerable questions of just
like. I don't know how to change

204
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:51,763
a baby. How do you change a baby?
Nobody. There's no YouTube video

205
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:55,393
on how to change a diaper. So you
reach out and the nurse at the

206
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:58,633
hospital will show you because
she did. She looked at me a

207
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,613
little, a little strangely and
laughed, and I'm just like, I

208
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,082
don't know how to do this, but I
was never an aspiring mom. I was

209
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:09,860
just a mom. You know, nobody made
me less than because I was

210
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,990
completely inexperienced, but I
had the drive and the desire and.

211
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,990
I guess, I don't know the
pluckiness to just figure it out

212
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,129
because honestly, I feel like
that's what software engineering

213
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,909
is. It's just figuring out one
thing after another, you know,

214
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,019
things change things evolve so
quickly. Same with children, you

215
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,000
know, how things work, how school
systems work. Um, especially now

216
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,600
since we're virtual, like we were
all learning how to be parents of

217
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,485
virtual school children, now.
It's just recognizing that. We're

218
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,965
not dictionaries. We don't just
sit here and, and, you know,

219
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:51,184
vomit out code for something that
we've remembered in our head.

220
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:55,174
We're recognizing patterns. We're
recognizing when we don't know

221
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:59,075
something to ask somebody else.
It's just, you figure it out. You

222
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:04,264
know, you engineer it, you find
the solution. And it's hard to

223
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:09,860
recognize, especially for a
career changer like myself. That

224
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,330
you already have skill sets and
you already have abilities that

225
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,120
you have harnessed for years
because you've been a parent for

226
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,179
X years, or you've been a manager
in another industry for X years,

227
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,639
or you've been in customer
service for other years or you've

228
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,309
been a customer in other years.
Like it's sometimes it's just

229
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:33,230
having your eyes open to like,
Oh, I am, you know, empowered to

230
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,524
do this. I do have skillsets.
It's just a different. Industry.

231
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:41,524
It's just a different problem,
but the solution steps are

232
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:46,174
potentially still the same. And I
like, I like to have

233
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,955
conversations about that because
when I had that realization that

234
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,605
I was not an aspiring engineer, I
was just an engineer because I

235
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,184
was doing the thing and it was
dedicated to learning. And I was

236
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:01,784
dedicating to doing it to the
best of my ability and dedicated

237
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,764
to taking feedback for when I
could've been doing it better. I

238
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:09,889
was just an engineer. And I want
everyone else to kind of have

239
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,059
that, that comfort, that
satisfaction. So, yes, that's a

240
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,710
soap box. I will willingly jump
on.

241
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,980
Bekah: I think it's great. And
you've done such a good job

242
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,399
supporting the members and
telling them exactly these things

243
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,539
that they need to hear. And I
think last night I think it was

244
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,940
last night. Somebody had been
listening to the podcast from

245
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,389
Virtual Coffee and they
referenced a previous episode and

246
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,710
said, Bekah, you said you never
had any manager experience, but

247
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,250
you're a mom of four kids. Like,
what do you think you're doing?

248
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,475
Yeah. It was hard to think about
it in those different ways, but

249
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,605
it is, you're always learning.
You're always pivoting and making

250
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:51,294
new decisions. And, you know, a
lot of people will say like,

251
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:53,455
well, you have four kids, you
know, I don't know how you do it.

252
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:56,965
And it's the same way that you do
it in a job. Like if you have to

253
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,705
do it, you will do it. You know?

254
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,644
Sara: you just do the thing.
Because you have to do the thing

255
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:06,304
and that's no different than
whenever at work. If I get, you

256
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:09,424
know, um, assigned, you know,
particular features that I have

257
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:13,654
to implement, there's a lot of, a
lot of the product that I don't

258
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:17,215
even understand the finer
details, the finer inner workings

259
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:24,565
of how it works and that's okay
because I figured it out. I know

260
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:28,615
who to ask these questions of and
you break apart the problem into

261
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,909
achievable steps and you just do
it, you just do the thing. And

262
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,220
then when you're done, you sit
there and you look at it, you're

263
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,620
like, yeah. You know, pat
yourself on the back, you, you

264
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,070
achieved something. Awesome. And
then you're going to get another

265
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,350
task. And that process is going
to start over and you're going to

266
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,929
panic and you're going to be
like, I don't know how to do

267
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:51,250
this. Oh my gosh. Where do I
start? Just like the previous

268
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
problem. You start again.

269
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,779
Dan: yeah. I love that. And like
the idea of leaning back on those

270
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,190
experiences like diaper changing,
right. Is I had never changed a

271
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,069
diaper before my first kid was
born. Um, I don't think, uh, and

272
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,009
definitely didn't know how to do
it. Right. And definitely asked

273
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,910
the I'm like, what is the right
way to do, like do this? I'd read

274
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,119
books, I'd read, read the docs,
whatever, little different when

275
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:22,525
you're there, but it, and it
seemed. Hard and stressful, I

276
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,875
suppose, thinking about it ahead
of time. I mean, I know it did

277
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:28,404
right. And now I've changed like
7 billion, billion trillion

278
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:31,855
diapers, and it's like not a big
deal. Right. And, you know, so

279
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:35,785
it, so the idea of like leaning
back on previous experiences from

280
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:38,755
different fields and transferring
skills, even if they're not like

281
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:44,484
I don't have to change any
diapers here at the office. But,

282
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,644
but I have just like you were
saying, I've been through that

283
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:51,115
experience of like a thing seems
scary and unknown. And I was

284
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,904
like, and then I learned how to
do it. And then I did it a bunch

285
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:58,555
of times and now I'm like good at
it. And that's something it's

286
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,075
it's I love how you said that.
It's, it's like very important

287
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,914
and cool to be able to like, I
don't know when you're feeling

288
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:07,755
like that. Just to think back on
other things that you have, you

289
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,634
have done, you know, cause
everybody's any, even if you, I

290
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:13,464
mean, not even if, but if you
don't have kids, you're still

291
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:16,974
like a person who has moved
through life. So, uh, th there's,

292
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:20,325
there's lots of things to lean on
in that way,

293
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,883
Bekah: Yeah, I'm just kind of
like going down this path of, I,

294
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:26,212
you know, I wonder why it seems
like such a struggle for so many

295
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:30,712
people, um, to be moving into
careers as software engineers.

296
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:37,442
And I don't know if. It's, we
don't learn a ton of new stuff as

297
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:40,623
adults in the same way that we do
as when we're kids, right? Like

298
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:43,803
you're constantly learning
something new and everything

299
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:48,603
feels like a risk, but in adult
life, there are, I feel like

300
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,603
almost fewer of those risks,
because you've kind of like built

301
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,843
that up to this point. And I
don't know if that's what makes

302
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,863
it seem scary to move forward,
but it is like, you know,

303
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:04,428
essentially that idea of, you
know, Being afraid, or I don't

304
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,587
know if it's being afraid of
failure. It's probably different

305
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,018
for everyone. I guess it's being
afraid of failure for me. So

306
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:13,042
Sara: I would say it's probably
different for everyone. I mean, I

307
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:16,972
think that's a very valid
comparison as well too. And one

308
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:21,442
that I hadn't even thought of
yet, but as children, every new

309
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:25,432
day, every new life moment is
something new. We potentially

310
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:29,032
have never encountered it before.
Or, you know, we've played on a

311
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,643
playground before we fell off the
slide, you know? And now we're

312
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:35,613
just like, Oh, slides are scary.
Yeah. But then we go to a new

313
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:39,182
park and it's like, Oh, there's
another slide, but maybe that

314
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:42,573
slide's not scary. And that's
like a natural as children. We

315
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:45,692
don't think about that is, you
know, learning and leaning on

316
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:49,712
previous experiences to like
navigate current experiences. Um,

317
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:54,843
but we're trained to do that as
children and as we get to

318
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:58,441
adulthood, we may not do that as
much anymore. And is that because

319
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:03,145
we may stay in careers longer. I
don't, I don't know is that

320
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,026
because things are rapidly
changing in this industry that

321
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:09,056
it's like, I blink and there's
new framework and there's, here's

322
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:13,105
a new tool that I need to learn.
Um, or you have individuals like,

323
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,705
you know, us we're we're career
changers, you know, we're, we're

324
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,105
going from one industry to
another, and now we're navigating

325
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:23,486
a completely different set of
construct rules, everything. Um,

326
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:24,746
yeah,

327
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:28,105
Bekah: I feel like I love that
the whole, uh, the playground

328
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:31,526
just makes a lot of sense to me,
I think because you know, part of

329
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:34,226
that playground, I think if you
fall off that slide and you're

330
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:37,076
the only kid on the playground,
it's much harder to get back up

331
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:40,556
on that side. Right. But like you
see all these other kids and

332
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:43,046
they're doing it and that just
kind of gives you a little bit of

333
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:46,786
confidence. And for a lot of us
and a lot of people that we talk

334
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:51,016
to they're navigating the
transition into tech Oh alone,

335
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,546
whether they're self-taught or in
an online bootcamp. And there's,

336
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:59,836
you know, a lack of value placed
on community. But when you see

337
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:03,556
other people around you doing it,
like it does something, it gives

338
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:06,826
you the energy sometimes that you
need in those moments where you

339
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:11,645
feel like, wow, I, you know, like
fell off the slide and I need to

340
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,365
get back on.

341
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Sara: it's also important when
you have community, because I

342
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,205
have never. I've never succeeded
at a hard thing alone. Um, I've

343
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,076
always needed community in some
aspect, whether that was like a

344
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:27,566
micro circle of friends that I
leaned upon that just, I w I was

345
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:31,346
vulnerable to, or like Virtual
Coffee, a much larger community.

346
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:35,516
Um, using the playground as an
analogy, you know, as an example,

347
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:39,655
when you fall off that side, you
sometimes also need a person that

348
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:44,546
says, Hey, I'm scared to do the
slide again. Can you help me? And

349
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,415
you need to have a great
community and empathetic

350
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,615
understanding compassionate
community that doesn't laugh at

351
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,705
you because you're saying the
side is easy and the person

352
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,596
you're telling that to, it's just
like, Oh, this slide's not a big

353
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,816
deal. It's just, you know, it's
only two feet long. It's like,

354
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,326
no, we don't need that. You know,
we need someone that grabs your

355
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:07,736
hand says, Hey let's do it
together. And that's, that's

356
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:11,486
something that I've needed to
reach where I am and something I

357
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:15,026
will always need and will always
provide to other people.

358
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,319
Bekah: Yeah. And, you know, I
think that, you know, capturing

359
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:26,164
that idea of self doubt, being
such a big obstacle for career

360
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:30,125
changers and for new developers
and, you know, people who have

361
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,884
been in the industry for a long
time, but maybe are going up for

362
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,295
promotion or didn't get that
promotion. That's really hard to

363
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:40,595
navigate when, when you're by
yourself, you know,

364
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:46,704
Sara: Yes. Uh, even if you wanted
to potentially go ask somebody,

365
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:49,795
is this right? Can I get advice?
Can, can I have some mentorship

366
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:54,924
or can you just hold my hand when
I go get on this new slide? Um,

367
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:59,855
Nobody needs to do anything alone
and nobody needs to feel that

368
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:03,154
sense of isolation. we're all
learning. We're all doing this

369
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:03,515
together.

370
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,430
Bekah: Yeah. And I think too, you
know, this idea of like

371
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,250
leveraging your past, all this
stuff that you were saying about

372
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,339
that, that clicks for me here in
a lot of ways too, because I know

373
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:19,710
that sometimes when I'm afraid to
try something new, then I it's

374
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,680
important for me to lean on the
things that I know really well.

375
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,230
And it's leveraging that
experience or, you know, I, I

376
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,055
spent a while thinking like, I
taught English for 10 years and I

377
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:31,785
was a community organizer for a
little while. Like I want to run

378
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,244
from that. I don't want to do
that anymore. This is why I'm

379
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:37,944
making this transition. And
within the last, I don't know,

380
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:41,875
even a couple of months, I felt
like, you know what, leaning on

381
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:46,345
those things and, and remembering
what I've learned from that can

382
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:50,125
really benefit me from this, from
it in this moment. So it's not

383
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,545
like a rejection of that past.
It's like, let's embrace these

384
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:54,565
two things together.

385
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,019
Sara: Yeah. Yeah. And for me
personally, in those moments,

386
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:04,390
it's when I reflected on it after
the fact, it's helped me to

387
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:10,450
understand how far I've come as
well of just like, Oh, okay. Even

388
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,210
though this the situation, you
know, I, you know, in my job,

389
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,920
current job was, was new for me,
that thing in the past, you know,

390
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,964
my, my previous career helped me.
Like I've grown. Like it's a,

391
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:24,904
it's a metric to really say,
like, I I've, I've grown up, I'm

392
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:29,765
achieving things. Like I
recognized how much personal

393
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,515
growth I've had that I hadn't
really been aware of until I hit

394
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,605
a moment when I would have paused
a little bit more, I would have

395
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:40,068
had a little bit more self doubt
and, everything in my past is

396
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,598
helped me get to where I am now
and recognizing that I can use it

397
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,888
is very comforting.

398
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:49,031
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. And I
think, you know, sometimes it

399
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:52,912
takes a minute to get to that. I
think in a lot of circumstances

400
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:56,707
and that's hard. I don't know how
to teach that. Like, is there a

401
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,916
way to teach that? I think that
maybe you just have to discover

402
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,876
that for yourself, but I wish
that I could help more people

403
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:04,686
discover that

404
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,001
Sara: That's why there's
community it's to have people

405
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:12,352
around you that are your personal
cheerleaders that care, that will

406
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,751
remind you why you're awesome.
And remind you that you can do

407
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:22,751
the thing because you've done X
other hard thing. It's I think

408
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:27,852
community. It's there's no,
nothing really to teach. It's a

409
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,852
feeling it's a sense of
belonging. It's a sense of being

410
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:36,491
supported. It's a sense of, um,
being a powered as who you are

411
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:40,602
not because you need to learn X
or you need to learn Y. Like we

412
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:43,612
all need to learn X and we all
need to learn Y. We just have

413
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:48,501
different experiences that we can
leverage to find a solution. So

414
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,342
leverage them because. If you
learn X and you learn Y and

415
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,362
you're just like everybody else,
you're going to achieve the same

416
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:59,182
answer, potentially just as
everybody else, it takes diverse

417
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,362
backgrounds. It takes leaning
upon diverse previous experiences

418
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,902
and those transferable skills to
find new solutions to things, new

419
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:10,821
processes, you know, new features
for a product that potentially an

420
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,051
existing team had not thought of
before. It's these transferable

421
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:19,642
skills that bring diversity to a
team, you know, in regards to how

422
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:22,461
an individual approaches a
problem and finds the solution.

423
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:26,771
Bekah: Yeah. And so I feel like
there's a twofold problem here or

424
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:32,936
not a problem, but situation. I
don't know. So it's. In your own

425
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:36,987
mind thinking like I can leverage
this and then like the second

426
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:41,336
part of that is now, how do I
leverage that and get other

427
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,017
people to see

428
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:43,902
Sara: Yes. Right,

429
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:46,737
Bekah: I don't know. Do you have
any tips there that would

430
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:50,741
Sara: Uh be your authentic self.
Um, it has always worked for me.

431
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:57,352
I, I find embracing my past and
sharing what I've learned, hence

432
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:03,471
the random cow facts, uh,
happened Virtual Coffee. Um, As a

433
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:06,652
safe way to show everyone else in
the community, and those that I

434
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:10,701
interact with that, like my past
is still relevant. It's still

435
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:16,011
part of who I am. Um, and
embracing that and having

436
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,791
conversations around that
demonstrate some of these skills

437
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:24,021
to individuals. That's what sets
you apart from everybody else

438
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:27,561
right now? And that's you, that's
not something you can learn.

439
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:30,531
That's not, not a certificate
that you can achieve and then put

440
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:35,332
on a resume. It's it's, you know,
the fact that, you know, for an

441
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,471
ag tech company, I'm an
extremely, you know, good looking

442
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:44,152
candidate because I have.
Agricultural background. I have

443
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:47,961
knowledge that I can lean upon,
you know, and I have skillsets to

444
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,991
potentially better understand how
a farmer might use a particular

445
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:54,412
product, because, well, I worked
with that farmer and I, you know,

446
00:27:54,412 --> 00:28:00,021
I supported that farmer and, um,
it's those points that we need to

447
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:04,251
not hide and showcase. Um, I, I'm
struggling to remember a quote

448
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:07,882
that I saw on Twitter this
morning, but it was spot on, but

449
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:12,031
it was talking about leaning into
what makes you unique because if

450
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:16,382
you don't lean into it, somebody
else will. And that person will

451
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:20,402
be who gets set apart from
others. and I, I find that to

452
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,912
always be very true a for the
fact that it highlights my

453
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:27,332
transferable skills, it
highlights these additional

454
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:33,521
knowledge sets that could be very
beneficial to an employer, but it

455
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:40,767
also. Reminds me of who I am. And
why I'm, you know, I don't want

456
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:44,886
to say off, cause that sounds so
unhumble, but like, you know why

457
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,676
I am awesome. It's like, and it
makes me feel comfortable to be

458
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:54,336
myself more in communities that
it, it helps me to overcome the

459
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:57,571
negative feedback that I've heard
in the past of like, well, How

460
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,912
can you be a software engineer?
If you have a degree in dirt,

461
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:05,132
which is literally been what I've
been told, um, what can we now,

462
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,311
um, you can, you know?

463
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,711
Bekah: Do you go back and like
find those people and just send

464
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:14,622
them your resume. Is that, is
that what we're supposed to do?

465
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:21,071
Sara: isn't that what LinkedIn's
for mean? I don't know. Um, no, I

466
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:26,507
haven't, trust me the want's
there, um, But I did get to turn

467
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:31,596
down a job offer to an employer,
but I didn't quite, I wasn't

468
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,416
rude. Um, I, as much as I wanted
to say it just like, yeah, you

469
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,696
undervalued me and you gave me
stress for the fact that I didn't

470
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:40,237
have a CS degree. And, um, I'm so
sorry that I only have a

471
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,636
bachelor's and a master's degree
in another, you know, uh,

472
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:47,041
technical field. Apparently not
enough and not relevant for my

473
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:53,642
ability to somehow tell you that
I can learn a lot. But yeah, I

474
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,801
just said, no, I would like to

475
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,481
Dan: Seems like a good call,
maybe.

476
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,352
Sara: Tik Toks for that, you
know, where you just flex, like

477
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,612
overcoming those things,

478
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,061
Dan: I was thinking more like,
um, like mailing them a box of

479
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:08,112
dirt or something, you know?

480
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:09,701
Bekah: Okay.

481
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,461
Sara: wouldn't be dirt. It
wouldn't be

482
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,622
Dan: Well, sure. Right. Yeah. Cow
products.

483
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:19,217
Bekah: Bye. Oh, can we just get a
shade button on LinkedIn? Like I

484
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:19,606
would,

485
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:20,352
Sara: I know, right?

486
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,856
Bekah: that feature. Okay.

487
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:25,981
Dan: Yeah. Flex, flex button.
that. Okay.

488
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,688
Bekah: yeah, and I think, you
know, this idea of transferable

489
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:33,508
skills and really showing what
makes you unique and awesome. It

490
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:39,462
really. A good way to figure out
how to, I think, leverage that

491
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,133
maybe is really through
networking, right? Because you

492
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,972
can walk into a room full of
people. And if everybody is

493
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:50,502
talking about the same thing, Oh,
I made this to do app or

494
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:53,502
whatever, like that's great, but
who are they gonna remember?

495
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,143
They're gonna remember the cow
lady, right? Like.

496
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,147
Sara: Yeah. Yeah, I would, I
would agree with that. And, um,

497
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:07,548
that, that kind of is a little
bit of how I got my job now. I

498
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,117
reached out to Bryan Healey in
our Virtual Coffee community, um,

499
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:15,978
trying to get into the ag tech,
uh, side of things. Um, see if he

500
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:20,313
had any connections. Um, he
didn't really, um, but. You know,

501
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,623
it, it eventually turned into,
okay. Let's, let's talk about the

502
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,603
jobs that you're applying to.
Let's, let's, let's look at your

503
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:27,843
resume a little bit. Let's, let's
talk about these things. And the

504
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,573
conversation started to unfolding
more and more and more, as I

505
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:33,663
talked about what I've done and
things I built, um, both

506
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,512
personally professionally
processes I've, you know, made

507
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:41,363
and improved and it turned into
like, wow, okay. You, you might,

508
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:46,403
you know, not have two to five
years, you know, software

509
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,863
engineering experience, like
most, most jobs required. But I,

510
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:51,472
I recognize that you're a person
that I literally can throw into

511
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:57,883
the deep end and you're going to
swim. And I've done that. And I'm

512
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,883
happy as a clam that I get to
wear five hats at work. And I,

513
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:05,143
um, to have this, uh, what, what
was the phrase like to use the

514
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:08,143
fire hose of information to my
face constantly of just like what

515
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,482
is going on at work? What needs
to change? What needs to happen?

516
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:14,048
Things are moving so fast, but
I'm absorbing it all and I'm

517
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:18,577
loving it. And, um, it was that
networking that genuinely showing

518
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:23,048
up as my authentic self, talking
about my past, um, that really

519
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,147
helped me to showcase. I mean,
I'm not going to say that like

520
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:27,938
doing that, it's just going to,
you know, get you job offers to

521
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,417
everybody that you do that too,
but people will talk and you'll

522
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:35,528
get known as the cow lady. In
communities and they'll be like,

523
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:38,647
Hey, you know, I think she could
probably handle whatever you're

524
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,827
going to throw at her. So like
maybe go talk to her. and that's

525
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,448
what happens, you know?

526
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:47,573
Bekah: Yeah. When, like, since
you've been there, it's just

527
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,752
been, I feel like you've been
sprinting the entire time. Right.

528
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:54,143
Because I would love to like dive
a little bit into that timeline

529
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:56,962
because it was like, Oh, we're
going to hire Sara. Oh, she's

530
00:32:56,962 --> 00:33:00,292
awesome. We're going to hire her
more. Oh, she's awesome. We're

531
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:00,742
gonna.

532
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,167
Sara: Yeah,

533
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:03,952
Bekah: not yet, but that's like,
you know,

534
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,188
Sara: I threatened that. Um,

535
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:10,403
Bekah: but like walk through that
because that process is intense.

536
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:14,573
Right? You have accomplished so
much in a very short amount of

537
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,173
time there.

538
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:19,948
Sara: Yes. So I was originally
hired as a contractor, um, and

539
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:22,617
that was supposed to be for,
cause obviously hiring during

540
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:26,188
COVID it was, you know, strange
times and, um, there was a need,

541
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:30,188
but with the way things were
going, hiring was frozen in a lot

542
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:32,847
of places. And I was, I was happy
to just have an opportunity. I

543
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:35,758
was happy to like basically say,
Hey, you know? Yep. I'll prove

544
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:38,847
myself. You know, I'll work as a,
as a part-time contractor. That's

545
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:43,968
great. You know, that'll a, it
ultimately helps me, um, Add

546
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,692
something to my resume, get some
experience, uh, learn how to work

547
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:51,163
with a large, large team of much
more senior engineers. But it

548
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:56,742
also gave me a chance to prove
myself to the company. And if it

549
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:59,202
didn't end up transitioning into
a full-time job, which was the

550
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:02,623
ultimate goal, great, no harm, no
foul, you know, I still come out

551
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:08,023
of it with experience. Um, I
think that lasted a month. Um,

552
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:11,322
things went so well. Uh, there
was a need, they recognized that

553
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:15,253
I could fill the need. Um, there
was a conversation of like, okay,

554
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:18,373
we're immediately going to be
doubling your work hours. You

555
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:22,512
will responsible for X, Y, Z, and
one, two, three. And that was

556
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:26,983
fine. It was a little
intimidating, but what's the

557
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,733
worst thing I could do. Like get
some experience and like learn

558
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:35,922
how not to do a thing. Um, you
know, that was, that was how I

559
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:39,313
approached it. And. I ended up
transitioning to a full-time

560
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:46,032
employee and yeah. Um, startup
life is, is rapidly evolving.

561
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:50,472
Every day is chaos. I love it.
Some days are more chaos than

562
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:55,342
others. But I got comfortable
with my team really fast. Like I,

563
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:58,943
for a while, quite a while was
the most junior individual there.

564
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:01,432
Everybody knew each other.
Everybody had worked together for

565
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:07,612
years. But I just decided to just
have a one-on-one with everyone.

566
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:12,353
Talk to them, recognize they're
human recognize of who I could go

567
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:15,052
to, for what reason, for
questions. I specifically made

568
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:18,713
that a point in my one-on-ones
with everyone to say, if I have a

569
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:23,483
problem, what can you help me
with? Um, and I just started, I

570
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:27,103
just started doing things and I
just slightly leaned into I

571
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:31,842
guess, a phrase that I was taught
when I worked for the university

572
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:35,652
of was it's better to ask
forgiveness than permission. So I

573
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:37,362
would just start writing
documentation of just like, well,

574
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:40,362
this is lacking, this is missing,
you know, write this down because

575
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:43,152
I'm doing it. And it was the
perfect time. Um, and then I

576
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:46,753
started recognizing that, Oh, Oh,
this is somewhere that I can

577
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,182
really contribute because
documentation's kind of out of

578
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:52,032
date because everyone here has
already got their environment set

579
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:56,023
up. And like, you know, this is a
place that I can contribute. Um,

580
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,293
And then I started as I'm
learning and going through other

581
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:03,253
parts of our product and our
process, seeing things that just

582
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:09,135
need tweaked. And it started just
being a lot of tweaking and then

583
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:13,365
a lot of tweaking turned into,
okay, well, we're going to, we're

584
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:16,146
going to give you this part of
the product now. And you're gonna

585
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:19,065
own this and you're gonna learn
it and you're gonna be

586
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:24,215
responsible for it. And. Again,
process improvement, tweaking,

587
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,275
seeing what I could do or asking
questions, um, asking for

588
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:30,365
examples in, in the existing code
base, whenever I would need to do

589
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:32,916
a feature that I was just like, I
don't know. I don't know how you

590
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:36,485
want me to do this. Like never
done this before, but I'll figure

591
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:43,326
it out. Um, yeah. And now I'm in
charge of a team of people and

592
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:48,846
hiring, unfortunately, firing.
Um, that's not fun part by the

593
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:51,485
way. Doing a lot of
documentation, a lot of process

594
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:56,445
improvement. Yeah, I love it. And
it's, it's been nonstop and it's

595
00:36:57,346 --> 00:37:03,376
really started with kind of
leaning back on my agricultural

596
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:05,835
experience of like, when you show
up on a farm, the cows are not

597
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:09,076
going to tell you what's wrong.
You just stand there, look at it,

598
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:13,155
make a lot of observations, do a
little bit research, you know?

599
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,960
And then just start trying stuff,
see what works. Um, you might

600
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,090
have to MacGyver it. You might
have to get the baling twine out.

601
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,280
You might have to get the duct
tape out. You might have to like,

602
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:27,811
make it look ugly. So it works.
That's fine. You just might need

603
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:30,090
to fix the fence for five
minutes. Like, so the cows stay

604
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,541
in tomorrow. You're going to
refactor your code base and it

605
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,840
will be pretty efficient and
performance. And that's kind of

606
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:41,806
how I started. And. That's worked
very well for me. Um, I will say

607
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:45,615
there's no cows in our code base.
Um, but the process still works.

608
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:50,686
You know, I can do a thing that
achieves the feature and then

609
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:54,295
thankfully with the help of my
more senior team, over time,

610
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:57,905
I've, I've gotten better at
developing the proper style for

611
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:01,215
how I do things. So my naming, my
variables, uh, separating things

612
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,456
properly apart with how we're
currently doing it for code base,

613
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:08,326
all of these things. And it's
because I just dove in, because I

614
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:13,059
recognize that I've done this
before with farm animals when

615
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,559
they can't tell you what hurts,

616
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:16,724
Dan: a little bit of structured
YOLO

617
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,748
Sara: I've Structured YOLO. Oh my
gosh. Yes. I yes, it is always

618
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:22,559
structured YOLO.

619
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,498
Dan: Um, so Yeah, so I mean, that
was a lot, I mean,

620
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,228
Sara: Yeah.

621
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:31,539
Dan: you know, no, that was,
that's not what I meant, but I

622
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,878
just mean, like Bekah said, you
have accomplished so much, you

623
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,619
know, in, in what is it? Less
than a year? Something I,

624
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,579
Sara: yeah. Like seven months.

625
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,878
Dan: So one of the jumps in there
that you

626
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,778
Bekah: I just want to highlight
that Sara said seven months. So

627
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:50,168
all of that stuff that she said
she's done has been in the past

628
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:51,278
seven months.

629
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:52,539
Sara: I like

630
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,619
Bekah: deserved a moment.

631
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:58,318
Dan: That's what I meant by. That
was a lot. And, and, Yeah. so, I

632
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,898
mean, one of the, you kind of
like jumped over a little bit.

633
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:05,699
Um, but the going from like just
solely individual contributor

634
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,268
role to managing a team, um, for
me, it seems like a pretty big

635
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:14,059
step, And so I kinda remember you
talking about it when it happened

636
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,798
a little bit, but I was wondering
if you could talk a little bit

637
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:21,139
about like, what, what that was
like, how your job changed, how

638
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,728
you approached it, you know, that
kind of thing.

639
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:29,603
Sara: Yeah, absolutely. Um, it
was terrifying, um, because now I

640
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:32,943
recognize that, I'm responsible
for, uh, people, their

641
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:39,903
livelihood, you know, their jobs.
Um, and I think helping to hire

642
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:46,983
someone for our support team was
really how my company recognized

643
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:50,403
that, Oh, she can do this. Um,
cause I was the one that led the

644
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:52,833
interview. Um, I led all the
interviews for that particular

645
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:53,193
hire

646
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,594
Dan: So that was a hire. I'm
sorry to interrupt, but that was

647
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:59,253
a real, that was for a role that
was not your ma like that you

648
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,143
wouldn't be like, this is just a
separate role that,

649
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,574
Sara: yes, It was a separate
support role for our product and

650
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:12,454
they let me do the interview, um,
because I was learning this part

651
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,664
of the process product I was
going to be, um, being primarily

652
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:19,114
the person that they reported to,
even though I wasn't at that

653
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,423
point in time, uh, I guess I
don't see it designate their

654
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:24,693
supervisor or their manager. Um,
but I was just like the first

655
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:27,364
point of contact. So at that time
I probably would have been, you

656
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,164
know, a lead of some sort, I
guess, if you had to put a,

657
00:40:29,164 --> 00:40:32,824
really a term on it, but, um,
just the person that they went to

658
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:38,224
before I went to the next level.
Um, but yeah, it, I did an

659
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:44,929
interview. It, it went very well.
Um, I started, you know, touching

660
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:50,628
base with all of them. And it was
terrifying because now I have

661
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:56,059
seven people that look at me of
like, Hey, I need help with X or,

662
00:40:56,088 --> 00:41:02,449
um, my time sheets messed up or,
um, any, any other access issue.

663
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:06,753
Um, but I. I just kind of
approached it like I would

664
00:41:06,753 --> 00:41:09,454
anybody else in the community
that I'm in of just like, Hey, I

665
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:16,414
have a problem. Um, but I, I also
kind of took note of who they

666
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:19,384
were, you know, I networked with
them a little bit. I, I wanted to

667
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:23,764
know what their interests were,
um, what their overarching goals

668
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:28,414
were, uh, with, with the job
here, with their career, so that

669
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:31,773
I can understand is there, are
there opportunities internal that

670
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:36,364
I can. See them grow into and
that's happened quite a few. She

671
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:40,023
got quite a few times with our
agents. Um, can I help them grow

672
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:45,063
internally with their career? And
that's, that's terrifying. Um,

673
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:53,434
but it feels great because, um,
again, I structured YOLO. I just

674
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:57,619
did it and I, I remembered what
it was like to be an employee

675
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:02,148
somewhere of what I would like a
manager to do. And I recognize

676
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:06,349
that, you know, I might be
restricted in certain situations.

677
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,719
I can't make everybody have a
thousand dollars an hour, you

678
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,829
know, wage, even if I would like
them to. Um, but I can advocate

679
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:17,088
on their behalf to make sure that
they're, they're not, you know,

680
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,829
making less than they should. Uh,
I will always do that. Um, but it

681
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,478
was. I don't know, it was
terrifying at first. Um, but

682
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:30,018
I've, I've grown into it and
I've, I'm enjoying it and I'm

683
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:32,989
enjoying seeing them grow. And
I'm enjoying seeing them slide

684
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:37,278
into, you know, different roles
that they're, they're excelling

685
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:41,088
in and I'm enjoying that
relationship, um, that I have

686
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:44,838
with all of them. I feel like
I'm, I'm, I'm meandering now on

687
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:45,679
the, on the topic. So

688
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,119
Dan: No, no, no. This is exactly
what I

689
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,068
Sara: wrangle me back on topic.

690
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,579
Dan: no, no, this is, this is
exactly what I want to talk

691
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,994
about. I like the. This
transition from individual

692
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:02,143
contributor to manager is always
a interesting thing, you know?

693
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:06,344
Um, and, and so every, every time
we have somebody that has gone

694
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,804
through that, I, I ended up just
trying to dig in a little bit

695
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,023
because I liked to learn about
it. You know, I like hearing

696
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,903
about it. And, um, it's one of
those interesting things in our

697
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:17,309
industry where it's like, Lots of
times, it seems like there's just

698
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,119
a ceiling, you know, um, on how
far you can go as an individual

699
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,458
contributor and then like the
only choices management after

700
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,759
that, you know, um, which I w I
would say is not always true,

701
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:32,398
but, um, but I do like, right.
And, well, absolutely. And, um,

702
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:36,659
but I like hearing about like,
and sharing what that transition

703
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,068
is like, like what the difference
is,

704
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:38,358
Sara: yeah.

705
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:42,528
Dan: between, you know, between
the two, the two roles, um,

706
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,318
Sara: I definitely reached out a
lot. Um, either the individuals,

707
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:51,579
um, within the company of just
like, how do I navigate X

708
00:43:51,608 --> 00:43:54,369
situation? You know? How often
should I have one-on-ones, how

709
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,778
often should I do this process
with my team? Um, which was

710
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:02,193
incredibly helpful, but I also.
Looked to other individuals,

711
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:05,193
especially in that Virtual Coffee
community, um, who are managers

712
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:09,873
who onboard people, who, who, uh,
support new hires to just say

713
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:15,094
what is going well for you? Um,
and seeing if I can take that and

714
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:21,244
implement it internally, um, just
to be the best that I can at my

715
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:25,744
role, but also to support my
employees the best that we can.

716
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:32,148
Um, so being willing to. Take
advice from everywhere was, was

717
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:32,989
definitely helpful.

718
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,884
Dan: Yeah, I love that. Do you
find yourself writing like a lot

719
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,963
less code, like doing a lot less,
you know, IC kind of work.

720
00:44:43,074 --> 00:44:46,793
Sara: Oh yes. Um, just by the
very nature, I'm now busy with

721
00:44:46,793 --> 00:44:50,514
process improvement process, you
know, well creating there's some

722
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:54,744
processes that don't exist, um,
that we are creating now. Um, but

723
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:59,898
I actually. I focus more on
internal tooling, um, and just

724
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:03,378
ensuring that our tooling is
built, uh, and in a fashion that

725
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:06,889
can support our current processes
as well as any upcoming

726
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:11,478
processes, which is nice. Um, I
occasionally still implement

727
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:14,889
features within our product that
enable our current processes or

728
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:19,539
new processes to happen properly.
Um, so like I have minor changes

729
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:25,494
in our, in our existing code
bases now, but. Yeah, I do do

730
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:29,514
less coding and that's okay.
Because I recognize that my

731
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:35,123
strengths are potentially a
little bit more of, um, process

732
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:41,034
design, overseeing things,
product roadmaps, um, while still

733
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:44,963
being a technical individual. So
that's, that's where I see my

734
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:50,934
career going and I, I'm not sure.
Seven months ago, even a year

735
00:45:50,934 --> 00:45:54,623
ago. That I would have said that
that's where I wanted it to be.

736
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:57,054
Um, I would have been like, no, I
want to code all day long. Just

737
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,554
put me in a corner. Let me to
closet. Let me code the thing,

738
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:05,483
leave me alone. Give me coffee.
Um, yeah. So yay for growth all

739
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:05,784
around.

740
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:07,239
Dan: that's awesome.

741
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,824
Bekah: I mean, they're so
important because I think there

742
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:14,994
are so they're undervalued and
having someone who's new to the

743
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:18,414
process, who's new to a company.
I think that you can really see

744
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:21,443
those pain points like you were
talking about of like, okay,

745
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:25,583
well, you don't have this or this
is outdated. And then that allows

746
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:29,048
you to, you know, See things
differently than people who have

747
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:31,958
been doing it for a long time and
to create those things and

748
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,469
understand the needs of other
people. And I feel like how

749
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:39,248
fortunate people are, if they are
being managed by you, because you

750
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:43,418
have a real sense of like what
people need and a really great

751
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:47,739
pro approach to supporting those
people. And that's also something

752
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:51,639
that we just don't see nearly
enough of, um, from the

753
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:55,059
community, from the tech
industry. And I really feel like

754
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:59,244
in general, Um, what you were
talking about preschool earlier.

755
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:02,423
And I was thinking, you know,
schools just don't do a good job

756
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:04,043
of onboarding new families.

757
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:05,583
Sara: no, they don't

758
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:07,974
Bekah: It never occurred to me
until

759
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,003
Sara: be a product for that.

760
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:12,983
Bekah: exactly. Um, but like
parents will reach out to me and

761
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:15,713
be like, they're talking about
this thing. And I have no idea

762
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:19,373
what this thing means, but nobody
has explained it to me. Right.

763
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:24,159
And it is that. Understanding and
taking note of and grabbing that

764
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,298
feedback and like being willing
to ask questions that, you know,

765
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:33,128
you might be afraid to ask, but
that creates those processes that

766
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:38,619
allow for a really, um, great and
successful work environment.

767
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,619
Sara: Yeah, I think something
that's always really served me

768
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,869
well, and it's something I always
try to keep in mind is

769
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:50,489
recognizing that. All processes
have a human element to them. So

770
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:55,179
there's human processes in this.
And when you think about, you

771
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:58,539
know, designing, uh, you know,
even a job description or

772
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,079
designing processes for current
employees, like you have to take

773
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,068
into account that there's a human
doing this, and you need to

774
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:10,628
support the human side through
this because you can write

775
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:13,869
amazing documentation, but it's
written from a place of

776
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,063
understanding. And then we bring
somebody new through the

777
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:19,853
documentation. They're going to
have a lot of questions and you

778
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,384
need to make sure that you
address the fact that they're

779
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:23,813
going to feel confused, that
they're going to need to have

780
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:27,143
questions. You need to identify,
you know, who to go to for

781
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,963
questions and, and recognizing
that there's a human element to

782
00:48:29,963 --> 00:48:35,603
this and supporting the human
element. Um, I think really

783
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:41,634
creates a great cohesiveness and
teams to a have good

784
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:46,373
communication because we
recognize that. We're all humans.

785
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,164
Um, and that we have human
feelings about things when they

786
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:56,094
change. Um, but it just creates
more compassion and empathy in

787
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:59,873
regards to like, if someone has a
bad day of like, you know, Hey, I

788
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:02,423
recognize I've changed this
process on you. I recognize it's

789
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:05,514
new. You, you were doing it. You
know, the old way, potentially as

790
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:10,403
an example, like there's nothing
to be upset about. Like. That's

791
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:13,193
fine. We're human. Like I have
bad days. I forget what the new

792
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:18,233
process is. I, I forget things.
Always having that human centered

793
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:23,184
approach to everything you do,
whether it's product development,

794
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:26,184
whether it's engineering, whether
it's process development, whether

795
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:29,063
it's management, having the human
centered approach is so

796
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:33,938
important. And. Can easily be
forgotten because we just get our

797
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,728
heads. So in the weeds and we get
blinders on and we're just like

798
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:39,909
just process oriented and I just
need to do the thing. And we're

799
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:42,728
not robots. There's a human
element to it. We always have to

800
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:43,179
respect that.

801
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:48,778
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I love
that. The what a great way to end

802
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,958
this podcast, the human centered
approach and why that's so

803
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,829
important. Um, I want to thank
you so much for being here with

804
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:59,639
us. This is really great. I know
I was like taking notes as we

805
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:04,369
were going through the podcast
and, um, so. Uh, it's been really

806
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,608
great to hear you talk about all
of these things and see how far

807
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:11,028
you've come and just like really
be an inspiration for, I know so

808
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:13,789
many people in the community, but
anybody who listens to this,

809
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:18,079
because there's just so much
growth that you went over in this

810
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,938
episode, and it's like a great
source of energy and empowerment,

811
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:24,708
I think coming here today.

812
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,208

Dan: I just also say, thanks. I
mean, this was, this was great. I

815
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,809
knew it was going to be great,
you know, but like, I don't know,

816
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:37,358
it was, it was very, very fun and
always. Just a pleasure. I feel

817
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:40,028
like I miss you in breakout rooms
every time. So, you know, I'm

818
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:42,188
going to have to force my way
into one of your breakout rooms.

819
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:42,998
One of these days,

820
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:46,764
Sara: See me get on a soapbox.
That'd be great.

821
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,778
Dan: energy. I almost interrupted
before you, you were saying about

822
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:53,259
soapboxes. I'm like, I love when
Sara gets on her soapbox. It's

823
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,079
one of my favorite things. So
thank you for, uh, thanks for

824
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:56,349
