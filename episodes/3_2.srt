00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:08,016
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode two of the

2
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,660
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,304
that

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,025
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,315
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,605
their

7
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:22,216
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:23,595
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

9
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:24,974
share it with

10
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:28,185
you here with me today is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,634
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today we are
joined by Abby Perini, a full

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:36,685
stack web developer, and a
delightful human being about the

13
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,485
impact building and public has
had on her developer journey.

14
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,255
Uh,

15
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:43,405
what our experience as a
recruiter taught her and how

16
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:46,545
rehearsing before an interview
can actually make a big impact.

17
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,655
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

18
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:52,115
Virtual Virtual Coffee we
introduce ourselves with our

19
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:55,865
name, where we're from, what we
do and a random check-in

20
00:00:55,865 --> 00:01:00,066
question. Today's question is,
would you rather be stuck on a

21
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,665
broken ski lift or a broken
elevator? We hope you enjoy this

22
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:16,248
episode. my name's Bekah. I am a
front end developer from a small

23
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:21,798
town in Ohio. And if I had to be
stuck on a broken ski lift or

24
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,898
broken elevator, it depends if
we are allowed to add conditions

25
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,998
to

26
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:29,298
that, I really do not like
heights. So I would not want to

27
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,248
be stuck up very high.

28
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:31,507
Abbey: Yeah.

29
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,737
Bekah: I feel like I've seen
enough movies where you can

30
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,425
escape a broken elevator. So if
I had to choose between a high

31
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,962
ski

32
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:47,453
lift or broken elevator, I would
MacGyver it out of the elevator.

33
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:54,162
Dan: Um, yeah, that's, that's a
good point about escaping it.

34
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,523
It's like, but I feel like
that's also like bad guys can

35
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,513
come in

36
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,132
that way too and stuff, you
know? So you

37
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,843
Bekah: Are there bad guys in
this scenario? Because.

38
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,703
Dan: Well, you got to always be
ready, but I mean, if you're

39
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,503
stuck in an elevator, then, you
know, bad guys are probably

40
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,112
coming, you know, that's just
like one of the things

41
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,157
Bekah: I think I still would
rather be in an elevator than a

42
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,677
high ski lift with bad guys. How
do you get out of that?

43
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:15,277
Dan: Oh, I mean, if you're stuck
on a ski lift and there's bad

44
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:17,587
guys around, you just stay there
cause they can't get to you, but

45
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:18,997
the elevator, they can just go
down

46
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:25,587
Bekah: Why can't bad guys get to
you on a ski lift climb

47
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,237
downloads. You have thing

48
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:30,657
Dan: Uh, oh yeah. You mean like,
oh, hand over hand, like monkey

49
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:33,657
bars kind of like scoot down.
Well, you'll be able to see them

50
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:34,258
coming along the way.

51
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,218
Bekah: I wonder, like if you had
a shirt and you wrapped it

52
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,358
around

53
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,427
the ski lift thing, can you
slide down?

54
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:40,562
Abbey: like a zip line.

55
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:43,777
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. Can you make
a zip-line that I might

56
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,612
Abbey: that's making your case
for the escaping the ski lift

57
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:46,793
though.

58
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:51,098
Bekah: Yeah. Well, I might be
okay if I could make a zip line,

59
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,217
then I might be okay with trying
to escape the ski lift.

60
00:02:55,112 --> 00:03:00,182
Dan: Um, all right, we're going
to move on. Uh, I'm Dan, I am a

61
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:03,902
front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio. And, um, yeah,

62
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:08,733
so my answer is ski lift for
sure. Um, I've actually jumped

63
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:12,233
off a stuck ski lift before, uh,
when I was snowboarding, um, we,

64
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,332
we were like kind of close-ish
to the thing. And we were in the

65
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,522
part where like the snow had
been it, a big pile of like

66
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,202
loose

67
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:24,032
snow. And so we, we just like
toss our boards off and. Uh, in

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,197
high school. And so I have
escaped the stuck, stuck ski

69
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,362
lift

70
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,693
before. So, um, that's easy, but
yeah, I mean, going back to the,

71
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:32,902
the, like the bad guys and
stuff, it's like the visibility

72
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,111
thing is

73
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,992
really my, you know, if you're
stuck, you just kind of know

74
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:38,762
what's going on, but you're
stuck in an elevator. You can't

75
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:39,662
see

76
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,703
anything there's just buttons.
And you don't know if it's a

77
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:43,623
computer that's stuck or like a
mechanical thing or whatever.

78
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,543
And

79
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:49,293
you're just in a little box. And
I feel like my guess is that

80
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:52,907
movies have misled all of us.
The panel that's up there in the

81
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,207
ceiling, you know, in every
movie. Cause I've looked up, you

82
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,872
know, sometimes in elevators you
look up and there's never a

83
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,537
panel

84
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:03,737
like that. So, I mean, it's
possible. I'm just going in the

85
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,427
wrong elevators,

86
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:05,723
Bekah: and elevators. You just
got to take that drop ceiling

87
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:06,848
and

88
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:10,647
Dan: maybe, maybe, but also we
all just know that movies, you

89
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:10,888
know,

90
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:12,543
Abbey: they do

91
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:13,828
Dan: lie about that sort of
thing.

92
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,423
Abbey: They lie about a lot of
things.

93
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:19,468
Dan: My, uh, Ben asked me like,
how do people fall on bananas?

94
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:19,978
Because.

95
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:20,528
Bekah: Okay.

96
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,433
Dan: He saw it in curious
George, I think. And I'm like,

97
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,458
well, you

98
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,808
know, they're kind of squishy
and stuff or whatever, but also

99
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,158
like,

100
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:31,788
literally I've never seen that
happen in my entire life

101
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:35,502
Bekah: peel, not, not going to
lie. I've got enough kids that I

102
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,023
believe I have fallen on a
banana peel in is slippery.

103
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:38,838
Dan: I'm just

104
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,752
Bekah: So can confirm you, just
let them know.

105
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,117
Dan: movies, like bananas. I can
see bananas being slippery, but

106
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,908
just like, as a reg, as like a
thing that always happens, you

107
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:48,108
know, it's like,

108
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,757
Abbey: It's not as frequent as
movies would leave. You lead you

109
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:51,908
to

110
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:52,947
Dan: Right. Exactly.

111
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,858
Abbey: And on that note, I'm
Abby, I'm from Atlanta. I'm a

112
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,737
full stack web developer on
month, two of my first developer

113
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:04,627
role. And, uh, I have also been
stuck on a ski lift before, so

114
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:08,798
I'm going to pick ski lift, um,
and I've seen enough horror

115
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:13,088
movies to never pick elevator
like that. The whole pregnant

116
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,648
lady walks into an elevator
she's immediately giving birth.

117
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,208
That's.

118
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,028
Bekah: I feel like I would Excel
in that situation. I would

119
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:19,898
deliver that baby.

120
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,413
Abbey: You would, I believe it
you're a champion

121
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:26,163
Dan: if the question is, would
you rather help a baby be

122
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:28,833
delivered on a stuck ski lift or
a stuck elevator? I'm going to

123
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,463
Abbey: then we're Yeah. we're
voting elevator because movies

124
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:34,192
have led us to believe, but it
happens perfectly fine

125
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,483
Dan: that'll work out. Yeah,
right. Um, I would, I don't

126
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,377
Bekah: It would be hard to catch
a baby in a ski lift. Yeah.

127
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:41,903
Abbey: Can confirm..

128
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,052
Dan: yeah, that's what I'm
saying.

129
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,442
Abbey: I just, yeah, I also
don't like Heights, but for some

130
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:46,717
reason, ski lifts are fine.
Cause like you're strapped into

131
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:47,992
the

132
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:52,103
chair and you're just swinging
in the cold air. Well, no one is

133
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,052
coming to rescue You It's fine.
I was not close to the ground

134
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,001
and

135
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:59,333
also like eight. So it was not
happening. We just got to

136
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,642
experience the views for a very
long time.

137
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:05,257
Bekah: It's like, what is a
Ferris wheel? Right? Like if

138
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:06,727
you're ever on a Ferris wheel
and then they're unloading the

139
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,197
Ferris

140
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:12,278
wheel and you get stuck at the
top forever. I don't like that.

141
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,963
That's that's enough. I could
probably climb down a Ferris

142
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:16,442
wheel. I

143
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:19,793
Abbey: I panicked on one of the
swingy boats one time and like

144
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:24,112
the older I get the closer to
the ground, my vertigo kicks in,

145
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:27,713
which is very unfortunate. And I
know my aunt has it. So I'm

146
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:28,072
screwed.

147
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,093
Bekah: Oh,

148
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:29,887
Dan: no.

149
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:31,403
Abbey: Um,

150
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:37,533
Bekah: well, welcome to the
podcast. went through 10

151
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,452
different versions of that
question. So now everyone is

152
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:41,371
very

153
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:44,192
well versed in how we would
respond to various scenarios of

154
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:44,463
that,

155
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,163
Abbey: thought about all the
angles

156
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:52,632
Bekah: all of them. Um, so we
would love to start by exploring

157
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:55,032
your origin story, how you got
to this point, what you have

158
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,432
done

159
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:58,723
and where you're at now.

160
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,887
Abbey: This is funny. Cause like
once a week, Kirk is like your

161
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,747
origin story just keeps growing
because

162
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:03,843
Bekah: Yeah.

163
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,177
Abbey: I have a lot of hobbies
of dabbled in a lot of things.

164
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,496
Um,

165
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,283
Bekah: about being a DJ. And I
did not see that on anything

166
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,033
that

167
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,983
I've seen about you. So that is
new to me.

168
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:16,687
Abbey: Yeah. I did. Uh, I was on
WSPF FM, Clemson for about three

169
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,652
and a half years. Um, did a
bunch of cool shows. I have an

170
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,617
award.

171
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:25,562
That wall for like most unique
radio show because we did radio

172
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:29,913
plays, but that's not my origin
story for programming. Um, so

173
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,233
let's see, I had been working in
recruiting the recruiting

174
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,142
industry and for the recruiters
out there, I did high volume MSP

175
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:42,153
recruiting for five years. Um,
and about year two or three, I

176
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:45,572
was like, okay, well, it doesn't
look like I'm going to be the

177
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,733
manager of a team anytime soon.
Cause we're not growing like

178
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:53,192
that. And it also. Doesn't look
like I'm getting anything I want

179
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,692
outside of the company, because
my resume being a psychology

180
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,987
major with a minor in economics,
just kind of sales roles and

181
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,282
MLMs

182
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:06,062
is what comes up. So I started
applying within the company and

183
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,855
like seeing if I could find
anything outside the company.

184
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,648
And

185
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:15,617
by March, 2020, um, I had been
rejected from a role I knew

186
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,557
inside the company that I knew
was like the best way for me to

187
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:23,057
move within the company. And I
was perfectly qualified and I

188
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,608
wasn't getting anything. So it
had become very clear that I

189
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:28,463
needed to do. Something else,
like I needed to get training or

190
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:31,552
something. And I had been
looking at data science and full

191
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,602
disclosure. I'm not great at
math that looked like you needed

192
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:40,462
another degree. So I got of
stalled out there. And then my

193
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,253
husband said, well, what about
web development? Like, you're

194
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,128
good at making things pretty.
You like colors, you'll move a

195
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:47,003
box

196
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:51,653
pixel by pixel. I can tell that
already. And I was like, yeah,

197
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,898
you know, all right. So I
started looking and there was a

198
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:54,143
bootcamp.

199
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:57,482
That kind of checked all the
boxes. Cause with the data

200
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,222
science boot camps, I already
had a list of questions that

201
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,962
would

202
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,612
fail a bootcamp. Like you're not
getting my money. Do the

203
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:04,262
teachers

204
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:09,332
care about the students? No. Are
probably not doing that. And uh,

205
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,783
so I, I w I was talking to Dan
before the podcast started about

206
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:17,643
how I used to be very much a
planner. So, um, I was like, all

207
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:21,243
Right. well, it's March. I got
in, I'm going to do this. And.

208
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:23,627
October, I'm gonna start
studying this pre-work that they

209
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,307
gave me,

210
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,567
which was like pretty in depth.
I spent six months doing all of

211
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,827
the

212
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:31,307
pre-work, which no one else did
no one, no one else even looked

213
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,767
at the pre-work as far as I
know. So by the time I walked

214
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,227
into the

215
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:40,307
bootcamp, I knew HTML, CSS,
Python, and synchronous

216
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:45,498
JavaScript. And, uh, we started
with going back through Python.

217
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:50,493
And then HTML and CSS. And then,
uh, we started into async

218
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:53,793
JavaScript and then like, you
know, react. We did some, uh,

219
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:59,868
templating before react, stuff
like that. Um, And during the

220
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:03,138
bootcamp, when I thought I was
going to be like, you know, it

221
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,807
was it front end and like, you
know, passable at everything

222
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,607
else, I guess. Cause I don't,
I'm an overachiever. I knew I

223
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,407
was

224
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:14,567
going to at least pass. Um, it
turned out that I just love

225
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:17,028
programming. Like I love
full-stack. I love everything

226
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,268
from back to front I, anything,
anyone tosses at me is just

227
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:25,822
another puzzle to solve and. I
just, you know, the relief that

228
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,337
floods in when you take a leap
like that. Cause I quit my job

229
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:28,852
in

230
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:33,263
August, 2020 after this is not
the most coherent version of my

231
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,407
backstory, but after a man
argued with me about the date of

232
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,551
the day

233
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,457
we were experiencing currently
in the same time zone, via

234
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,362
email,

235
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:45,263
which has the date in it, he was
like, No. you're wrong. Your

236
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:46,583
candidates not getting an
interview. You're you're

237
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,903
talking.

238
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:50,508
The wrong day. And I was like,
no, I'm not,

239
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:51,653
Dan: Oh, no.

240
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,397
Abbey: I'm really not. And, uh,
so then I moved the bootcamp up

241
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,056
a

242
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,592
month and quit my job, um, in
the bootcamp, obviously

243
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:02,117
everything

244
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:05,837
loved it. And then, um, the
founder had actually challenged

245
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:09,018
us to write four blog posts. By
the time we were done with

246
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,643
bootcamp, which was four months
long. And. Again, overachiever.

247
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,268
I

248
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:17,597
was like, thank you for
personally giving me a goal. And

249
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:22,128
I started writing blogs. And the
first one that I was like, oh,

250
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,317
people actually seem to like the
blogs I'm writing was an

251
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,057
animated

252
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:29,927
CSS button that I was just like,
oh, I love animated CSS buttons.

253
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,597
Look, you click it. It moves.
Isn't this great everyone. And

254
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,527
everyone was like, you know
what? This actually is kind of

255
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,457
great.

256
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:39,378
And I was like, oh, great. And
kept running. And then I think

257
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:43,217
around the time that I joined
Virtual Coffee was when I had my

258
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:48,618
portfolio. I had that blog get
top seven on dev Tio, all that

259
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:51,947
stuff, and just completely blown
away because it's just literally

260
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:54,798
just me being like, I love
programming. Oh, I'm going to

261
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,918
write a blog about this thing
that I like about programming or

262
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,038
the one that is, has the most
like staying power is the one

263
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,618
where I was like, there's not a
straightforward example of this

264
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:08,567
anywhere. It's react. Here have
an example with Shebaz in it.

265
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:13,893
That's my goal to put more
Shebas and programming. Uh, it

266
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:18,288
took. Me

267
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:22,577
about three months to get a job
after graduating bootcamp. And I

268
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:27,648
did that almost exclusively
through, uh, networking, um, the

269
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:32,748
blog building in public, um,
which I recommend. And, uh, mark

270
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:36,437
Noonan who's part of Virtual
Coffee, looked at my stuff and

271
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,827
was like, oh, You're doing
great. And, um, I went through

272
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,217
an

273
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,418
interview process with him and,
uh, when I posted my website

274
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,158
itself on LinkedIn, that also
got like 8,000 views on

275
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,898
LinkedIn,

276
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:50,048
which I don't know where that
stands in ACA in LinkedIn stats.

277
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,387
But, uh, my old boss saw it and
that's how I have my current

278
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:54,697
role

279
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:58,957
because she put my, uh, resume
back in the cycle of my old

280
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:03,378
company. And now I'm working. I
quit in August 22. I was a

281
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:05,027
recruiting admin. Technically my
title is talent services

282
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,676
manager,

283
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:12,018
and I joined Ronstadt again in
April as a software application

284
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,687
developer, which is pretty
awesome.

285
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,668
Dan: That that's very awesome.
It's um, I love that the, the

286
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:23,528
bootcamp was, was helping you
with the goal of, you know,

287
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,618
writing blogs and stuff, because
I think that's, I don't hear

288
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:31,248
about that very often. And, um,
some of the. People that I've

289
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,912
talked to, um, over the last
year or whatever that have come

290
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,397
out of

291
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,807
bootcamps. Um, the, the ones
that I feel like the ones that

292
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,216
I've

293
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,697
had a lot of success, uh, have
parents that like a lot of their

294
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:44,177
learning with writing. Um, and
it's been pretty cool.

295
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,852
Abbey: They also did. Um, like
you had to have your LinkedIn up

296
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,292
to date, you had to have a
resume that was, uh, applicant

297
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,732
tracking

298
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:54,812
system compatible, that kind of
stuff, which is good. Uh, I wish

299
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:58,352
we had done more algorithms or
they had told me that I could

300
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:02,373
just not do algorithms for
interviews. I just turned down

301
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,243
interviews with algorithms.

302
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,658
Dan: Did you yet? So that was,
did you run into that a lot when

303
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:09,557
you were interviewing.

304
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,528
Abbey: Yeah. I cried every
single time someone sent me a

305
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,908
time

306
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:17,467
browser ID algorithm, and like I
can program, I can build things.

307
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,077
I, if you and I, if the three of
us sat down and you were like,

308
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,207
Abby, we need to write an
algorithm together. I'd be like,

309
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,778
yeah. Okay. Let's do it. If you
send me a link, it has a timer

310
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:27,638
and it's an algorithm. I just
cry.

311
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:32,628
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, I can totally
see that. I mean, the, the timer

312
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:36,168
like kicking off of the wrong,
the wrong chemicals in your

313
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:36,557
brain,

314
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,277
Abbey: Yeah. And like, I think
we did, I think we were supposed

315
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,717
to

316
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:43,288
do it every Friday and we just
ended up doing like a handful of

317
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:44,668
days. We were supposed to solve
some algorithms and I was

318
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,048
solving

319
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:50,250
them. Uh, fast. They weren't
like really good at doing things

320
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,452
fast,

321
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,552
but they were solved and I
thought that was sufficient. And

322
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:58,562
then it would be like, here's
the first step of an interview

323
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,832
process. You desperately want
this job for some reason you're

324
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:05,102
terrible at this thing that has
nothing to do with the job that

325
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:09,842
you're trying to get. Uh, it's
just, you know, C feel that real

326
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,413
hard. And the February, the dark
February before I found Virtual

327
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,993
Coffee and I was just sitting in
my house unemployed during the

328
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:16,592
pandemic.

329
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,197
Dan: You mentioned that you wish
somebody told you, you could

330
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:21,457
just

331
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:25,327
turn down interviews that have
those, is that advice you would

332
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,187
give to people like now that
you've kind of been through it a

333
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:27,638
little bit,

334
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:29,658
Abbey: Yeah. definitely. If you,
if you like, if it's just a

335
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,548
cycle

336
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:35,357
of you failing, don't engage in
that cycle. Like, uh, the two

337
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:38,418
offers I got, neither of them
required me to do a time

338
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:42,423
algorithm and. Like that just
may be that you do a lot more

339
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:45,273
networking than you do, uh,
throwing your resume into the

340
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,537
void, which you know, is, you
know, better. I'm not, I've got

341
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,801
a

342
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:52,052
whole blog out there that says
that you can do the throwing

343
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,492
resume into the void thing. It
is possible. I've seen people

344
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:54,932
get

345
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:57,062
seen many people get jobs that
way. They also apply to

346
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,772
somewhere

347
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,842
between 400 and a thousand jobs.
So.

348
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,913
Dan: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

349
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,783
Bekah: A really good point to
make, because I think that there

350
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:11,023
are so many different approaches
and you have so much different

351
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,643
information coming at you about
what the interview process

352
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,263
should

353
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:19,413
look like. And. Plenty of people
out there that there that say,

354
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:21,633
oh, learn how to code in three
months and then you'll have a

355
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,913
job. Right. And maybe that
happened for them, but that

356
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,802
certainly is not the story for
most people. And so talking

357
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,691
about

358
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,402
that and talking about, you
know, turning down interviews,

359
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,112
like

360
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:33,363
that's scary for a lot of people
or at least shifting your

361
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,613
mindset

362
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:38,867
to, um, it's not. It's a
practice interview, right? Like,

363
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,091
I'm going

364
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,302
to go into this because I need
practice interviewing and if

365
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,393
something happens great, if it
doesn't I got practice. Right.

366
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:53,613
Abbey: Yeah. One of my mentors,
Asana was like, it's a. It's

367
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,802
every interview is practice for
the one that works. It's exactly

368
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:58,143
like sports. Like you're just
like pretend it's the one every

369
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,472
time, but this is also practice
for the time that it actually

370
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:06,407
works. And, uh, I had another
point about. Oh, Yeah. I had, I

371
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,887
had the privilege to go to a
bootcamp and quit my job. And my

372
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,397
husband was like, it's okay if
you don't get a job immediately.

373
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,887
But I was putting a lot of that
pressure on myself. So I was

374
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,738
extremely desperate for jobs. So
that's coming from someone that

375
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:23,028
knows the pain, but B had the
option to do it this quickly and

376
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:26,897
do it in this manner. Like if I
didn't have that, I definitely

377
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:29,327
would be like, okay. Yeah. Just
start teaching yourself to code,

378
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,877
start building, start building
in public and expect it to take

379
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,799
years. But I like stuff I put
out on the internet. I got job

380
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,721
offers

381
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,873
from startups for that. Knitting
is programming job or knitting.

382
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,822
Knitting is programming blog.
Like you never know it's luck

383
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:44,771
and

384
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,913
timing, especially.

385
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,827
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. Go ahead, Dan.

386
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:53,262
Dan: yeah. Luck in timing. But
also, I mean, also the, I don't

387
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:56,083
know exactly what the right word
is, but sort of consistency of,

388
00:17:56,292 --> 00:18:00,153
of doing the, like actually
applying the learning. Um, like

389
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,758
you said, and I suspect that
some people, um, wait on that

390
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,363
part,

391
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:08,303
wait on blogging because they're
still learning or because they

392
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,532
maybe feel like they don't, um,
have anything new to, you know,

393
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:19,522
like to talk about or, or, um,
or whatever. But my, I just love

394
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:21,742
seeing people like, like either
have come through and we're

395
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,632
blogging just like from the
start and. Actually leaning into

396
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:25,522
the

397
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,073
learning right. And learning in
public part. Um, because it's,

398
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:31,147
it's great. And I, it, it
expands your borders. It helps

399
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:33,832
you learn.

400
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,103
Um, and like I said, the
networking and everything like

401
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,333
that, it just kind of comes
along for free. Right. When

402
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,563
you're,

403
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:41,722
when you're, when you're doing,
putting the work in. Um,

404
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,137
Abbey: And when you joined the
Virtual Coffee,

405
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,053
Dan: And when you joined Virtual
Coffee,

406
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,373
Abbey: The Sheba counter blog. I
referenced earlier. My thought

407
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,732
when I hit publish was man, I
just really hope I don't sound

408
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,303
like a, like a really dumb book
enter or something. And like,

409
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,833
people are learning from that.
Like, you don't have to be.

410
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,952
Perfect. You don't have to be a
senior. You don't have to be an

411
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:07,752
expert. Just start writing, just
start putting it out there. And

412
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:09,712
like when, um, I, I struggle
with confidence. That's the

413
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,662
reason

414
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:13,793
that I was able to give a whole
talk and blog on what, like how

415
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,923
I

416
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,368
built up the confidence for the
job search. And the first thing

417
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:20,813
I

418
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,423
did was I applied. I started
applying to developer jobs. I

419
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,883
didn't even have a portfolio. I
didn't have an ATS compatible

420
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,492
resume. I was immediately
rejected and I was like, oh,

421
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,212
that's the worst? Application
I'll ever do. I was wildly

422
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,063
under-qualified. I had no idea
what I was doing. So now every

423
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:38,992
application after that slightly
better doing great. And it was

424
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,362
the difference I saw between
when my resume had a portfolio

425
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,732
that

426
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:47,123
was a template. And when Myers
may had a portfolio that I wrote

427
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,238
was really impressive. And like,
I've heard that from other

428
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:50,903
people

429
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,508
and that doesn't, it doesn't
have to be a perfect portfolio,

430
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,113
but

431
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:58,238
they'll look to see whether or
not you. Built it, if you're a

432
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,877
web developer, that's, that's
the copy. I have, I am my web

433
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:01,417
developer.

434
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:03,932
Dan: Yeah,

435
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:09,607
Bekah: I think that, I don't
remember. I was going to say.

436
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,807
Abbey: I definitely have to
like, be like, okay, here are my

437
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:14,377
points.

438
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:17,262
Dan: So what kind of things did
you put on your portfolio when

439
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:19,992
you were like, when you were
first applying when you were

440
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:20,742
applying for jobs?

441
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,803
Abbey: So I had four projects
that I had to do for bootcamp.

442
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,222
Um, I S I started seriously
applying when I had three on

443
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:33,573
their belief. Maybe we did five
projects. There was one that I

444
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:36,032
didn't include because I wasn't
happy with the result and it was

445
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:43,837
a group project. Um, so I have.
For a while until I had my

446
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:49,807
portfolio, I did just a straight
here's an, uh, an old nineties

447
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:57,728
XML site converted to a HTML CSS
site, like pixel for per pixel.

448
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,798
And then like, here's how I made
it responsive. Here's how I did

449
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,832
this, which was like a side.
Like a, like an extra assignment

450
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:05,866
that

451
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,067
they had given us that not many
people did, because I was like,

452
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,267
I

453
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,238
know basic issue your own CSS.
I'll just do all the fun stuff.

454
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:17,958
It was that, uh, and, uh, then I
think it was all react to

455
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,508
projects. Yeah.

456
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:21,952
Bekah: Yeah.

457
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,458
Dan: that's cool. I was just
asking, because I was, I don't

458
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,817
have like a portfolio at all and
like, I'm not, I'm not applying

459
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:34,167
for jobs or anything right now,
but I never even know what kinds

460
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,097
of things go on them anymore.

461
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,423
Abbey: Yeah, I mean, if you've
built something and you're like

462
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:43,782
this shows, well, I mean, we can
go into how I pitch your

463
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:47,292
experience to employers, but
like, uh, yeah. As long as it's

464
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,992
something is like, this shows
that I can do this technological

465
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:50,593
concept,

466
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:51,518
Dan: I guess my,

467
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:52,452
Abbey: go on your portfolio.

468
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:56,167
Dan: point was, was going to be
if I was, and this is true, the

469
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,508
first time I hired a junior, um,
and it was back up, but like

470
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,758
the,

471
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,337
that I don't, I have no idea if
he even had a portfolio at that

472
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:06,337
point, or if I looked at it or
not, but I definitely looked at

473
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:09,397
the blog. This is what I mean,
like. Projects that you do in

474
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:12,248
school or in boot camp and stuff
are like good. And, you know,

475
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,528
it's good to share, but if you
have like writing about those

476
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,613
projects, that is like, you
know, tied with the portfolio,

477
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:18,698
um, or

478
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,397
just that are happened to be on
your blog, you know, that's

479
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:24,553
Abbey: I don't know that my
current employer even looked at

480
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:28,603
my blog. I got asked in-depth
questions about every single one

481
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:28,722
of my

482
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:29,938
Dan: your, your current,

483
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,542
Abbey: this work? Yeah,

484
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:32,998
Dan: I'm sorry. So they looked
at the portfolio, but they

485
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,048
didn't

486
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,462
Abbey: they looked at the
portfolio, but they didn't look

487
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:36,093
at the. bug. No.

488
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:39,018
Bekah: And I think, I think it
depends too, because I've

489
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:41,597
certainly been in interviews
where people have just mentioned

490
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:44,988
my blogs or have just mentioned
podcast episodes that I've been

491
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,948
on that they've listened to. And
so I think, you know, having a

492
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:52,373
balance or trying to do all of
those things. Can be really

493
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:54,157
important. And then I know we
had to write for flat iron

494
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,941
school

495
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:59,813
blog posts, and a lot of people
were not happy about having to

496
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:03,413
write those posts. And for some
people it's a, it's a very

497
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:04,942
different skill. It's like,
well, I'm learning this skill to

498
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:06,471
code.

499
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:10,163
And now you're asking me to do
this rather than thinking of it

500
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:12,562
as this is a tool for
networking, or this is to

501
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:14,961
demonstrate how you

502
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:17,610
can communicate something. Um,
so it can be overwhelming. And

503
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,258
an

504
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:23,647
additional skill that you feel
that you have to learn, but I

505
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,092
think just trying is worth it
because it does grow your

506
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,537
network

507
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,533
of people and the people that
you can talk to about these

508
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,528
things.

509
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:38,012
Abbey: Well, and to that point,
uh, I w I went to a middle in

510
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,712
high school that like, if I
didn't know how to write, like

511
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,105
that was a problem. So. I've
I've just been like, Hey, people

512
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,377
are

513
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:48,228
actually like interested in my
writing that I've always had to

514
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:50,807
do for every aspect of my life.
And I've never been complimented

515
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:55,012
on it before. Um, But the thing
that we're all ignoring is your

516
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,662
GitHub, because that can show
all of these things. And more

517
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:58,312
like if

518
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,623
you're reading, these are
descriptive and that's just you

519
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:03,262
describing exactly how this
technology works. That's totally

520
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:06,353
fine. If you've got a bunch of
projects in there that you

521
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,093
haven't blogged about. Like I
had an interviewer pull up my

522
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,833
GitHub

523
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:12,803
repos and have me walk him
through step-by-step over the

524
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:18,577
phone, a bunch of those stuff.
So like, Use the tools you're,

525
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,798
you're fancy you're on the
internet you're program or use

526
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:21,758
the tools that you have.

527
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:22,988
Dan: Yeah.

528
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,137
Bekah: your bootcamp talk about
writing, read MES.

529
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:29,512
Abbey: Yeah, we were, uh,
strongly encouraged. It wasn't

530
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,762
necessarily required, but like
we had to have a good get hub

531
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,932
profile that had, uh, the, the
headers were a thing by the time

532
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,563
I start. Yeah. Let's talk about
how, how spoiled I am. There's

533
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:44,083
always been Flexbox there's
always been. Um, so they're,

534
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,752
they're getting hub remains and
it was like, put like a picture

535
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,603
of you and like some description
of your stuff, bare minimum. And

536
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:52,032
then every single project it
would end and our teacher would

537
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,747
be like, so go make sure you
read me it's up to her to like

538
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:57,462
And he

539
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,343
really stressed a lot of things
like, um, make sure that anyone

540
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:04,452
going to your get hub can
immediately with like a minute.

541
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,928
Or a maximum of two clicks, get
into your app and play around

542
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:12,167
with it. If it's something
that's on your portfolio. And he

543
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:15,407
strongly suggested having like a
guest login for everything, and

544
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:18,557
you read me, filled out with
screenshots and walkthroughs so

545
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:21,048
that they didn't even have to go
to the live app and all that

546
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:25,817
stuff. His was, his whole career
was built around, like he does

547
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:29,563
Udemy. LinkedIn courses. And at
this point, people will call him

548
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,323
and ask him to do a job, having
just seen those courses and be

549
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,843
like, oh yeah. I mean, I know,
you know what you're talking

550
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:35,413
about. So.

551
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:36,838
Dan: Yeah, I think that's great
advice if you, I mean,

552
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,083
especially

553
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,363
if you have a project like that,
because lots of times you see.

554
00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:42,802
Projects and, you know, I
suppose this is more of in

555
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,392
tutorial and

556
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:49,313
then in, um, uh, maybe in a boot
camp, but you see somebody

557
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:50,632
learning and doing a project,
you know, an example project.

558
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,951
And

559
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:55,613
it's hard to tell sometimes if
it's just been cloned from the

560
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:58,042
example, or, you know, if
they've, if a person has just

561
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:03,337
been going through the steps and
pasting in, um, or if they. Done

562
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:06,157
a lot of the work, you know,
and, and the steps that you're

563
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:07,822
describing, I think go a long
way towards, um, solving that,

564
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:09,487
you

565
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,243
know, and actually displaying
like that you have done this

566
00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:12,998
work

567
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:14,978
and you do understand this
project and you do understand

568
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:18,548
like why it does what it does.
Um, et cetera. I like the idea

569
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:18,607
of.

570
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,698
Abbey: We keep talking about my
fancy blog, but let's be clear.

571
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,498
That's me being like, oh, I
built this thing here was my

572
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,298
first step

573
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:28,117
code block. Can't my second step
code block. Like it's. And then

574
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:30,877
I

575
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,978
was like, why are people
responding to this so much? And

576
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:35,498
then I see other blogs that are
just like code black code black

577
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:41,377
code block. And I'm like, oh, so
just say the steps you took and

578
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:44,617
people will believe you I'm like
your blog. This is the secret to

579
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:45,367
my success.

580
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:49,553
Bekah: Okay.

581
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:50,837
Dan: no, go ahead, Bekah.

582
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:52,807
Bekah: I was just going to say
one of the tips that I got when

583
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,501
I

584
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:59,333
was starting to apply for jobs
was to create, um, a short walk

585
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,657
through of each of your
projects. And actually somebody

586
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:03,981
had told me

587
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:07,432
if you're not very confident in
the code that you wrote

588
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:13,238
sometimes. Linking to the video
is better because you can talk

589
00:27:13,238 --> 00:27:16,178
about it. If you're confident in
how you talk about it. They're

590
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,022
probably not going to ask you
questions about what you did

591
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:19,866
with

592
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:23,738
their code, with your code. So I
don't know. I mean, it makes it

593
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:25,447
like a quick reference point.
You can talk through things, but

594
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,156
also

595
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,488
that might be another way to
communicate what you've been

596
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,117
working on.

597
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,958
Abbey: Uh, I'm going to go ahead
and credit my husband with, uh,

598
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:40,762
how good I am at describing my
projects to people. Not great.

599
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:45,173
Let's be clear. Uh, we had to do
presentations of all of our

600
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:48,022
projects for the bootcamp. And I
was the only one that got

601
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:51,532
prompted to like explain the
business case at night. Like

602
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,002
maybe talk slower.

603
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:53,607
Bekah: Right.

604
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:58,732
Abbey: So there were times where
he like watched the recording or

605
00:27:58,732 --> 00:27:59,857
something. Cause I'd be like, I
just like, what am I doing

606
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:00,982
wrong?

607
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:04,492
And he was like, so all these
people are spending five minutes

608
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:06,215
on one. That's like a fraction
of any of the features that

609
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,938
you've

610
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,348
built in here. And you're going
through everything, everything

611
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,758
in

612
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:14,028
the same amount of time, like
you need to actually explain how

613
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,998
difficult things are to like
figure out and like your process

614
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,497
and like aspects of the code
that you enjoyed writing or

615
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,937
didn't

616
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,052
enjoy writing or stuff like
that. And applying that to

617
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,166
interviews.

618
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:29,077
A whole nother step, because if
by the time I was in my final

619
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:31,657
interviews, like I had rehearsed
all of my answers so much, which

620
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:33,622
is another point, um, that I
wasn't like, I was like

621
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,587
exhausted

622
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:40,327
in my last interview and had all
the answers and it went fine

623
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:45,788
because I was just not panicked
and practiced all of this. And.

624
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:50,083
If you, Yeah. Explaining your
code to people, especially like

625
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,823
link, explain your code to your
dad. Like you don't have to use

626
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:55,643
all of the technical concepts,
but explain that you wrote, like

627
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:58,492
you had to sit there and write a
button that would listen for a

628
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:01,992
thing and then do this thing and
response. And once you can start

629
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,603
explaining it to lay medic, it's
a lot easier to then jump into

630
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:08,383
all of the heavy technical
concepts. When someone asks you

631
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:08,893
in an interview.

632
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,795
Dan: I love that. I, I, uh, I
was going to say, and this is

633
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:14,102
just

634
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:15,708
going to tie back. Great to, I
keep saying about how great it

635
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,313
is

636
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:19,667
to write, but somebody, I can't
remember if it was on our

637
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,021
podcast

638
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,747
or a different one, but it was
talking about, um, the writing,

639
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:25,472
a

640
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,927
blog post about that. Like, if
you wrote a blog, post

641
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,382
explaining

642
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:32,583
kind of the steps that you did
for a project, um, it helps you

643
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,923
be prepared for when somebody
asks you about it, you know, and

644
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,437
it's just like the, maybe even
just a script for your answer.

645
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:37,951
It

646
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:40,290
helps you talk about it more.
Um, Uh, I dunno, thoroughly and,

647
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,417
you

648
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,958
know, with more detail, um, and
probably also help you remember

649
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,368
if you have it, you know,
helping you remember the steps.

650
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,778
Cause if

651
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,508
I wrote something a year ago and
somebody asked me to talk about

652
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,577
it, I, if I hadn't done any
prep, I would be like, uh, I

653
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:55,646
don't

654
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,268
know. Well, let's go look at it
and see,

655
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,883
Abbey: let's be clear in
interviews. I've been like, uh,

656
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,727
that was four months ago. I
wrote a lot of code in between

657
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,512
now. And

658
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,942
then can you give me like a
little bit more specific on your

659
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:10,032
question, please come. What are
you, what answer are you looking

660
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,732
for For me? And I've got what
two blog posts talk now where

661
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,432
pretty

662
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:20,107
much my answer to everything is
practice. Practicing the thing,

663
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:25,147
practicing the thing without any
caveats, like you wrote a thing,

664
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,332
it doesn't have to be like, oh,
I didn't write the complete

665
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:27,517
thing

666
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:28,763
and I didn't write this and I
didn't write that. Like, you

667
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,008
can,

668
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,297
you can have that anxiety
yourself if you want, but

669
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,556
there's

670
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:33,802
no point in telling an
interviewer because he's the

671
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,047
only

672
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:38,377
person, like the only thing they
care about is you coming in to

673
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:40,508
the role and being able to do
that same thing.

674
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:42,252
Dan: For

675
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:44,678
Abbey: And like, at that level,
so.

676
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:48,437
Dan: I think that's great. I
get. For me personally having,

677
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:51,172
or even

678
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:53,092
just outlined having this sort
of thing down, um, helps me

679
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,011
because

680
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,563
I just go like galaxy brain
immediately, you know, and I get

681
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,752
caught up, you know, my brain is
like hopping all over the place

682
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:02,813
and if I'm just, and I'm sure
packets listeners have heard me

683
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:07,643
do this on the podcast, but, uh,
my, you know, not having

684
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:09,052
something to follow my brain
just goes all over the place and

685
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,461
with

686
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:15,498
code in, you know, it's. Uh,
there can be a logical way to

687
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,137
walk somebody through and there,
but if you just go follow every

688
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,657
import or something, and you're
like, well, this component, you

689
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:21,582
know, and then he gets
sidetracked and blah, blah,

690
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:22,507
blah,

691
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,827
blah, blah. I don't know. So
having it all written down and

692
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:26,958
practicing it, it's just such
great advice.

693
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:30,657
Abbey: Yeah, I uh, I talked
about being prompted to give the

694
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:34,587
business case and that's because
like very frequently, like on a

695
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:38,548
daily basis, I'll tell a story
with exactly zero context. I'm

696
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:42,448
just assume people are in my
brain and know what I'm talking

697
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,517
about to the point that like our
friends will just stare at me

698
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:46,586
the

699
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:51,637
one that. You know, married to
someone like me and be like, and

700
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,767
Matt will be like, so here's
what she's trying to say. Here's

701
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:55,897
where

702
00:31:55,897 --> 00:32:00,178
she got the idea from here's
what's happening. And I learned

703
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:04,607
from interviewers mid interview,
rant, rant, rant, rant, rant,

704
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:08,002
rant, rant, rant, rant, rant,
rant, rant, rant, about code. So

705
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,627
to summarize my top three things
that I would use in the answer

706
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:13,252
to

707
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:17,303
this question, this point, this
point, and this point, and the

708
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:21,022
level of understanding and
interviewers faces went up

709
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,373
exponentially.

710
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:23,488
Dan: Yeah.

711
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:28,432
Abbey: And there are times where
very kind interviews. Prompt me

712
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,322
to be like, and could you, could
you summarize that answer

713
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:32,152
quickly

714
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,952
for me? And then like, I could
do it totally fine, but like, if

715
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,751
in

716
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,272
the, with the anxiety and like
being asked the question and

717
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:42,143
wanting to tell everyone about
code, I would just rant for like

718
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,283
three minutes and they'd be
like, well clear, clearly she

719
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,423
knows

720
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:45,788
what she's talking about. I'm
not sure if this was related to

721
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,153
my

722
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:51,345
actual question, but here we
are. So. You can do it. It's

723
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:55,537
really

724
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,538
apparently my point to everyone
getting a job.

725
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,202
Bekah: I'd do the same thing.
And I think for me, it's such a

726
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:05,803
challenge when I have been going
off for a while and I don't

727
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:08,863
realize that I am. And then I
see, like I noticed their face

728
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:14,542
and I'm like, oh, I need to
figure out. To bring this back

729
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:16,448
or, and, but then it also makes
me more nervous because I see

730
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,323
the

731
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:21,353
look on their face and it just
like has upped the pressure to

732
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,613
come back and like be better.
And I just was for the last

733
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:25,873
three

734
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,673
minutes, it's it's a whole
process.

735
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,948
Abbey: It really is. It's all
practice. Uh, I was in an

736
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,603
interview process. It was a fee.
It was the one the cycle before

737
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:36,258
I

738
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:38,447
got my job and I made it to the
final interview for two

739
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,636
mid-level

740
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:43,497
roles. Impressive. Uh, I like
the second one. The first one

741
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:46,357
had no

742
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:51,637
intention of hiring me at any
point. Uh, the second one, uh,

743
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:55,117
the hiring manager offered to be
my reference and I made them

744
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,807
think about it for an extra
week. And accomplishment. It's

745
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,497
not the

746
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:01,377
job that I wanted, but it's an
accomplishment. And there was a

747
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,102
point where I was in, oh my God.
That was the one where I was in

748
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:04,827
a

749
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:07,978
three hours straight of people
asking me questions. And there

750
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:08,847
was one point where they were
like, here, you could have a

751
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,716
five

752
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:17,818
minute break to get some water.
And, um, they, they were trying

753
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:20,518
to see if I was the type of
person that would go to a star

754
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,248
wars movie in the middle of the
day with them. That's the

755
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:27,097
question they should have asked.
They asked me. What are your

756
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:32,438
hobbies? And, uh, I saw their
eyes glaze over as I was

757
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,847
answering this question because
it was like, you can't, you

758
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:35,256
can't

759
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:38,257
ask me that question. Like, let
me just keep going on for like

760
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:40,147
literally hours. Like I could
do, if you get me started on

761
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,006
one,

762
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,538
like that's just at the end. I
was like, Yeah. And fantasy. And

763
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:48,688
they're like, oh my God. Oh my
God. I was like, Okay. ask

764
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:51,838
better

765
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:52,347
questions.

766
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:56,612
Bekah: How many interviews did
you go through?

767
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:05,713
Abbey: Um, I think I got up to
like 160 something applications.

768
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:08,833
Um, I think that was the final
number. I can look it up at some

769
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:13,722
point, but, um, I went through
like getting to the final

770
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:19,123
interview, probably five or six.
Um, there was one in the very

771
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:23,003
beginning where. I was
interviewing for a dev ops role

772
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:26,632
because I had applied to the
company and they saw my resume,

773
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:31,012
uh, like a month later and were
like, oh, well, she could do a

774
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,112
dev ops role, which like,
honestly, that's what I was

775
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:36,293
expecting to go into, uh, with
my background. Cause eight and a

776
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:37,343
half years of customer service,
I was like, I can break it into

777
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,393
the

778
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:40,612
Texas tech industry and then
eventually get into a developer

779
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:44,543
role. And the longer I was not
doing customer service, the more

780
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:48,652
I was like, I never want to do
it again. And, uh, In that

781
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:50,722
interview. My very first
technical interview, the hiring

782
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:53,123
manager looked at me and was
like, yeah, I can't, I can't in

783
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,432
good conscience, like recommend
you for this role. Like,

784
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:57,802
obviously I would hire you for
this role, but like, you need to

785
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,652
hold out for a developer role
and then like, promise me that

786
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:03,143
something would appear. And I
just never did. And I was like,

787
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:06,132
well, that's unfortunate, but
yeah. There were other dev ops

788
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:09,132
roles where like, uh, one of my
friends, I pass the lead on to

789
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,692
him and he's, he's in it now.
Cause I was like, look like,

790
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:12,252
this

791
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,012
is a great role. You're not
wrong. And like looking at my

792
00:36:15,012 --> 00:36:16,287
resume and being like, I would
be a great fit, but I honestly,

793
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:17,562
like

794
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:19,992
I would just be looking for the
next fill, like the first

795
00:36:19,992 --> 00:36:23,112
developer role I could find. And
he was like, yeah. It's like, he

796
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:27,853
was like, I'll pass your resume
on. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Um, as

797
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,553
far as like not final
interviews, I probably did a

798
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:33,253
handful more. So

799
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,827
let's say. Like 10 to 15 total
interview processes from like

800
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:40,401
160

801
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:41,483
plus applications.

802
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:45,293
Bekah: And how many months was
that?

803
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:50,132
Abbey: Um, I started applying
seriously and November. I didn't

804
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:52,247
get any bites until January. Um,
and I graduated from the

805
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:54,362
bootcamp

806
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:55,742
in January at the very
beginning.

807
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:58,503
Bekah: Okay. And this is like in
the middle of COVID. So there

808
00:36:58,503 --> 00:37:00,003
was

809
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,342
hiring freezes everywhere.

810
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:09,898
Abbey: Exploded in like, uh,
January 20, 21, especially like

811
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:14,217
tech. It was nuts because I had
been looking since August,

812
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:16,978
September, and then all of a
sudden it was like daily, like

813
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,737
five coming out for junior
level. So,

814
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:21,148
Dan: Yeah.

815
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:22,018
Abbey: Yeah.

816
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:24,582
Dan: Yeah. I was, I had seen
that before, too. And was

817
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:26,846
interesting

818
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,682
to see because you know, part of
it is. New budgets, you know,

819
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,517
and

820
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,002
stuff. And then I think
companies finally figured out

821
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,486
like the,

822
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,152
the, um, that they are okay with
the remote stuff, you know,

823
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,817
which

824
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:37,177
has been

825
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:41,963
Abbey: well, Q1, Q too. Like you
could talk to recruiters. I was

826
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,932
in the recruiting industry,
right. It'd be like everybody.

827
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:46,123
We're going to be Okay. We're
going to make it through, like,

828
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:49,512
it's gonna, let's just rally
together. And I don't know, do

829
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,347
something with our new free
time. Honestly, I had eight

830
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:53,182
hours to

831
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:56,137
study programming in like April
20, 20. I'd answer like two

832
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:59,092
calls

833
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:04,583
a day. And, uh, by like Q4, uh,
you could see people were like

834
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,652
relaxing a bit. And like
recruiters were like, oh, I

835
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,112
actually have things to do.
Cause again, like if you want to

836
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:11,302
connect with recruiters, connect
with me on LinkedIn because

837
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:11,708
Bekah: Hm.

838
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,842
Abbey: hundreds, hundreds of
recruiters in my network. So.

839
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,722
Bekah: Were you able to take
some of the stuff you learned

840
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:18,801
from

841
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:21,413
recruiting and apply it to your
job search?

842
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,783
Abbey: definitely. Um, uh, so
my, one of the main aspects of

843
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:27,498
my job

844
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:29,178
was breaking down, uh, job
descriptions and writing them

845
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:30,858
and

846
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:31,668
so that we could post them on
the internet and the right

847
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:32,478
people

848
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:36,887
would apply. So from that, I not
only could pull out and again, I

849
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:39,288
was in engineering. So like
there was some, there were some

850
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:43,157
differences, uh, in engineering,
if you job hop from after, like

851
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:46,277
one year, people are like, is
something wrong with you? If in

852
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:52,483
Texas, A given. And I was like,
oh, hello. the other part, the

853
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:55,893
other one that was, I was also
in frequent calls with hiring

854
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,742
managers, retooling the job
description that they had given

855
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,813
us because they weren't seeing
the right candidate. So I knew

856
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:03,257
how incredibly frequent it is
for the job description, not to

857
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,701
match

858
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:07,247
what the hiring manager is
looking for. So that made it

859
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,792
very

860
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,293
easy for me to take the advice
of someone saying, well, if you

861
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:11,793
see

862
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:15,807
one book. Go for it. Cause like
the hiring managers don't know

863
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:20,257
what they want. My current job
description was. Three years

864
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:27,128
experience CS degree, master's
preferred, uh, the recruiter

865
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,697
that, uh, I worked with heavily
implied that I would never get

866
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:33,367
the job. And then did the same
thing to my friend who was in my

867
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,542
bootcamp, who has also gotten
the job. So like, it's a whole

868
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,717
thing.

869
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:41,858
But, um, the other thing was,
uh, I was trying to do the math

870
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:47,617
earlier. Let's say on average, I
over, I was involved in 12

871
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:52,807
interviews a week, right? And I
was in that for five years. So

872
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,457
like, there was, there were
times in my own interview

873
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,107
process where

874
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:59,197
I'd be like, I'm not getting
this job just from like the way

875
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,492
feeling out the way that a
hiring manager responds, because

876
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:03,486
th the

877
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,978
one where they waited a week to
tell me that they'd be my

878
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:08,588
reference. Like, I was like, I'm
not, I really wanted this. And I

879
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:09,848
know I didn't get it at this
point. And everyone was like,

880
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,108
no,

881
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,108
you've got to wait. And I was
like, Hmm, I would have heard on

882
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:20,963
Friday. Uh, but beyond that, You
hear feedback from the

883
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:24,293
candidates? Cause I was supposed
to be every single time a

884
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:25,612
candidate went through an
interview. I was supposed to get

885
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:27,862
on the phone with them and at
least hear them out about how it

886
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:30,232
went. And you hear about like
the questions that they got

887
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:32,602
asked and

888
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,717
like, if we sent three
candidates through a process,

889
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:36,741
then I would

890
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:39,239
know. What they had the, like
the person that got it had

891
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,736
versus the

892
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:44,677
two that we sent in previously
and stuff like that. And there

893
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:47,378
are some things that I highly
recommend that are very

894
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,978
controversial, not because I
think that the U S hiring

895
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:52,718
process, the way it is, is
great, or like, has any

896
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:54,458
standards

897
00:40:54,458 --> 00:41:00,188
whatsoever, but. can use a thank
you note to push for feedback.

898
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:03,878
Like even if you're not getting
the job, you are more likely to

899
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,268
hear why you didn't get the job.
If you're emailing someone like

900
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,428
politely and asking questions
and like a thank you note as

901
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,588
just a

902
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:16,282
wrapper for that, you can be
like, Hey recruiter. Here. Can

903
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,722
you pass this? Thank you. Note
on for me also, can you answer

904
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,162
these

905
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:22,612
questions for me? And then like,
I would get, um, my current role

906
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:25,072
with my first interviewer
responded back with like, oh,

907
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:26,137
thank you for sending this.
Like, it was so lovely to speak

908
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:27,171
to you

909
00:41:27,172 --> 00:41:29,963
too. I'm I'm that was like, that
gives you a little confidence as

910
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:34,103
you go into the next interview
and stuff like that. So, uh, the

911
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,083
other, what was the other point
that I had? Oh, I would do

912
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,003
hiring

913
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:38,512
and firing.

914
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:39,572
Bekah: Yeah.

915
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,787
Abbey: So I, I would get to
like, get the feedback as to why

916
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,457
they

917
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:48,307
wanted to go with the candidate.
I would do, uh, negotiations on

918
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:52,148
behalf of the candidate. Like I
would call it laminate and, um,

919
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,387
say it's Joe Schmoe, mechanical
engineer. And he's been doing

920
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,367
mechanical engineering for 30
years and he's been doing

921
00:41:57,367 --> 00:42:00,367
contract work for 20 years. And
he was like, no, where are those

922
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:04,057
places? Uh, the commute I would
have to do plus this, this, this

923
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:08,628
and this, I need $3 more. Yeah.
Um, like once you get really

924
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:12,617
comfortable with that kind of
negotiation and everything on

925
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,748
behalf of someone else, it's
slightly easier to apply to

926
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:17,057
yourself. I still feel like I
lowballed myself in a couple of

927
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:18,602
interview processes, but that
was also me being very desperate

928
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,147
for

929
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:23,225
my first job in tech. Uh, and
me. But like, even then I was

930
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:26,302
doing

931
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:28,072
it based on like market
research. Like you go to indeed

932
00:42:28,072 --> 00:42:29,842
you do plug

933
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,072
in the job title, you plug in
your location, and that gives

934
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:32,302
you

935
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:35,782
the average hourly rate or
average salary for any job. Uh,

936
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,618
it's on the indeed salary tool
or whatever. And that's how we

937
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,443
did

938
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,952
estimating for the rates that we
were putting out on our job

939
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:47,663
descriptions for. Anytime that
the client didn't set the rates.

940
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:52,402
So like I knew how to find that
kind of information to make

941
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:56,842
myself a competitive candidate
by low-balling myself, or just

942
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:58,732
saying that, no, I'm not going
to accept anything below this.

943
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:00,622
And,

944
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:02,332
uh, that ended up being my first
job doubled my salary after

945
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,951
seven

946
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:04,733
months of unemployment.

947
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:05,708
Bekah: Nice.

948
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:09,713
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. I'm
sure that sounds like a nice, a

949
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,052
bunch of information to have in
your back pocket when you're

950
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:13,532
going through this process. Um,

951
00:43:13,538 --> 00:43:16,748
Abbey: yeah. And like just a lot
of stuff where like demystifies

952
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,908
the whole hiring process,
because they're all, I mean, I

953
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,708
had a

954
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,527
psych professor who would rant
about this frequently. Like

955
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:27,128
they're not trained. Like when I
had to hire people for internal

956
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,448
roles, they were just like, here
I are interviewing, hire

957
00:43:28,448 --> 00:43:29,768
someone.

958
00:43:30,188 --> 00:43:32,918
They weren't like ask them these
questions or here's what we're

959
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:35,557
looking for. And my role was a
little bit difficult because

960
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:37,649
like, we couldn't even do KPIs,
which are like, uh, Setting

961
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,741
goals

962
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:41,992
for people to meet so that you
know, that they're performing

963
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:43,672
well in their role, because it
would be like, well, a lot of

964
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:48,538
this is dependent on what comes
in. So. I just asked the same

965
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,458
questions and we hired a couple
people and I failed miserably

966
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,378
two

967
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:57,807
out of three times. Like, and if
I, someone with experience in a

968
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,502
lot of interview processes,
can't look at another human and

969
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:01,197
be

970
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:03,978
like, Yeah. you're definitely
going to write it. In a timely

971
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,823
manner, like how is someone else
going to do that? So a lot of

972
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,668
it,

973
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,602
it turned it into me knowing
that like a human is sitting on

974
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:11,447
the

975
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:15,438
other side of this call or
whatever. Uh, and I'm convincing

976
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:20,657
that human, but I will do
whatever they want me to do for

977
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:27,563
money. Hopefully I'll leave. And
development related, but like

978
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:28,313
that's a

979
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:29,438
Dan: set of skills.

980
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:33,563
Abbey: exactly like that's a,
that's a totally different

981
00:44:33,563 --> 00:44:37,273
approach than, and who's like,
obviously this hiring manager

982
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:38,787
knows everything there is to
know about developing and I'm

983
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:40,301
this

984
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,032
beginner developer trying to
convince them that I will also

985
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:45,492
know everything about developing
and that's not at all what you

986
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:47,832
have to do. If, if I haven't
very fully explained by process,

987
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:50,172
which

988
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:54,202
was one bullet point I apply. I
don't know. I tell him, I study,

989
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:57,862
I rant a lot. Sometimes I
summarize the rent. Like the

990
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,317
most, the most positive feedback
I got was, wow. You're just,

991
00:44:59,317 --> 00:45:00,772
your

992
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:02,452
enthusiasm is really there. Like
you've got a passion for

993
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,131
learning

994
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,202
and that's what a lot of people
want to see in these developer

995
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:08,107
roles. And I was just, I was
just like, I like coat. Here's a

996
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:10,012
Sheba

997
00:45:10,012 --> 00:45:10,342
counter.

998
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,623
Bekah: I really liked that last
thing that you were talking

999
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,347
about, about showing the
enthusiasm, because I was

1000
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,071
talking

1001
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,902
about this with a couple of
different people recently in

1002
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:21,732
how.

1003
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,762
When you're interviewing for a
position, how your personality

1004
00:45:25,762 --> 00:45:28,132
comes across, whether or not
that affects, you know,

1005
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:30,502
decisions and

1006
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:35,422
whether or not people with
stronger personalities kind of,

1007
00:45:35,452 --> 00:45:40,762
um, get taken out of the
interview process just because

1008
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:45,112
there are, um, I don't know that
people just think of them in a

1009
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:47,333
certain way. Like, well, if
they're responding in this way

1010
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,043
or, wow, that was really
intense, you know, maybe this is

1011
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:50,753
not the

1012
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:54,083
person that we want to be
working with when, um, you know,

1013
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,623
realistically you don't get a
full picture of personality in

1014
00:45:57,623 --> 00:46:00,982
the interview process, but do
you think that that can be an

1015
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:04,341
issue

1016
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,612
when you're interviewing, like
how you present your personnel?

1017
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:11,978
Abbey: So this, this goes back
to my point that they're bias

1018
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,338
written humans. Like you have to
find the human on the other side

1019
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:19,927
of the table, but like you can,
you can jive with, because there

1020
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:25,177
were plenty of, there was I'm
going to remove all identifiable

1021
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:28,418
aspects of this story, but I
know someone that recently got a

1022
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,998
job

1023
00:46:31,568 --> 00:46:35,228
with the company that they got a
job for, because. And I quote,

1024
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:36,997
well, we've hired developers
with strong accents before, and

1025
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:38,676
it's

1026
00:46:38,677 --> 00:46:42,728
worked out totally fine. And
genuinely, he's one of the

1027
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:46,447
smartest developers I know, and
wasn't getting a job longer than

1028
00:46:46,447 --> 00:46:50,168
the rest of us because he had a
very thick accent. And that is a

1029
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:53,527
bias that a lot of interviewers
have. And I've heard it from,

1030
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:55,087
I've heard a different version,
which is like, this is

1031
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:56,526
offensive.

1032
00:46:56,527 --> 00:47:01,913
I apologize. But like, That
hiring manager was Asian. He's

1033
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:04,733
only going to hire Asian
candidates. That's why I didn't

1034
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:10,342
get the job. And like, I can't
speak to the reality of whatever

1035
00:47:10,342 --> 00:47:14,737
that is in that industry or
whatever, but yeah. There every

1036
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:16,807
human that you get on the other
side of the table with is going

1037
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:21,097
to have some sort of bias. And
like, like, I hate to phrase it

1038
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:25,717
this way, but like your goal is
to be as vanilla and inoffensive

1039
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,148
as possible. So definitely don't
go in and like curse out your

1040
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:28,538
interviewers.

1041
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:33,233
Bekah: But you want to be like
vanilla with a little sprinkles,

1042
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,648
right. So they can remember you.
So like how, how much is too

1043
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:38,063
much

1044
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:38,753
sprinkles?

1045
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,177
Abbey: I don't know, cause I
would take notes and then write

1046
00:47:40,177 --> 00:47:41,362
a

1047
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:44,092
thank you note with interesting
details from our interview in it

1048
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:46,027
and send that to the
interviewer. So I asked every

1049
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,511
interviewer, uh,

1050
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,902
how did you get your first tech
role and got some really fun

1051
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,813
answers and would work that into
my thank you note. So like you

1052
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:58,012
want it's you want to be able to
show that you are someone who

1053
00:47:58,012 --> 00:48:00,623
could come into a corporate
environment or whatever it is

1054
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:02,198
like the standards and tech
interviews are so much lower

1055
00:48:02,198 --> 00:48:03,773
than

1056
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:05,763
they were in injury engineering.
I had interviews show up,

1057
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:07,753
showing

1058
00:48:07,753 --> 00:48:09,943
up in like a baseball hat and a
t-shirt and I was like, what is

1059
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:14,532
happening? So like present
yourself. Well, like get up, get

1060
00:48:14,532 --> 00:48:17,532
an interview outfit. It doesn't
have to be a full blown suit. I

1061
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:20,802
don't think. And for tech
interviews, but like, you know,

1062
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:25,512
present yourself as you want to
be presented. It's like, bring

1063
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:29,873
your best self, uh, Again, curse
out your interviewers. Like I

1064
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:35,032
say, this it's happened and, uh,
answered the questions to the

1065
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:38,302
best of your ability and really
show that like you're dedicated

1066
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:41,003
and passionate about doing the
thing that you're trying to do.

1067
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:45,293
Uh, like if you're trying to
learn something new, so that

1068
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:47,033
you'll be better at ramping up
or anything like that, like,

1069
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:48,773
those

1070
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,172
are the things that you want to
talk about. And then you want to

1071
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:55,103
answer every question, like as
positively as possible. And then

1072
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:56,850
if you're not. You're going to
have to elaborate a little bit

1073
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,597
on

1074
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:01,927
what you mean by strong
personality, because like I only

1075
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:03,998
think about engineers yelling at
each other,

1076
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:07,793
Bekah: I don't even think, you
know, there, there are people

1077
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,438
that come into a room. Right.
And they kind of just, they,

1078
00:49:09,438 --> 00:49:11,083
they

1079
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:17,063
automatically take over the room
or I'm trying to think of an

1080
00:49:17,063 --> 00:49:18,983
example with out, like

1081
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:19,717
Abbey: like giving

1082
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:24,052
Bekah: using a name of a person.
Um, but, but something, somebody

1083
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:27,952
that comes in and they're ready
to talk and they're there. Um,

1084
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:31,152
Abbey: Little T

1085
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:32,092
Bekah: really hard.

1086
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:33,672
Abbey: like you Keep going You
keep going too fast and you

1087
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:34,692
like,

1088
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:36,523
talk over people and it's a lot
of.

1089
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:39,257
Bekah: yeah. Or I don't know,
Dan, come on. Help me out. I

1090
00:49:39,257 --> 00:49:41,446
know

1091
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:41,628
that

1092
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:43,192
Dan: um, I'm wondering, I I'm
actually not sure what, which

1093
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:44,542
way

1094
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,773
you're going here, but like, are
you, are you saying, are you

1095
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:47,003
like

1096
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:49,472
worried that, uh, strong
personalities and negative.

1097
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,002
Bekah: oh, for sure. Right?
Like, oh, I'm not sure I can

1098
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:54,637
work with

1099
00:49:54,637 --> 00:49:57,818
this person because they've got,
they're really

1100
00:49:57,983 --> 00:49:59,723
Dan: mean, my advice for this is
it's hard. It's, it's hard for

1101
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:01,463
me

1102
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:04,148
to nail this down because I
think that, um, where you are in

1103
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,833
your

1104
00:50:06,952 --> 00:50:11,682
sort of journey and also like,
depending on, you know, your,

1105
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:12,932
your specific like privileges
and stuff, like, like we were

1106
00:50:12,932 --> 00:50:14,182
talking

1107
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:16,282
about before, where like where
you are in life and what's going

1108
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,262
on, um,

1109
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:18,337
Abbey: lot of the things that I
ended up talking about were

1110
00:50:18,337 --> 00:50:19,372
like,

1111
00:50:19,373 --> 00:50:21,862
uh, getting back into the
workforce after being a

1112
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:22,583
stay-at-home parent,

1113
00:50:23,282 --> 00:50:27,643
Dan: right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
So, but my, my point is, um, my

1114
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:29,383
advice is usually to present
yourself how you are, um,

1115
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:31,123
because

1116
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:35,233
if, if they're not going to like
you like that, um, they're not

1117
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:41,112
going to have a good time. Like
if you, if you, um, sort of act

1118
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:43,330
like a different person and they
hire you and then. Like you

1119
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,517
can't

1120
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:49,898
just act like that forever. Um,
that's not to say that. That's

1121
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:50,797
not to say that like,

1122
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:51,702
Bekah: a notch

1123
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:56,047
Dan: Well, well, sure. I mean,
yes. I mean maybe I guess, I

1124
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:58,387
mean, and this is where my point
is like as a junior developer,

1125
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,727
it

1126
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:02,722
might be more important to get
the first job regardless of it.

1127
00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:04,716
I

1128
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:07,418
like, and this is where I get
wishy-washy my on advice. You

1129
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:11,527
know what I mean? Because that
first job interview is not

1130
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:14,438
interview. I'm sorry, but the
first job, like the first actual

1131
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:18,788
job is like such a big step and,
and your second job, like the

1132
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:21,637
interview process. He's probably
still going to do interviews and

1133
00:51:21,637 --> 00:51:24,847
all of that stuff, but I like
coming from a place of

1134
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:26,992
experiences is, uh, I imagine
the experience is much

1135
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:29,137
different.

1136
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:33,547
Right. Um, but like me
personally, and also I'm just, I

1137
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:36,878
I've been a developer for a long
time. Uh, you know, so I don't,

1138
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,327
I'm not really worried. I'm
also, you know, in a spot where

1139
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:43,477
I am

1140
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:46,327
not desperate for a job or I'm
not, you know, I don't need one.

1141
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:48,037
My, if I lost my job or, you
know, whatever, for every, all

1142
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:49,747
of

1143
00:51:49,748 --> 00:51:51,488
my paying work went away, um, my
wife also works, you know? And

1144
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,228
so

1145
00:51:53,228 --> 00:51:55,628
it's so like, I'm like in the
spot of privilege where I don't

1146
00:51:55,628 --> 00:52:00,168
have to, um, I dunno, but like,
we're, we're, I don't like,

1147
00:52:00,168 --> 00:52:01,442
there's some things that I know
specifically that I don't have

1148
00:52:01,442 --> 00:52:02,716
to

1149
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:07,878
worry about, but I, if I'm
meeting somebody or doing an

1150
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:12,318
interview, stuff like that, I'm
probably not going to, uh, maybe

1151
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:14,088
I'll, uh, you know, like dull
some edges a little bit, but,

1152
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:15,858
um,

1153
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:18,557
I'm just going to try to be
myself because that's who I am.

1154
00:52:18,588 --> 00:52:21,077
Right. And like, I I've, I'm
starting a relationship with

1155
00:52:21,077 --> 00:52:23,717
somebody. I don't like, I'm not
gonna, I don't know, fake it,

1156
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:24,347
but.

1157
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:27,672
Abbey: your point, your point.
And, uh, and first I'm going to

1158
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:30,583
phrase it a little bit, a little
bit differently. Uh, so it's

1159
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,742
like, it's like meeting your
partner's parents for the first

1160
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:34,062
time. Like you want to be on
your best behavior. You want to

1161
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,382
look

1162
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:37,753
nice. You don't want to be too
drastically away from your

1163
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:40,632
regular personality, but you
still want to be like, you know,

1164
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,652
a little more palatable than you
would be like with your friends

1165
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:49,362
out in the backyard or something
like that. And then not every

1166
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:54,128
interviewer has to, like you
like. There is someone out there

1167
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:56,887
that will be like, Yeah. I can
find a spot for you on my team.

1168
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:59,918
And your chances of, if you have
a strong personality and you're

1169
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:01,688
finding that your interviewing
is not going especially well

1170
00:53:01,688 --> 00:53:03,458
because

1171
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,902
of your strong personality, then
it's time to start networking

1172
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:08,346
and

1173
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:11,617
find someone that you can get
like a rapport with and

1174
00:53:11,617 --> 00:53:14,827
understands that you're not like
a hundred percent, this person

1175
00:53:14,827 --> 00:53:16,462
that you are when you're nervous
and your interview. And then

1176
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:18,097
they

1177
00:53:18,097 --> 00:53:19,582
can start taking you through an
interview process because like

1178
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:21,067
we

1179
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:23,318
see time and time again, through
networking through Twitter,

1180
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:24,818
through whatever. Like if
someone likes you and they find

1181
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,318
an

1182
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,768
opening and they have enough say
in the interview process, so

1183
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:32,047
you're going to get much further
than you would have if you're

1184
00:53:32,047 --> 00:53:34,478
just coming in and no one's
watching for you and you have

1185
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,967
this mysterious, strong
personality that you wouldn't

1186
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,228
want to show to your partner's
parents.

1187
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:40,478
Dan: Yeah. And you mentioned
something in there about, um,

1188
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:42,038
uh,

1189
00:53:42,038 --> 00:53:44,768
you know, being anxious, uh,
during an interview and that

1190
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,347
affecting your personality and,
and that's sort of something

1191
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:50,752
different, right? Like, uh, If
you have an I do, if you

1192
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:54,157
struggle

1193
00:53:54,157 --> 00:53:58,177
with like anxiety and, um, the
especially anxiety around

1194
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:00,998
performance and stuff like that,
then that's something that's a

1195
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:03,277
little different than like your
true personality, right? That's

1196
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:07,927
like, that's like your anxiety
or other issues affecting. The

1197
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:09,637
actual, like the actual
presentation of your, to

1198
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:12,907
yourself. Right. Um, and getting
away and getting in the way of

1199
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:16,478
that even. Um, so if you have a
habit of when you're anxious

1200
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,768
over-talking, or, or, or doing
things like that, um, that is

1201
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:22,537
something to just, I would say
to practice on, you know, um,

1202
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:24,306
and do

1203
00:54:24,518 --> 00:54:27,668
like Abby was saying, uh, lots
of practice, I think helps and

1204
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:32,467
probably there's other things to
help too. I, you know, um, and

1205
00:54:32,887 --> 00:54:35,498
Abbey: My interviews would have
gotten so much worse if I had to

1206
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:39,427
drive to the place at a certain
time. Oh my God. Like all of my

1207
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:41,032
interviews are on zoom. And at
first I was like, this sucks.

1208
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:42,637
And

1209
00:54:42,637 --> 00:54:44,168
then I was like, wait, this is
amazing.

1210
00:54:44,228 --> 00:54:47,617
Dan: Yeah, no, I, and I love
that. I was thinking about this

1211
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,858
the other day with coming out of
the pandemic. Um, there are

1212
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:56,992
actually things about zoom that.
Like, and prefer, um, with

1213
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,222
regards to anxiety and
performance issues and stuff

1214
00:54:58,222 --> 00:54:59,452
like

1215
00:54:59,452 --> 00:55:02,032
that. I don't have to, when I'm
on zoom, I don't have to worry

1216
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,463
about what I'm doing with my
hands or my feet or my body

1217
00:55:04,523 --> 00:55:09,563
really, you know? Um, and. Let's
actually think about this with

1218
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:12,682
masks and now like our daycare,
you don't have to wear masks

1219
00:55:12,682 --> 00:55:15,652
anymore if you were vaccinated.
And, uh, I was walking around.

1220
00:55:15,652 --> 00:55:17,393
I'm like, what, what do I do
with my face?

1221
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:17,902
Bekah: Okay.

1222
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:24,652
Dan: You know? But like all that
is to say, like the, um, it's

1223
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:26,497
just my, you know, I, I said be
your true self, um, before, and

1224
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:28,342
I

1225
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:32,197
was specifically. Not that
doesn't mean, you know, like

1226
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:34,822
there aren't, if your true self
is like, you lose control of

1227
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:37,387
some

1228
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:39,668
things because of anxiety and
thinking like that's something,

1229
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:41,918
you know, that is definitely can
be worked on and you can

1230
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:44,168
practice

1231
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:47,407
it and probably get better. Um,
have an easier time. Um,

1232
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,438
Abbey: And I want to be clear. I
was a puddle of sweat after

1233
00:55:50,438 --> 00:55:53,180
pretty much all of my
interviews. yeah. Uh, like I.

1234
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,922
Recently,

1235
00:55:55,922 --> 00:56:00,782
remember the desperation, the
anxiety, the everything being

1236
00:56:00,782 --> 00:56:03,902
like my one chance. And I'm
ruining it again in February. It

1237
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:09,063
was a really dark time for me.
And, uh, like there were, there

1238
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:10,932
were things where like my
husband would have to. Could you

1239
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,801
be good

1240
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:17,362
at algorithms? Could you just
study the algorithms alone?

1241
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:17,568
Bekah: Okay.

1242
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:19,747
Abbey: There's so anxiety
written at this point and he was

1243
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:20,752
like,

1244
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,928
could they be less anxiety
ridden if you practice them? And

1245
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:25,103
then I

1246
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:28,012
was doing 30 days of algorithms
on Twitter and like, people were

1247
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:30,202
interacting with that. And you
know, you see things all the

1248
00:56:30,202 --> 00:56:32,392
time

1249
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:36,503
that are people like, oh, you're
still looking for a job. So like

1250
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:38,572
the building in public is also
the practicing.

1251
00:56:40,237 --> 00:56:43,867
Dan: I would also say that. I
think it's fair, to be honest

1252
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,027
with your person you're
interfering with, if, you know,

1253
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:49,297
especially if you have, um, Well
really about anything, but, you

1254
00:56:49,297 --> 00:56:52,748
know, if you're like, I'm very
nervous and because of this

1255
00:56:52,748 --> 00:56:56,288
interview and I very much want
this job. Um, so I apologize

1256
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,458
because sometimes I talk too
fast when I'm nervous or

1257
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:58,628
something

1258
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:02,137
like that. Um, I think that
would go a long way to, um, to,

1259
00:57:02,248 --> 00:57:04,158
Abbey: Yeah. I've been like, can
you give me a second to

1260
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:06,068
formulate

1261
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:08,513
my answers so that it's slightly
less panicky and Franti. And

1262
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:10,958
they

1263
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,573
were like, oh Yeah. please.
Like, and, uh, when I was honest

1264
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,188
about

1265
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,407
like, Oh, I like, I can't take
this role cause I'll just be

1266
00:57:17,407 --> 00:57:20,047
wanting to move on immediately.
Thank you for your honesty. I

1267
00:57:20,047 --> 00:57:23,257
really appreciate that. Let me
see if I have anyone that has a

1268
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,517
developer role for you like
that. That's the kind of

1269
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:25,777
feedback you

1270
00:57:25,777 --> 00:57:27,772
get from being honest and open
about all this kind of stuff.

1271
00:57:27,772 --> 00:57:29,767
And

1272
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:31,537
if you do that and I'm proven
wrong, please give me their

1273
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:33,306
names

1274
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:35,068
so I can yell at them
personally. Like

1275
00:57:37,322 --> 00:57:37,413
Bekah: Okay.

1276
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:41,967
Abbey: you can find a, my handle
is sorry. Go ahead.

1277
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:44,378
Bekah: as you say, it's been
great to have you here. You

1278
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:46,882
talked about so many great
things and there are so many

1279
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:49,087
great tips

1280
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:52,898
here. It's like trying to
highlight as we went along. All

1281
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:56,677
of the things that I could say
were great about this episode,

1282
00:57:56,677 --> 00:57:58,267
but there, then I just quit.
Cause like there were too many

1283
00:57:58,267 --> 00:57:59,857
of

1284
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:02,617
them. So thank you so much for
being here. It's been great

1285
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:03,538
hearing you talk through this.

1286
00:58:04,518 --> 00:58:05,778
Abbey: Of course, I'm like the
one thing that I really wanted

1287
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,038
to

1288
00:58:07,038 --> 00:58:09,827
highlight is I got into this
because I was good at making

1289
00:58:09,827 --> 00:58:14,027
things pretty. Like if you are
the person that's like, I don't

1290
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:16,624
know, like if I'm cut out for
this. or whatever, See, just

1291
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:19,221
try,

1292
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:22,717
like, uh, I did not expect to
have a popular blog or be a

1293
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:26,152
great

1294
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:29,722
full-stack, uh, person, but
that's how it happened. And it's

1295
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:32,092
just because I was like, well, I
know about pictures and colors

1296
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:36,833
and let's do this. So thank you
guys for having me.

1297
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:38,893
Bekah: Thanks Abby.

1298
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:39,487
Dan: Thanks Abby.

1299
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:41,532
Bekah: Bye.

1300
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,713
Abbey: Bye bye.

1301
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:49,208
Dan: and there's the awkward by
part. Okay. Bye.

1302
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:49,762
Abbey: Okay.

1303
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:54,510
