00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,169
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season four, episode six of

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:12,589
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah.

3
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,968
And this is a podcast that
features members of the

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,888
Virtual Coffee community.
Virtual Coffee is an intimate

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,388
group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey.

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,669
And they're here on this
podcast, sharing their stories

7
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:27,449
and what they've learned. And we
are here to share

8
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,309
it with you here with me. Today
is my cohost Dan.

9
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:33,106
Dan: Thanks Bekah! Today, we
talked

10
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:35,865
with Bryan Healey. Along with
being one of

11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:38,746
the original members of Virtual
Coffee, Bryan

12
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:40,996
is an entrepreneur, tech leader,
data scientist,

13
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:42,316
machine learning engineer, and
business developer.

14
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:46,125
He's helped create or grow
several startups, raised money

15
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:49,066
and built managed teams of
varying sizes, small to large.

16
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:51,646
And he's currently CTO of a
FinTech company.

17
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:56,595
He co-founded called Aiera.
Bryan has had a long

18
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:59,295
and interesting career, and he's
been in a lot

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:02,956
of different roles. He's being
hired as an engineer,

20
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:04,605
hiring and managing others and
founding entirely new companies.

21
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,665
His experiences have given him a
unique approach to

22
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,796
decision-making that he was kind
enough to sit

23
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:10,965
down and share with us

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,141
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

25
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,820
Like we start every Virtual
Coffee.

26
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,881
We introduce ourselves with our
name, where we're

27
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,421
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:36,790
We hope you enjoy this episode.
Today's random check-in

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:39,150
question is if it were possible,
would you live on the moon?

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm Bekah, I'm a front end
developer from a small town in

31
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:52,329
Ohio, and not live on the moon.
I feel like there are plenty

32
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:53,739
of spaces in the Earth that we
have not explored yet.

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,659
And so I would like to start
there.

34
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,075
Dan: Um, like what.

35
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,129
Bekah: The deep sea.

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,959
Dan: Bottom of the ocean. Okay.

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,719
Bekah: Where the aliens live.

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,020
Dan: Uh, hi, I'm Dan. I live in
Cleveland.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,439
I do development of many kinds,
I suppose.

40
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,139
And, uh, yeah, I don't like the
moon as it exists right now

41
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:22,870
seems pretty, you know, boring
and empty and all that stuff.

42
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,659
Right. But I've read like a
number

43
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,949
of different books that are set
sort of in the

44
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:30,680
future where the moon is... you
know, populated to different

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,409
levels or whatever, you know? So
I would consider it in, in

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,319
those cases, it depends on, you
know, like what they got going

47
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,210
on there, you know, do they have
like movie, if they have

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,210
like movie theaters and, you
know, uh, restaurants and stuff,

49
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,979
you know, if it's like that kind
of thing, uh, then yeah.

50
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,340
But if it's just like all just
like tents and science

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,259
people, and then it's less
interesting to me, to you,

52
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,400
you know, but I do like
exploring like, you know, new

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
areas and hiking and stuff, so
that, that could be cool.

54
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,889
Plus the jumping always looks
always looks fun. Yeah.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,650
Bekah: vertical would increase.
I really think so.

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:01,669
Dan: I would hope

57
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:01,849
Bryan: Quite

58
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,090
Dan: Yeah.

59
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:06,905
Bryan: Yeah. Go, uh, I'm Bryan
Healey.

60
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,215
I'm a entrepreneur in Boston,
mass.

61
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:12,694
Um, and I currently am a
co-founder and CTO at

62
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:19,115
a company called Aiera. And per
the moon, I'm going

63
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:22,460
to go with probably no. Um, I'm
in the same camp as

64
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,310
Dan, like, if, if, if it's built
out, like we're talking

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,469
future moon with like colonies
and like tons of stuff then

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,830
okay, maybe, but even then I
feel like I have my option, I

67
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,830
prefer like Mars over the moon.

68
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,909
Bekah: Mars. Okay.

69
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,300
Bryan: yeah,

70
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,620
Bekah: So maybe the question
should have

71
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,599
been like outer space. somewhere

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,650
Bryan: Absolutely. Yeah,

73
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,219
Bekah: cowboy.

74
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,419
Bryan: we're going somewhere

75
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:42,905
Dan: Why? Why is the Mar why is
Mars better than the moon?

76
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,844
Bryan: Uh, just slightly more
stuff.

77
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,305
Like it's like probably had
water at one point.

78
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,895
They'll be more to investigate.
It's got a little

79
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:50,264
Dan: Uh,

80
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:55,004
Bryan: uh, you know, it's got
mountains and glaciers and,

81
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,555
you know, whereas the moments
like once you've seen 100

82
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,884
square feet you're just looking
at different types of rocks.

83
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,794
Dan: Just different craters.
Yeah, that makes sense.

84
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:03,305
That makes sense.

85
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:09,215
Bekah: Yeah. Um, welcome Bryan.
We're really, really excited to

86
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:12,844
have you on the podcast today.
For those of you who don't

87
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:15,935
know Bryan, he is one of the
first people to ever

88
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:19,954
come to Virtual Coffee. And so
has been around a

89
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:21,454
really long time because of
Bryan, we have a slack.

90
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:25,464
Um, so you, you all owe that to
Bryan.

91
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:29,225
Um, this is long overdue. I feel
like.

92
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,295
So thanks for being here.

93
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:31,464
Bryan: yeah, happy to..

94
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,704
Bekah: so we always start off
with kind of your origin story,

95
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:40,595
your background, and a little
bit about what got you to this

96
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,365
place where you are today.

97
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,360
Bryan: Just generally like my
career?

98
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,379
Um, you know, I probably had one
of the more straightforward

99
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,379
career paths in tech. You know,
I, I went to

100
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,250
college for computer science
right out of high school.

101
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:57,519
I went to Northeastern
University, uh, here in Boston.

102
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,379
Um, studied Computer Science and
jumped right into,

103
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,180
you know, working at a startup
while I was there.

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,259
I actually, so the, the actual
path of my career, uh, was I.

105
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,425
Northeastern has this sort of
five-year program where

106
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:14,634
you, you actually do work
interspersed with academics.

107
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,915
So you six months in school, six
months on an actual,

108
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,165
like, uh, like industry job.

109
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,730
Dan: That's cool.

110
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:22,975
Bryan: Yeah. it was pretty cool.
I didn't even realize how

111
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:25,454
cool it was at the time. I
thought it was just like,

112
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:27,865
ah, money, you know, as, as, as
a older adult, I'm

113
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:30,355
like, damn, that was a, a big
leg up in terms of like

114
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:33,355
how the future progressed. Um,
but so I did a,

115
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:34,704
I did two, like more traditional
internships.

116
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:38,584
Six-month internships. Um,
Goldman Sachs and WR Grace.

117
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,615
So fairly large large-ish
companies.

118
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:45,355
Um, then, uh, in the intervening
period before my third one,

119
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,564
I actually started a small, uh,
startup, uh, in my dorm.

120
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:51,665
Um, ironically, it was of a
silly thing.

121
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:56,620
It was a notetaking shareable
notetaking social network for

122
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,009
like other college students. I
was trying to actually

123
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:02,800
pitch it Facebook style to like
the university would

124
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:05,829
sponsor it and to cover fees and
everyone's sort of

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,290
joined in, uh, it did okay. It
was sort of making a little

126
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:11,560
money, um, but ultimately I
actually kind of got

127
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:14,379
Acqui-hired into my, uh, uh,
second role, which is

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,295
working at another startup in
Boston called Garment Valet,

129
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:21,264
which was sort of the, luxury
delivery, uh, laundry service.

130
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:23,365
Uh, and so they had this pitch
where they were trying to create

131
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,165
like a national brand out of it,
and they were going to

132
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:28,194
create like a central tech hub
that sorta managed, uh, almost

133
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:30,564
like Uber style, like drivers
across the country would,

134
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,665
would work for different shops.
And it would sort of.

135
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,704
You know, work somewhat
independently, but

136
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:41,345
centrally managed. Uh, and so I
joined them as

137
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:44,095
my third before graduation. and
they ended up staying there.

138
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,995
So I was there for like three
and a half years building out

139
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:48,904
their platform scales from like
three people to 25 people.

140
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:54,064
Um, Yeah. And so, I mean, can
obviously

141
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:56,584
keep going for forever. I don't
know how far

142
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:56,584
you want me to take my

143
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:58,725
Bekah: Well, I just like want to
pause for a second.

144
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,985
Cause you're like, oh, I have a
traditional path

145
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:05,995
into where I am today. And you
were like, I started

146
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:08,425
this startup in my dorm room and
then I worked at another

147
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:11,014
startup that was acquired. And
I'm not sure that

148
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:14,964
that's the traditional path. And
I think that's the

149
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:17,454
very Bryan Healey path of doing
all of these things

150
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:19,105
and just like, all right, going
to keep going with it.

151
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,180
Bryan: Fair fair. Yeah. Maybe
traditional

152
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:25,149
is the wrong word. I should've
said more like

153
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,149
I didn't career transition.

154
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:25,985
Bekah: Yeah,

155
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,089
Bryan: I was just like straight
into tech, like ran out of the

156
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,680
Dan: did.

157
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,759
Bryan: Yeah, it definitely,
probably not truly traditional

158
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,680
from like what most people
experience, which is just like,

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,990
get a degree, get the first job
and sort of March from there.

160
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,774
Bekah: Well, and so you've
always been involved in

161
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:40,464
the startup life then. So it's
been startup

162
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:42,894
after startup. And then, so at
some point

163
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:44,754
you transitioned from somebody
else's startup

164
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:46,144
to your own startup. So where's
that happening.

165
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:50,199
Bryan: Yeah. I mean, I I'll
quickly caveat

166
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:52,899
that by saying that I didn't
realize this was potentially

167
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,519
unusual until I was older, but
I've always had that bug in me.

168
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,810
I think I was starting
businesses when I

169
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,589
was eight years old. Like I was
always

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,589
been  doing thing.

171
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,774
Bekah: Eight year Bryan's
business.

172
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:00,665
Thats what I want to know.

173
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:04,149
Bryan: Yeah. So, well, like for
instance,

174
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:05,800
like random, uh, story in that
vein, but I'll

175
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,490
only tell one of them. So when I
was.

176
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,870
10 years old, I started a lawn
care service in the

177
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,089
neighborhood, but I hired all of
the neighborhood

178
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,379
kids to work for me.

179
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:15,625
Dan: amazing.

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,269
Bryan: and essentially got about
30 houses in the neighborhood.

181
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,790
Just sort of sign up for this
like kids lawn service.

182
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,370
And, uh, and I would take cuts
at everybody doing care for

183
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:31,675
Dan: That's awesome. What, what,
like, where

184
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,184
did you learn to do that? Or
think that

185
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,075
way, you know, that early.

186
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,440
Bryan: the weird thing. I just
sort of like.

187
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,149
I mean, I, I, I must've learned
from somewhere, I guess, but

188
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,889
I don't have a clear vision in
my head of where, I mean,

189
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,879
I'd probably just observed

190
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:43,235
Dan: Um,

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,514
Bekah: Twain.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,690
Bryan: yeah, yeah. Just think
observed other

193
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,591
people doing things and you're
like, I could do that.

194
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,211
Um, so yeah, that's my random
aside. So.

195
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,645
So the progression from how I
got to college

196
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:58,505
to my own startup. Um, I, I
won't tell the whole

197
00:08:54,905 --> 00:09:03,995
story cause I I've had a lot of
gigs in my career, I think

198
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:07,505
not eight, eight gigs in total.
Um, but the gist of it is

199
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:10,280
that I've I've sort of to the
startup space in general,

200
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,291
at the very least sort of like
innovation space.

201
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:15,410
I I've had a couple of tiny
stints at bigger companies,

202
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,240
but usually it was in a very
specific capacity.

203
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,870
So like I did a stint at Amazon
in 2013 to 2016.

204
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,230
Um, uh, but I joined
specifically to work on

205
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,951
the, uh, Echo Alexa project.
Cause it was like an,

206
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,301
it was a brand new division in
the business.

207
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:35,211
I was one of the first 50 hires.
I got to sort of like

208
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:36,250
play entrepreneur inside of a
big beast.

209
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,311
Uh, and that was its own kind of
fun other than like

210
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:43,551
random deviations like that.
I've mostly been around

211
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,890
startups, either help try to
find them or

212
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:49,971
just join very early. like from,
from the startup,

213
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:55,221
I joined in college art LA um, I
jumped to another startup

214
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:59,900
as the hire, called shape up,
um, and was there from six

215
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:00,951
people to, I think about 75
people, something like that.

216
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,431
Um, jumped from there to another
startup, uh, Uh, sort of a later

217
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,640
stage startup, I think I was
like the 52nd higher, but it

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,520
was another like, um, that vein,
they were like four years old.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,890
Um, whose name actually escapes
me now.

220
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,980
They were up in Waltham. Um, and
then from there, I,

221
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:21,711
actually tried to start a
startup of my own, a company

222
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,571
called JoinVester essentially
early days of like crowdfunding.

223
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,740
I was trying to start up sort of
like a republic.co style

224
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,740
company, trying to get people to
sell their startup shares

225
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:37,880
on an exchange using, um, very
new regulation called, oh no.

226
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,160
What was it called? oh, that's
going to bug me

227
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,961
is actually a name for it. It's
kind of a cool name,

228
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,921
but it's just been so long. It's
like out of my head now.

229
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,895
Yeah, I ended up bringing on two
co-founders while I was

230
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:53,586
doing that, we a little bit of
seed money and we sort of were

231
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,245
talking to investors and sort of
try and get things going.

232
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,296
We never quite got it up to like
launch.

233
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,635
There was all kinds of questions
around the regulation.

234
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,826
Is this going to last there's a
lot of opposition to it.

235
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,706
Is it worth investing in
companies to sign

236
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,855
up was a challenge. Anyone who
is a really

237
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,655
high value would of course just
go range, venture

238
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:12,186
raise venture dollars. And so it
was like

239
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:14,566
getting quality deals. Do you
have the platform was

240
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:17,535
that was a bit of a stretch. So
that for about two years,

241
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:22,941
but never really took off. Um,
and it was from there

242
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:26,510
that I, uh, Jumped to another
startup called name May Media

243
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:29,691
in other ones that like late
stage startup, I think I was

244
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,671
like the 60th employee they were
like four years old.

245
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:34,760
It was like pre IPO. and I was
there through

246
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:36,711
them getting acquired. And then
from there

247
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:39,350
I jumped to Amazon. And so
that's sort of

248
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,890
where the next piece of it sort
of takes off.

249
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,441
So while I was at Amazon, I
ended up getting recruited

250
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:45,530
into being the AI director at a
company called Lola.

251
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:49,535
Which is, uh, if you know
anything about kayak.com

252
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:52,296
was founded by this guy, Paul
English, um, he's

253
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:56,735
a big name in Boston. I'm not
sure how, how far his

254
00:11:53,405 --> 00:12:00,066
sort of like presence reaches in
the wider US tech community,

255
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:04,035
but he's a big deal here. um, so
he co-founded Kayak after

256
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:06,696
he sold Kayak to Priceline. He
started Lola as

257
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:10,025
I, this new venture
conversational, um, base.

258
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,846
So like, it's sort of like an
automated travel agent

259
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:17,105
was the original pitch. So you
can. I have the experience

260
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:18,966
of personalized travel agency
without having to

261
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,826
physically go anywhere, even
talk to a real human, you

262
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:22,625
could just do it through, this
digital experience.

263
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:27,515
Um, and so I joined there
through that whole experience.

264
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:31,096
I got connected with my current
co-founder Ken Sena.

265
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:34,895
He was, uh, a senior at a
company called Evercore.

266
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:40,791
Uh, and then later Wells Fargo.
As an analyst, which basically

267
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:44,181
he's sort of a financial pro.
He, he, um, advises

268
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:45,201
big funds and firms on how to
invest in money.

269
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,561
Um, and through connecting with
him, uh, we ended up

270
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,990
co-founding Aiera, which was
sort of like this, um,

271
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:54,951
AI enabled platform to help
analysts do their job better.

272
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,615
Make smarter decisions. days of
Aiera, it was

273
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:02,196
actually literally making
predictions, trying to sort

274
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:04,926
of like do the analyst job of
writing research and sort

275
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:12,755
of making recommendations. and
it has evolved more into

276
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:15,186
like, um, a pro's, uh, Suite of
services to help them do

277
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:17,946
the job on the edges better. We,
including the big

278
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:21,216
centerpiece of ours is events.
So we connect to calls,

279
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:23,076
conferences, things that
investors care about

280
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:24,035
and pay attention to and make
decisions on.

281
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,035
And we them and analyze them and
make it easier

282
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,135
for investors sort of like
handle that workflow.

283
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:34,855
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. So
all of this experience,

284
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:37,436
it sounds like you've got to
play a lot of different

285
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:44,946
roles, which seems really. Fun.
I'd love to know maybe like

286
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:47,706
your best experience was or, or
what made you, what

287
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:50,645
were you most excited about
doing throughout this period?

288
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,451
Bryan: really hard to pick a
favorite experience.

289
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:56,150
Cause it's, it's more like
there's been a suite of

290
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,431
things that have all just been
different in different ways.

291
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:00,230
And I have highlights from all
of them.

292
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,691
So I get sort of give some of
those top line highlights.

293
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:07,971
I mean, like for instance, uh,
joining Shape Up, was,

294
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,030
was a specific experience. So
prior to Shapeup I had

295
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:13,461
been in this other startup, but
that other, it was more

296
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,740
of a grind, you know, like I
joined as the third employee,

297
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:17,270
it took three and a half years
to get up to 27 employees.

298
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,571
And then the, you know, 2008
recession the business.

299
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,600
and so it was just like slow
grinding process of

300
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,510
like building a business a much
more like ground level,

301
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,740
like functional business. They
actually had like trucks

302
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:32,360
and drivers and felt more like
real world, if that makes sense.

303
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,061
To join ShapeUp was the, my
first experience

304
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:38,120
on like a rocket ship. Like I
joined a company

305
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:40,130
that sold digital products. So
there was, it was just

306
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,831
an office and servers. I joined
as the third

307
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:47,721
employee and in a year we hired
50 people and then

308
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:49,610
was just like this curve. And
while I was there,

309
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,451
we raised a ton of money. Um,
and we hired a new CEO, a

310
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:57,806
new CTO, and like, it was just.
It was a firehose of crazy

311
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:58,806
every single day for the whole
time I was there.

312
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,505
Um, and even after I left, I got
to watch them.

313
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,875
I stayed in touch with people
and they just kept rocketing.

314
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,816
And eventually they got acquired
for big dollars by Virgin Group.

315
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:11,615
So that experience, think
colored a lot of the rest

316
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,686
of my career of like, oh, this
is what I like.

317
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,666
This is fun. I enjoy the
intensity of it.

318
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,336
know, even things that might not
even seem fun in the moment.

319
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:20,225
Like we had a couple of
stretches where we had product

320
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,745
launches with deadlines and I'm
literally sleeping at the

321
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:25,535
office for 24 hours a day for
like four or five days in a row.

322
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,145
And it's like at the, in the
moment I might've hated that.

323
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,846
in hindsight, it's like, that's
an experience that

324
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,936
like is hard to reproduce in a
successful way.

325
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:37,025
Um, and so sort of colored my
realization that.

326
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:39,645
Me being around startups. Wasn't
just a convenience.

327
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,775
This is where I like to thrive
this, you know, I've

328
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,105
done the biggest, bigger company
thing and internships,

329
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:50,355
and like, this is the fun. Um,
and then, oh, go ahead.

330
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,796
Bekah: I was just gonna say, it
seems like so many

331
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:55,145
different personality types.
There's there's a fit for that.

332
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:58,475
Right? So there are people that
would thrive in

333
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:02,916
that startup atmosphere. There
are people that will

334
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:05,316
thrive something that's more
like a nine to five, and this

335
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,696
is the same things that we do
pretty much every day.

336
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,936
So it's really dependent on like
who you are as a person.

337
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:16,100
Bryan: Yeah, exactly. Right.
And, and if I, if it's

338
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:19,370
possible, my advice to younger
engineers is almost

339
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,370
always to do a stint at each

340
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:19,875
Bekah: Um,

341
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,380
Bryan: sort of get that
experience level.

342
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,780
people just know themselves well
enough, and that is that's Okay.

343
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,951
you truly are like, now I know I
would hate that nine to five,

344
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,370
like clock-in, clock-out do my
job kind of thing or vice versa

345
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,561
that that's good to know that,
but if you have any sort of

346
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:38,000
questioning tech is, is somewhat
unique in the world of work.

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,821
And that is very common and not
at all judged to do like

348
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,961
year or two years stints. So you
can sort of do some

349
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,120
stuff first and sort of build up
a bit of a resume and build

350
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:49,490
up a bit of an experience cash
and be like, okay, I,

351
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,750
now I kind of know what I like
and saying, then you Target.

352
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,091
Yeah.

353
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:57,100
Bekah: thought about that. That
idea that it's normal to

354
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,100
move from place place after

355
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,966
Bryan: Yeah, especially. Yeah.
You know, once you get

356
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:03,456
to really senior level, just
start rising to like

357
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:05,796
director VP C-suite stuff. Now
it becomes more like, well,

358
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:07,865
we expect you to be stable.
You're here as a leader, but

359
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:10,355
when you're in the junior C made
an even early senior

360
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:12,066
levels, it's sort of like,
you're just a gun for hire

361
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:14,046
in most of these places. So it's
not judged

362
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,915
during usual if you're sort of
jumping around.

363
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:17,766
Um, you know, I think the only
mark I ever see is sometimes

364
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,715
people like I'd like to see at
least a year, you know,

365
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:20,675
Bekah: Yeah.

366
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,266
Bryan: so they can at least
stick around for a couple

367
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,695
of projects and, you know, see
some things through to

368
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:25,945
production before they move on.

369
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,756
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. So,
okay.

370
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,605
So kind of like along those
lines, do you ever hit

371
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:35,776
that burnout point though? Like,
I feel like

372
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:40,605
there's gotta be a point. It may
be, it's not hour

373
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:43,215
spent, but the just not there.
And you're like, why am

374
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:45,435
I doing this anymore? Or have
you just always

375
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:47,175
found that like, okay, I've got
momentum, that's

376
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:48,506
carrying me forward. And I'm
excited about this.

377
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,786
Bryan: Yeah. don't know if this
is

378
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:54,066
unusual, my suspicion as it is,
but for some reason

379
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:58,355
I do have like bottomless energy
and always have, so

380
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:59,375
I've never really experienced
burnout in the classic way.

381
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,395
People describe burnout. I will
say I've experienced

382
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:06,336
things, similar burnout, and
it's almost always oriented

383
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:07,266
around how excited I am when
things are going on.

384
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:10,355
know, we've talked about this in
other forums.

385
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,895
I'm a, I'm a ADHD even diagnosed
as a child.

386
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,715
And so I have that sort of like
dopamine fixation of like,

387
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:23,226
I need something to me in. If
you can latch that,

388
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:24,215
then I'll go 24, 7, 365 at full
speed all the time.

389
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:26,976
And I, and I can just. Sustain
that energy.

390
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:30,365
Uh, as soon as I start to lose
that though, I start to

391
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,496
lose the ability to sort of
maintain that just because.

392
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,060
Connection problem, my brain.
And so most times when I've

393
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,171
experienced it, it usually just
means I'm ready to move on.

394
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,090
Like the company I'm at is no
longer at a place where

395
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,601
it's really engaging me. And I'm
sort of starting to

396
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,891
work on side projects more than
I'm working on my main project.

397
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:49,010
And, um, and, uh, and I'm ready
for the next big challenge.

398
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,351
So it's, it hasn't happened to
me much in my career with

399
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,330
a few times it's happened.
That's been the result.

400
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,010
It's like, okay, it's time for a
next big thing

401
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,911
that's going to excite me.

402
00:18:56,695 --> 00:19:01,826
Dan: When you're, you know, um,
I have similar, you know, like

403
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,445
a, a similar situation going on.
Yeah.

404
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,645
Um, but the, my question was,
um, you know, knowing that about

405
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,276
yourself, did that enter in the,
your decision making process

406
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:16,405
about starting a company now? So
now you're like, you know,

407
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:19,746
a co-founder of a company and
maybe it feels like you might

408
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:22,101
be a little less like able to.
Hop out, uh, you know,

409
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:24,500
you know what I mean? And I was
wondering if I was

410
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:25,280
wondering if that entered in
when you're thinking about it.

411
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,760
And also like, now that you're,
how long has, how long, I'm

412
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,820
sorry, how long has, uh,

413
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,500
Bryan: uh,

414
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:30,951
Dan: and

415
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:33,681
Bryan: at Aiera uh, we're about
three half years

416
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:37,351
Dan: three interviews? Yeah. So
like two parts of

417
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:39,270
that question, I guess, you
know, before, when

418
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:43,411
you're thinking about it. And
then now, you know, now

419
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,691
does that thought ever like
creep up or, you know, like

420
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:46,621
how would you like approach that
in this situation?

421
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,590
Cause you're not any more a gun
for hire or whatever.

422
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:54,036
Bryan: yeah, for sure. It
definitely changes that

423
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:56,076
capacity too, if I ever did feel
so to like the urge to

424
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:58,865
like move on, it would be
considerably harder, but th

425
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:01,115
there's sort of a caveat to that
is which is, this is my thing.

426
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:05,645
And so like, I can kind of the
direction, um, and you know,

427
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:11,855
It's, it allows me to be more
flexible than I'd be able to

428
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:17,165
be in more traditional roles.
And so there are still

429
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:19,445
of course, boundaries
self-imposed boundaries for

430
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:21,576
like what the business is. We
can't pivot all the time and

431
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:23,675
we have investors and you have
to make good smart decisions

432
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:30,651
about how to run the business.
Um, but you know, My

433
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:33,921
ability to contribute to the
business has been able to

434
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:36,830
be as flexible as necessary,
both for my own ability to

435
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:39,770
contribute and my ability to
sort of empower the team

436
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,260
to, to what they need to do. And
so, know, my

437
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,280
role has shifted over time from
being like.

438
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:46,846
Primary full-time ML engineer
working on a prediction product

439
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:51,226
being mostly a sales tool and
business developer to moving

440
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:54,796
back into like where the R and D
style role working on, uh,

441
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:58,125
NL projects that are on the, on
the front burner of demand,

442
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,215
but are important for like
long-term value generation.

443
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:05,026
And so being able to sort of
like set my own vision and sort

444
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,816
of work with the team, opposed
to like, here's your project,

445
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:12,500
you're working on X and. As well
as sort of influenced,

446
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:15,530
I think that balance a little
bit, all that being

447
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:21,560
said is worth caveating. That,
and this is somewhat

448
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:25,161
funny to admit, almost all of my
career from college

449
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,421
to now has had a remarkably
small amount of planning.

450
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,810
It's mostly just been like, Hey,
that's exciting.

451
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,800
Hey, that's interesting. And
just sort of

452
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,800
like moving w where

453
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:35,060
Bekah: We're all method, right?

454
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,871
Bryan: exactly.

455
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:38,806
Dan: That also sounds very
familiar to me.

456
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,240
Bekah: Yeah.

457
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,925
Bryan: For sure. And so I, I
confess to say

458
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:47,736
that I think very little of that
was pre thought like,

459
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:48,395
oh, I should be careful here.
This is a start up.

460
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,355
You know, it was just more like

461
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,191
Dan: Totally.

462
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,965
Bryan: this now. This is
exciting.

463
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:56,431
Dan: Yeah. no, I there's a lot
in like,

464
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,471
you know, I I've, I don't, it
start-ups, but I've been

465
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:01,211
just independent, you know, my,
my whole career as well,

466
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:04,681
you know, and I think that I
find that a lot of people, um,

467
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,381
especially people with ADHD that
are been in the industry

468
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:10,151
for a long time, I, I think are
gravitate towards these sort

469
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:12,546
of situations where there's
yeah, in control a little

470
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:15,455
bit more of their own, uh, their
own destiny, you know?

471
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,570
Bryan: Yeah, A little more, you
just a little

472
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,540
bit more in control of how you
can direct your injury.

473
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,175
Dan: absolutely. I think that's
right.

474
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,586
It's really important cool.

475
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:30,465
Bekah: Oh, sorry. I, So did you
decide, like

476
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:33,046
you were ready to start your own
thing or was that, I

477
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:34,786
mean, I imagine that can't be
really impulsive, right?

478
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,855
There's gotta be some thought
process.

479
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,865
You on a co-founder.

480
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:41,165
Dan: Yeah.

481
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:45,861
Bryan: well, th a there's,
there's genuinely kind of

482
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:51,980
two answers to that actually.
Um, the process by how moved

483
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,740
into and out of startups of my
own creation, I've,

484
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,111
I've, I've attempted or
successfully created my own

485
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,951
startup, like four times. Um,
uh, I'd say two

486
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,270
of those were genuine successes
of some capacity.

487
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,090
Every one of them kind of evolve
the same way, including

488
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,560
Aiera which is that I've never
really been anywhere.

489
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,520
That wasn't my company where I
wasn't working

490
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,691
on lots of side projects. I
just, I'm the type that

491
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,340
can't really sit still. So when
I'm, when I'm done

492
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:22,911
the work for the day and I'm
home and I'm working on

493
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,911
something else and scaling
effect is when is sort of in

494
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,723
my mind, when am I spending.
When  am I almost doing two

495
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:28,535
jobs?

496
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:30,455
Like when does it move from like
a 10 hour a week?

497
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:33,215
Like having fun side project to
like, this is a thing, and

498
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:36,816
it's really showing traction and
there's excitement around it.

499
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:40,385
You know, um, building Aiera um,
there was a good

500
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,625
six month period where I was
still in my other job.

501
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,715
but Aiera was consuming a lot of
time.

502
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,905
Like I was doing like sales runs
and going to

503
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,715
New York and pitching. And like,
it was, it was a

504
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:53,945
meaningful thing that I had
built entirely on the side.

505
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,125
Uh, and so there is, there is a
decision point

506
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,976
where you're like, I could
probably just do this now.

507
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:05,046
Um, but that does genuinely just
kind of appear like

508
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,155
the, for me, it's always been
just like, there's literally

509
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,756
a day where I'm like, I should
just be doing this.

510
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:11,855
This is really what I'm enjoying
doing the rest of

511
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,655
the thing, you just paying bills
and adding stuff to

512
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:18,635
the bottom, bottom line. And so
it's time to shift with

513
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:21,365
the process of getting there is
very organic for me, at

514
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:24,546
least like I've just always got
another thing going that

515
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:25,326
I'm excited about and want to
see if it goes somewhere.

516
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:27,816
And most of them, peter out,
most of them don't go anywhere,

517
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:31,516
but you just keep trying stuff
and number I've probablty

518
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,046
started projects of some kind
that I thought might go

519
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:38,645
somewhere 20 twenty-five times.
And most of them don't

520
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:39,935
know where they just, they just
sort of languish.

521
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:41,796
And then I closed them down
after awhile, but

522
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:48,635
Dan: Um, do you have any. About,
like how to, how

523
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:50,586
to consider those projects that,
uh, you know,

524
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:53,976
that don't go anywhere. I I've,
I've heard and also

525
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:56,855
experienced, you know, some like
people expressing, you know,

526
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:58,536
shame or whatever about, you
know, some side project they

527
00:24:56,855 --> 00:25:01,625
wouldn't know, or, you know,
it's, it's still there and it's,

528
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:05,286
you know, like that sort of
thing, you know, like, and, and

529
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:07,625
you seem, I'm asking because you
seem like very comfortable

530
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:08,826
and, and, you know, feel good
about it, about the situation.

531
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:10,865
You know what I mean? I was
like, wondering

532
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,455
how you approach that, like, uh,
like the.

533
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:16,461
Um, you know, I think people
sometimes avoid starting

534
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,310
side projects because they don't
want to make something

535
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,070
that is going to fail or, you
know, for instance,

536
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:28,431
Bryan: I mean, The, the, the
unfortunate

537
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:31,730
answer is some of it. I don't
know how to, to

538
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,990
answer other than just like,
don't be shameful.

539
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,550
I know that it's a terrible
thing to say.

540
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,951
It's like telling somebody don't
be sad, you know, but

541
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,931
like, this is an element of that
where I've just never

542
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,851
really felt a problem with that.
I liked to do stuff.

543
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:44,635
And when things don't work out,
I'm very failure comfortable, I

544
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,566
guess is the way I describe it.
Like

545
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:46,151
Dan: Yeah.

546
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:48,836
Bryan: things don't, I, in fact,
I almost have this, um,

547
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:53,365
it might be almost a negative. I
haven't quite decided,

548
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:55,705
uh, in my own self analysis, but
like when things

549
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:56,695
don't work out, I'm really
comfortable going like, okay.

550
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:59,421
And then never think about it
it's like, I can just

551
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:02,451
completely move on once. I've
decided that something's

552
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,540
not going to work and like right
up until that point,

553
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:06,530
I will be doing like 110% to try
to make something work.

554
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,260
And it's like this weird thing I
can do where I'm

555
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,060
just like, okay, I've decided it
won't work.

556
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:11,601
And I move on,

557
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:12,346
Dan: that.

558
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,121
Bryan: in terms of like, but
other than that potentially.

559
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:18,111
Uh, advice, uh, the, the more
practical advice that.

560
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,451
we give is really just around
like perception thing.

561
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,961
Um, the only reason I could
imagine to feel a problem

562
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,911
with it is you're fearful of
like outside perception.

563
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:27,320
Like, does it look like I'm a
failure?

564
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:29,060
I guess it could be internal

565
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:30,175
Dan: Oh yeah, that's

566
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,340
Bryan: but I, now I'm kind of
projecting a

567
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:37,840
Bekah: me out on that. Bryan. I
feel like personally

568
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:42,911
attacked right now. No, I don't
feel like that. it.

569
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,181
Bryan: So it's like, so if it's
an external validation

570
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,340
concern, uh, and I dunno if this
is helpful or not,

571
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,651
but in general, I would say
nobody's going to judge you

572
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:57,455
for that a hundred percent. And
anyone, anyone who might

573
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:59,675
is somebody who's weirdly
thinking about things in

574
00:26:57,486 --> 00:27:03,516
a way I can't wrap my head
around, I don't monitor,

575
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:05,945
people's GitHub accounts.
They're like, oh, they

576
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:06,546
deleted Something's weird going
on there.

577
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,915
Like nobody cares. This is not a
thing. So like, you

578
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:09,105
Bekah: Yeah.

579
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,875
Bryan: from, from a hire, from
like an employer perspective,

580
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:15,605
I like seeing people that are
tinkering and toying and

581
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:17,915
creative, like ultimately we're
in a field that is a

582
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,976
very mental, creative field. I
want to see people

583
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:25,881
who are sort of like. Out there
willing to take

584
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:29,211
chances willing to experiment.
You know, it's a fundamental

585
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:32,240
basis of experimentation is lots
of your experiments,

586
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:34,361
prove your hypothesis wrong.
Like that's what

587
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,391
you're looking for. They all
just proved them. Right.

588
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,721
Then they wouldn't, you know,
something's not right there. So

589
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,121
Bekah: I love that. And I want
to

590
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:40,516
Dan: Yeah.

591
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,671
Bekah: a minute just to make
sure that we emphasize that.

592
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:46,121
So, you know, that idea of loss
projects can be

593
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:49,810
where you can testify. Like,
look, I am

594
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,280
trying new things. I am getting
creative.

595
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,280
I want to push myself beyond
these things.

596
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,111
And I know when it's time to
stop and move

597
00:27:56,111 --> 00:28:01,330
on to the next thing. And that's
a great way to

598
00:27:57,191 --> 00:28:01,330
reframe those experiences.

599
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:05,046
Bryan: it's also worth saying
that like, there's also nothing

600
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:12,516
wrong with, with having ideas.
That linger, like if you're

601
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:15,306
working on something, but it
doesn't yet have sort

602
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:17,256
of like a clear niche and you're
not taking off, but

603
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:17,986
you're not ready to call it.
That's fine too.

604
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:22,655
Can just exist out there. I've
done a small

605
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:23,526
handful of those. I got, I'll
give you a silly one.

606
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,135
out there anymore, but I, uh,
years and years and years

607
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:33,486
ago back in 2007, eight God,
long time ago at this point.

608
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,990
Back in my PhD days, I wrote a
framework and PHP called helium.

609
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:44,566
Uh, you know, mean, I'm
egotistical uh, it was, it

610
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:47,195
was just the standard MVC style
framework, but I spent

611
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:49,655
a ton of time, like just sort of
like pouring  in there.

612
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,746
Um, I had no idea what it was
for.

613
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:57,496
I just like did it to do it. Um,
and so I put a website up

614
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:59,715
with it, through up a GitHub and
I was, uh, I might not

615
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:06,830
have been GitHub back then. It
was SourceForge

616
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:07,851
SourceForge and, uh, And it was
just sort of like, Okay.

617
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:10,911
here's, here's the thing I
built. Maybe it'll be

618
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,040
something interesting. Um, back
then there were

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,381
companies that were sort of
cropping up that was just

620
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,451
selling like frameworks as back
in the very early Django days.

621
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:23,661
Um, you know, the early, um, oh,
what was that PHP site anyway?

622
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,181
Um, but I didn't know what I was
gonna do with it.

623
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,901
So like for, for a solid like
five, six years, it was just

624
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:32,661
a thing that existed that update
a year when I got the

625
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:36,145
motivation and then finally. I
think I'm the only one

626
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,925
that's ever used this. This it's
just my

627
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:39,635
thing basically. And I just
didn't feel

628
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:40,266
like maintaining it as I took it
down.

629
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,566
And that that's fine. It's just
a, it was a

630
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:44,346
toy that I was wanting to see if
it went somewhere.

631
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:45,846
It didn't and that's okay.

632
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:51,580
Bekah: Yeah, I really love that.
I think so this, this is going

633
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:54,611
to be a little bit of a tangent,
but, um, there was, uh, when

634
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:59,351
I was first starting learning
how to code, I went to this,

635
00:29:54,611 --> 00:30:03,161
um, conference online and one of
the talks was about how to

636
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:06,836
monetize your kids hobbeys. And
I was like super kind

637
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:09,385
of grossed out by that. Like,
Hey, why don't we

638
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:12,086
just let kids have fun? But then
as we move into

639
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:15,986
adulthood, like that mentality,
I think that that

640
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:17,125
exemplifies what the mentality
of adulthood is, right?

641
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,955
Like if you have a hobby, you
better be

642
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:23,756
making money off of it. Right.
And like, why not just try some

643
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:27,326
things out and see what happens
with it, or have fun with it

644
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:31,645
and not put all this pressure on
yourself to be founder or to

645
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:35,855
build the new and best thing.
Like you don't have do that

646
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:38,256
thing in all of your projects.
Like sometimes it's just

647
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:40,145
worth pursuing to see like what
comes out of it,

648
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:44,435
Bryan: It's sort of, it's sort
of weird, like, In my

649
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,955
experience, this is just
anecdotal, but in my experience,

650
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:50,165
the vast majority of successful
founders, really aren't people

651
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:53,046
that set out to be founders.
They're just people

652
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:54,096
that do stuff. It just like a do
stuff.

653
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:55,465
Just constantly doing stuff.

654
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:56,395
Bekah: The ADHD people. people

655
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:59,405
Bryan: all the ADHD people. And
it's just like, I

656
00:30:57,576 --> 00:31:00,516
just need, I need, I need
something in front of my face.

657
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,276
That's taking up my, you know,
my attention and,

658
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:06,276
uh, and they just end up, like I
said, they fall into

659
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,090
something lucrative, like. This
is a thing.

660
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:11,191
We have a lot of users. Now,
this is, this is cool.

661
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,681
And you can sort of lean into it
and sort, it takes off.

662
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:18,451
Um, and that's Okay. Like, it's,
I agree with you.

663
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,820
Like, it doesn't have to be
like, oh, how can I make money?

664
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:21,046
Bekah: Okay.

665
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,800
Bryan: I, you know, like, how
can I make money right now?

666
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,441
What can I do to convert this? I
mean, obviously money's

667
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,310
important part of life and your
job and all that,

668
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:26,526
Bekah: Yeah.

669
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,161
Bryan: you're, you're focusing
really just being

670
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,500
more on doing things and, and I
think it can be...

671
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,076
even that's a little bit, want
to make sure I'm

672
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,365
not being disingenuous. Cause
like I'm always

673
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:38,586
wanting to found a company. I'm
an entrepreneur mindset.

674
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,346
It's more just like, how do
those two mix together?

675
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:45,125
My mindset is that, yes. I like
being entrepreneurial

676
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:48,546
and I wanna, I wanna take things
somewhere, but it's

677
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:51,276
like, I'm not going to a legal
pad and going like,

678
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:53,526
okay, my next business idea. You
know, it's just, more

679
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:55,715
like in the back of my head, I
know that's where I might

680
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:56,726
take everything eventually. Like
that's what I'm tinkering.

681
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,165
But in the moment I'm just
tinkering and then

682
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:00,546
we'll see what lands

683
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,605
Bekah: I've talked to a number
of people who are in like the

684
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:06,185
more senior portion of their
career in the past couple

685
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:11,401
of months have just felt. You
know, they've hit what

686
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:13,941
we often refer to as burnout.
And I've, I've said like,

687
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:16,590
you know, I think your bored,
like this was interesting

688
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,641
when you got started and I see
it all the time.

689
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:20,580
Like it is interesting and you
push forward and

690
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,671
you do these new things. And
then at some point.

691
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,701
You stopped doing all of the new
things, right.

692
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:28,101
It gets a little bit slower and
you're working

693
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:33,770
on the same things. then it
just, it becomes hard

694
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:36,230
like in, in honestly, like it's,
it's a place where a lot

695
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,691
of people experienced mental
health issues where they start

696
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:42,861
to become depressed because they
don't have that same

697
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:44,421
like or like that momentum for
that keeps them going.

698
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,905
And then it just kind of like.
Oh, that thing that you've

699
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:49,955
invested so much time in, that's
given you energy.

700
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:53,885
It's not like sucking all of
that energy out and like,

701
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:58,566
Hey, it's time to move on. Like,
whether you don't have to

702
00:32:55,566 --> 00:33:01,506
find the perfect project, but
find something that's better

703
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,506
than what you're doing.

704
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:08,915
Bryan: Totally. Yeah. And, and
you can, you know,

705
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:11,855
I always feel like a little bit,
I, I'm not calling anyone

706
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:14,645
specifically, but I hear a lot
of things when I, when I

707
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:18,276
go to younger engineer forums
and discussion points of like,

708
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:20,925
there's a lot of focus on.
Trying to plan your career.

709
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,715
That makes sense. It's like,
what's the

710
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:26,766
next thing I should do. I'm
looking at all this options,

711
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:27,846
you know, and if that's your
personality type, that's great.

712
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,615
I'm not gonna discourage anyone
to do what works for them.

713
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,806
But in general, I'd say that
there's nothing wrong too,

714
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,355
with quite literally being just
like a rock in a pond, like.

715
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,060
If you see something cool, go
for it. Like this.

716
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,030
There's really no like, oh, is
this a bad career decision?

717
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,990
I don't know, do it anyway.
know, if you're, if you're

718
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,540
working at a company it's not,
not making you

719
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,461
thrilled and you hear what a
startup that just doing

720
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,461
something that intrigued you.
Pursue it, maybe it

721
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,361
doesn't go anywhere. Maybe you
don't get the job.

722
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:54,941
Maybe you get an offer. It's not
good enough, but

723
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:57,941
always be willing to take
chances and just yourself out

724
00:33:54,941 --> 00:34:00,401
there and dive into things. I
think that's the only way

725
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:02,681
to, like you said, avoid that
burnout where you don't feel

726
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:05,020
like you're stuck to a thing.
You can always move

727
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:05,020
anytime you need to.

728
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:09,681
Bekah: Do you ever find that? I
mean, maybe personally, and

729
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:13,701
as a person that like hires
people for the company that

730
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:16,731
you have someone on the team, or
you've been in a situation

731
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:20,601
where it's very exciting
initially, then very quickly

732
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:21,891
they hit that like, oh actually,
maybe this is not for me.

733
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,951
and then what, what do you do in
that situation?

734
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,590
Or, or what advice would you
give.

735
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,326
Bryan: um, well, so there's
probably, there's probably two

736
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:34,056
answers to that, what advice
would I give as the employer

737
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:39,096
trying to retain my talent? I
would, I would probably

738
00:34:35,675 --> 00:34:41,496
encourage them to pick up new
projects internally that they

739
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:44,255
might find more exciting. You
know, what things can,

740
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,726
can we put them on that gets if
the motor moving.

741
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:49,295
From a mentor perspective, not
outside there.

742
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,726
I'd say that there's nothing
wrong with making

743
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:54,036
that realization quick and
starting to look right away.

744
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,965
done that before. I've had, I
have at

745
00:34:55,315 --> 00:35:00,065
least one, maybe two. I'm trying
to really think

746
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:02,675
through my career now, but I
know I had at least one like

747
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:05,630
six months didn't I'm like
resume where I was like nah

748
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:06,630
this isn't, I'm not enjoying
this at all it's time to move.

749
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,481
And I just really looked around
and there's

750
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,481
nothing wrong with that. I think
if you did that

751
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:13,880
repeatedly, like four or five,
six times in a row after a

752
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:17,900
while, it starts to look funny,
but one or two or even three in

753
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,900
a career happens it's normal.

754
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:21,670
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, that's such
good advice.

755
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,610
Like, oh, we find so many people
in that position all

756
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,610
of the time trying to figure out
what they're doing.

757
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,150
And it's a lot of, it's the hang
up on what it's

758
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,021
gonna look like a resume.

759
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:38,195
Bryan: Yeah. And, and, and like,
anything

760
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:40,626
else I'd say that it's sort of,
it's sort of shitty to make

761
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:42,815
this kind of advice, but like,
there does come a point where

762
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:44,016
things like that get weird.
Like, like I said,

763
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,016
if it was six of

764
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:44,431
Bekah: Yeah.

765
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,235
Bryan: as an, employer I might
go, oh, they haven't

766
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:49,536
a one, one year stint in the
last, you know, six jobs.

767
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,815
That's a little weird, but like
there's no magic number where

768
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:54,545
it's like, oh, four is too much.
Like, it's, it's really just.

769
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:58,775
It's really just an eyeball test
of like, how does it look?

770
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,385
And in general, I'd say a few of
those is not a problem that they

771
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:06,126
were bothered me as an employer.
If I see like one or two

772
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:08,945
of those, um, I might ask a
question in the interview, just

773
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:11,045
be like, Hey, I noticed, you
know, you had a, you know, six

774
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:13,715
months didn't, you know, what
happened there all I'm ever

775
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:15,516
looking for is just like, Yeah.
it just wasn't, you know,

776
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:17,376
it wasn't the right fit. The
projects weren't as

777
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:19,266
exciting as I thought. And we
parted ways,

778
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,235
amicably that kind of stuff.
Yeah.

779
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,545
It was like, as long as they
don't get the, oh yeah, I hated

780
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:23,985
my boss kind of answer then.

781
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,721
Bekah: What if they do hate
their boss, what does they have?

782
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:26,590
A terrible boss.

783
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,135
Bryan: Well, has nothing to do
what we've been talking about,

784
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:30,576
Bekah: Okay.

785
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,535
Bryan: like random career
advice. Never say that even if

786
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:34,485
it's

787
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:37,155
true, cause nobody cares and
all, it just makes it look

788
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:38,056
like the wrong answer, even if
it was the right answer.

789
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:40,425
And I can't verify it as an
employer, so it's always

790
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:44,536
like, oh, to hear that one. just
lie to me as an employer.

791
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:47,835
Just, say it was of,

792
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,525
Bekah: What if you don't have a
good lying face?

793
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,940
Bryan: Well, I guess that's
tougher.

794
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,121
Bekah: Turn camera off. I'm
sorry. I'm having issues

795
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,440
with my camera. it was totally
fine.

796
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,581
Bryan: I'll answer this
question.

797
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:06,501
Bekah: I feel like you have a
really good gut

798
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,610
instinct for things. Do you,
would you

799
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,610
agree with that?

800
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:14,090
Bryan: I like to think I do Who
knows how true that is,

801
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,541
but, um, yeah, I think so.

802
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,396
Bekah: And what do you think. I
feel like this is

803
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:24,885
a silly question. Can you
develop a gut instinct?

804
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:30,335
Bryan: Um, I actually think,
yes. Um, I, I just don't

805
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:30,516
know how to teach it. I

806
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:30,945
Bekah: Yeah.

807
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:33,096
Bryan: that you can, you can
develop something you kinda

808
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,675
have to develop on your own it's
cause it kind of also

809
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:37,416
depends what we're talking about
by gut instincts.

810
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:38,706
So there's sort of a couple of
different

811
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:42,786
things that play in that. So
like I have a pretty good

812
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:48,905
read for people in general. I
think, um, and that's,

813
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:50,135
that's, it comes with extreme
risk for bias.

814
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,155
So I always try to

815
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:51,340
Bekah: Yeah,

816
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,985
Bryan: it by looping and lots of
other people.

817
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:55,206
I'm never the final arbiter of
this kind of stuff, unless

818
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,056
it's universally a positive,
like sometimes I'll I have in

819
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:01,025
the past taking a unilateral,
like positive decision, like

820
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:03,005
I'm going to hire this person
because I think they're great.

821
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,951
Um, I, I very rarely, almost
never have taken unilateral.

822
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm not hiring this person
because I don't like them.

823
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,521
Like, I always try to make sure
that I'm mixing in

824
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,710
people to sort of check me on
those kinds of things.

825
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,090
Um, but separating that, that
acknowledged concern for bias.

826
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,490
I do think I have a generally a
good impression of people

827
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:26,721
and sort of what I think they
can do or, or excited to do.

828
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,201
You know how they'll fit in
certain roles.

829
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:35,510
Um, there's also like gut
feeling for just general

830
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,900
things like career things. Does
this company look exciting?

831
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:41,690
Do I think that the leadership
that I am talking to actually

832
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:45,081
sounds good or bad, and guess it
has a little bit fits into

833
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:48,800
the people analysis, but, um,
it's like parallel versus

834
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,951
directly in the same line. Um,
and so a lot of that I think

835
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:57,561
just comes from experience. Like
you can have a decent,

836
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:58,610
like, general intuition for it,
but most of it you just learned.

837
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,070
I've talked to 20 companies in
my career, and these are

838
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,860
the things I keep seeing in
companies that burn out later.

839
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,990
And these are the companies that
keep seeing in

840
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,510
companies who I remember and
have good relationships

841
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,050
with the founders with. And you
sort of like start

842
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:15,331
to develop that checklist of
like what you're looking

843
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,940
for when you're talking to
potential employers or you're

844
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,940
talking to potential employees.

845
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,481
Dan: No.

846
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:22,610
Bekah: is that, that Bryan
Healey book coming

847
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,201
out that specific one.

848
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:28,356
Bryan: Yeah. So ironically, um,
it, it probably needs

849
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:31,655
massively updating. So I
actually, I wrote like

850
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:34,626
I self published it kind of
silly but it was basically

851
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:37,356
just the collection of old
essays on this, these kinds of

852
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:40,266
topics, like years ago, that was
like the kind of crap I

853
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:41,405
see in startups repeatedly. And
I find interesting.

854
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,626
Um, and I I've always wanted to
do one.

855
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,605
on like people too, but that
one's also a little bit.

856
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:47,584
Riskier.

857
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:48,666
Bekah: Yeah.

858
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,751
Dan: No, we got to come up with
a pseudonym for you for

859
00:39:53,751 --> 00:40:00,110
publishing. So that'll be a
Right. Ryan, Ryan feely.

860
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,251
Bryan: feely.

861
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,760
Dan: I don't know.

862
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:05,135
Bryan: It's a name. It's not a
football player.

863
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,135
Oh man. He's like my, uh,
ultimate ego.

864
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,971
Dan: I'm still thinking about
the helium named

865
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:14,871
for that PHP thing is amazing.

866
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:17,135
Bryan: as I ran through, that
was my nickname.

867
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,295
All through grade school was
always Yeah.

868
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:20,076
That's where it came from.

869
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,050
Bekah: That was fantastic. Um,
okay.

870
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,900
So, so through all of this and
what you're working on

871
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,871
at Aiera, you're doing a lot of
machine learning stuff.

872
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,371
And so you know, there's been a
lot of advancements,

873
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,641
I guess, over the past, even
couple of years.

874
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:44,240
And like, how does that, you
think that like, that's part

875
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,380
of what's kept you interested?
Like it keeps growing,

876
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:50,121
it keeps changing. It's a fun
field to be in.

877
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:51,891
And like, but also it's
overwhelming.

878
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:54,260
Cause there's so many changes.
So how do you balance that?

879
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,960
Like, this is cool versus like
a, I don't even

880
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,831
know where to start.

881
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:02,675
Bryan: So machine learning is my
favorite field of any

882
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:05,556
career I've ever been near
specifically because it's just.

883
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:10,641
Lunatically fast-paced like tech
in general is fast paced.

884
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:15,351
Machine learning is insane. I
can't even, actually,

885
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:16,610
uh, I had the, um, a friend of
mine talk about it.

886
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,440
Like we shouldn't talk about
machine learning

887
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,590
engineers, like wine vintages,
like, oh, that's a 2007

888
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:26,440
machine learning engineer. know,
you know,

889
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:29,880
Keras and because. Rapidly you
lose your,

890
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,030
you lose yourself. Like, oh, I
haven't worked

891
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:32,085
in, in Keras in five years.
What's it  working on? Oh my

892
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:34,259
God.

893
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,661
Look at all this stuff. You
know, they come with all

894
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:40,050
these prebuilt models now. Like
everything's just always

895
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,161
moving at such a pace that yes,
it keeps it super exciting.

896
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:43,951
a little stressful, like always
think trying to stay

897
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:45,690
on the cutting edge and learning
new things and

898
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:52,056
keeping up on what's new. Yeah.
But I think, I think you're

899
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:53,135
right in that it, it hits that
side of the brain.

900
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:57,036
That's like, I'm never bored.
There's always something kind

901
00:41:54,335 --> 00:42:02,945
of neat going on in this space.
Um, and yeah, so I'd say that's,

902
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:04,146
that's pretty much the gist of
there and it's sort of funny.

903
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,456
It also fits into the same
medium that tech in general

904
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:10,985
kind of fits for me, is, um, I'm
trying think how to phrase

905
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:13,715
this, but like learning makes me
feel this especially, but really

906
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:16,856
all of tech is that it's not
really an industry in a classic

907
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:17,460
Bekah: Hmm

908
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:21,335
Bryan: It's like it's just there
in everything, you

909
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:23,286
know, there's, there's
healthcare tech, there's legal

910
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:27,005
tech, there's finance tech,
there's, it just, it fits into

911
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:31,385
every vertical pretty much. And
so not like I just sit

912
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:33,576
and code for the sake of code.
I'm always serving an

913
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:37,445
industry of some kind. Uh, and
I, so I can go into

914
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:39,876
any of these and sort of play,
you know, I, in my career, I

915
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:42,606
have worked in health tech. I've
worked in consumer tech,

916
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:44,436
I've worked in retail, I've
worked in voice assistance.

917
00:42:44,465 --> 00:42:48,405
I've worked in FinTech and I've
worked in travel and, and

918
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,815
actually more and more, like,
you just always get to sort of

919
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:56,615
play in these different spaces.
And so both tech and machine

920
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:59,166
learning, especially allow you
to sort of like never get

921
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:01,445
bored in a single space where
you just like, I just know

922
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:03,286
this head to toe and it's not
driving the excitement anymore.

923
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:06,951
Dan: Yeah, I love that. You
know, I've always

924
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:12,110
felt the same way. It's, you
know, it's another,

925
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:15,380
another bonus of either moving,
moving jobs or, you know, being

926
00:43:12,141 --> 00:43:18,920
independent or all that stuff is
like you get into a different

927
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:20,300
job and all of a sudden it's a
whole new domain to learn.

928
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,420
Right. And you don't have to,
like, I don't know.

929
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:27,981
I, we, we work on, um, I don't
know, gas pressure valve, a

930
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,130
company that makes those right.
But I'm like writing

931
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,760
JavaScript and stuff, you know,
but at the same time,

932
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,380
I know a whole lot about gas
pressure that I didn't before.

933
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:40,090
And that sounds like I wouldn't
like say I'm going to, I'm

934
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,360
going to do like chain. Yeah,
exactly.

935
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,170
Like, that's what I mean. It's
like you get to

936
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,190
nerd out about, um, about
something new all the time.

937
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:49,041
Uh, aside from the technology
that you're

938
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,121
actually like building.

939
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:51,695
Bryan: And to your point,
without having to make

940
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,226
the commitment being

941
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,260
Dan: Right, right.

942
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:56,226
Bryan: I have to change careers
to learn

943
00:43:56,346 --> 00:43:57,065
Dan: Right, right, right,

944
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:57,155
Bryan: you

945
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:00,425
Dan: right. Yeah. No, no. I'm
not going back to school and

946
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:03,215
becoming, you know, some sort of
mechanical engineer and learning

947
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:05,945
about gas lines and stuff. It,
you know, but there is a

948
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:08,365
certain amount of it that I have
to learn just to do a good job,

949
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:10,626
you know, and same, I'm sure at
the same as with every single

950
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:13,896
industry that you're in, it's
like, it's just a new, a new

951
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:13,896
puzzle to like, learn about.

952
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,320
Bekah: Well, I think it's
interesting too, because a

953
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,411
lot of early career people or
people who are coming into

954
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:23,791
tech, the thing that you hear
is, well, do you enjoy front

955
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:28,081
end or do you enjoy backend?
Which is really hard to tell

956
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,860
because you've been working on
these very basic understandings

957
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:33,751
of all of the things. And so I
don't think

958
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,835
it gives a really good. Um,
amount of experience,

959
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:43,215
but you might really enjoy
front-end dev in one

960
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:47,896
portion of an industry. Like
maybe you love end dev

961
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:52,606
in healthcare stuff, you hate
front dev in another

962
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:53,255
sector of the industry. And when
I.

963
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:56,436
I've never really thought about
it broken down, but I

964
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:59,016
think like, even going back to
Jessi's podcasts from

965
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:00,755
the beginning of the season
where she talked about that

966
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:05,675
guy who was talking about the
sandwich shop or deli, right.

967
00:45:05,675 --> 00:45:07,206
Like he was interested in the
deli.

968
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:09,846
And so he built something, Jessi
was interested in chess.

969
00:45:09,846 --> 00:45:12,996
And so she framed everything
along those lines.

970
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:18,056
And so in the same way, if. you
feel bored in whatever

971
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:21,655
industry you're working in, but
you like front-end

972
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:24,596
dev or you want to give it a
try, then maybe just

973
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:26,666
try a different industry. And
that might be

974
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,666
more exciting to you.

975
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:34,985
Bryan: For sure. absolutely. I
mean, I think there's

976
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:35,496
a lot of, try to think how to
phrase this.

977
00:45:35,496 --> 00:45:40,460
Like, I feel like. I, I want to
say this

978
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,840
for career changes. This is
probably even

979
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,010
true for just young people,
people in college.

980
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,541
There's a, there's like a lot of
this, I think,

981
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,840
pressure to understand what you
want to do and sort of

982
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:48,195
Bekah: Yeah.

983
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,121
Bryan: into it. And so there's
like this of like

984
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,981
evaluating things like, oh, do I
like front end or like back end?

985
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,481
Do I like machine learning to
like, to.

986
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:02,871
And my, my generalized advice in
my career as it's progressed

987
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:08,661
has always been like, do that.
Just kind of do stuff I know

988
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,661
that sounds so weird, but like,

989
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,090
Bekah: Yes, sir.

990
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,851
Bryan: one of the few industries
where you can do that.

991
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,561
for the first several years of
my career, I

992
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,601
was a front end engineer. Anyone
who's seen things.

993
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:16,431
I created know that that was a
bad decision.

994
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:17,195
Dan: Um,

995
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:18,681
Bryan: front end skills
whatsoever.

996
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:25,221
I can't design anything. And yet
there are three ish

997
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:26,945
websites world that I designed.
God help them.

998
00:46:27,396 --> 00:46:30,516
Uh, you can still find them on
archive.org if you want to.

999
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:35,255
it's like, that's okay. Like I
fiddled in a space.

1000
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:38,465
I even got to get paid for it.
And then I was like, this

1001
00:46:36,815 --> 00:46:41,675
is really not going to work real
for me in the

1002
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:42,365
long-term it should, I should do
something else.

1003
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,945
And I would experiment with data
science.

1004
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:47,646
Uh, I would experiment with
backend projects and

1005
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:50,766
server infrastructure and. Doing
things.

1006
00:46:50,826 --> 00:46:54,186
Uh, it's a big reason why I'm a
big fan of early engineers

1007
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,755
being full stack, just do stuff
like willing to make APIs and

1008
00:46:57,755 --> 00:47:02,076
front end designs and play, you
know, an API development

1009
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:06,815
and database architecture. And,
you know, it's also why

1010
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:08,646
I kind of advocate for young
people, try a start up or

1011
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:09,545
two, because you're going to be
in a space where that

1012
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:09,911
Bekah: Yeah.

1013
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:12,186
Bryan: as a forcing function,
like you're one of five people

1014
00:47:12,186 --> 00:47:14,135
you're going to do everything.
just have to.

1015
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,110
Dan: Yeah, I totally agree with
that.

1016
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,240
And like, I'm glad you said that
because it's.

1017
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,275
It's the kind of advice I've
wanted to give as well.

1018
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:24,315
And I struggled giving it, I
took it like putting it

1019
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:28,666
into, into like phrasing it.
Well, you know, but that like

1020
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:31,635
just stop worrying and just,
just do the thing or whatever,

1021
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:33,646
you know, like, uh, you know,
jump in and, and build.

1022
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:36,436
Bryan: And I mean, I'll also,
I'll even admit, I mean,

1023
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:39,376
just for the sake of devil's
advocate and B can be, you know,

1024
00:47:39,385 --> 00:47:42,315
admitting to the, the risks
there's downsides to that too.

1025
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:46,186
There's not a lot of like, um,
there's not a

1026
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:48,376
lot of good mentorship in tech
either because

1027
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:48,556
Bekah: Yeah.

1028
00:47:48,706 --> 00:47:51,405
Bryan: Like, there's, there's
not a lot of like, um, what's

1029
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:56,835
the word I'm looking for? Um,
There's not a lot of

1030
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:59,085
like apprenticeship paths in
tech where you can,

1031
00:47:56,835 --> 00:48:00,465
like, want to try this. I'm
gonna spend two

1032
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,126
years working with people and
learning.

1033
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,315
It's more like, here's the
thing. Good luck. You know,

1034
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:03,981
Bekah: Yeah.

1035
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:06,735
Bryan: a lot of that in tech and
that can be a negative,

1036
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:09,045
but I, you know, just because of
my nature, I like to spin

1037
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:12,135
that as a positive and be like,
yes, that can be stressful

1038
00:48:12,135 --> 00:48:15,226
and it can have its downsides,
but it also means that.

1039
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:19,485
And have the flexibility to
learn at your pace, to learn on

1040
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:23,655
your own, which is always fun.
And it's rewarding when

1041
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:26,235
you pull things off and it means
that you are never get

1042
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:28,096
yourself stuck in a path. You're
like, crap, I've spent

1043
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:30,496
five years on this thing. I
don't like now, what do I do?

1044
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:33,885
I can't just pivot now. Yeah.
You can just keep moving

1045
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:36,706
until you find things you like
and as an industry

1046
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:36,705
that uniquely affords that
without much downside risk.

1047
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,525
Okay.

1048
00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:45,626
Dan: Yeah, all of that. It, and
it's, it's so true.

1049
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:49,295
And I wanted to call it that
advice of, um, that

1050
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:53,476
you dropped a minute ago. Having
a, when you're early

1051
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:56,056
career like joining a small
team, you know, where you're

1052
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:57,976
going to get that, there's
probably going to be a little

1053
00:48:56,056 --> 00:49:02,626
more pressure on you and maybe a
little less, you know,

1054
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:06,826
structure, uh, to support you,
maybe, you know, but the, but

1055
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:07,996
the, the, the bonuses of it are
so are so large, right?

1056
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:10,726
And then you get the exposure
across like a whole, a whole,

1057
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:13,096
like a large amount of space.
Right.

1058
00:49:13,096 --> 00:49:15,226
And you're going to end up,
like, maybe you're gonna end

1059
00:49:15,226 --> 00:49:18,045
up doing some database work and
also some front end,

1060
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:22,380
you know, react to worker. PHP
or whatever it is, you know,

1061
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:23,550
like whatever they need, right.
Because that's what they need.

1062
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:28,471
And, um, if you, at least, if
you can trust the organization

1063
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:32,521
to be okay with you learning on
the job, you know, then

1064
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:34,081
like that's the best way to,
that's the best way to

1065
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:36,420
get all of the experiences. I
think that's great advice.

1066
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,731
Bryan: And it's sort of like,
there's sort of an interesting

1067
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,860
identity to that that has an
element of risk to it.

1068
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,501
I'll admit like, obviously it
sucks when you fail and

1069
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:46,860
that happens sometimes and I'll
always coach people

1070
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,181
to be like, that's okay. It
really is. I promise, know,

1071
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,990
you used to learn. The same
token by taking the

1072
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:57,451
risk where you might fail those
times where you do get thrown in

1073
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,521
the deep end, thrash around and
learn to swim, feel like heaven.

1074
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,630
It's like, I conquered this.
This is my thing.

1075
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:06,181
Look what I just did. That's
that's a great feeling.

1076
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:07,740
And there's not many places
where you get to

1077
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,960
experience that so often.

1078
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:13,320
Dan: I love that. And yeah, that
is the thing that

1079
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,391
happens all the time in tech.
It, it, you know, it's small

1080
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:19,621
ways in big ways, you know? Even
just squashing that bug

1081
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:22,710
that was driving you crazy for a
hours or whatever, a couple

1082
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,971
of days, you know, that feeling,
uh, vanquishing

1083
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,021
it, you know, it's like such a,
such a good feeling.

1084
00:50:28,021 --> 00:50:31,110
And, uh, you know, that can
scale all the way up to career

1085
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,940
challenges and all that stuff. I
love that.

1086
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:34,141
Bryan: Yup. For sure.

1087
00:50:34,996 --> 00:50:37,306
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
one

1088
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:40,186
of the biggest takeaways that,
that anybody can have

1089
00:50:37,306 --> 00:50:41,806
from what they're doing,
especially early career people.

1090
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:46,096
There's just this, focus on
failure for whatever

1091
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:49,485
reason, you know? Really
flipping it on its head.

1092
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:54,916
It's not a failure. So what is
it like, how else can

1093
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:56,266
you reframe how you're thinking
about this job experience?

1094
00:50:56,266 --> 00:51:00,826
What have you gained from this?
And really like, kind of

1095
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:04,425
addressing like, okay, well, you
know, like maybe it's just,

1096
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:09,016
I learned where my limits are. I
learned that I will not let

1097
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:15,195
treat me like this in a job
situation, it's I learned that

1098
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:20,311
should ask for help sooner. Or,
you know, anything, you

1099
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:23,971
know, I I've, but thinking about
what you've learned in

1100
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:28,050
doing that self evaluation is
not something that we talk

1101
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:33,030
about often, but I think that it
can help combat a lot of

1102
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:37,081
the problems that we see with
early career people who leave

1103
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:38,460
the field, even people who are
interviewing, right, because.

1104
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,565
It's really hard to interview.
If you are interviewing

1105
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:45,846
for junior level position,
there's a lot of people

1106
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:47,255
interviewing for junior level
positions right now.

1107
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:50,585
And to get turned down, it's not
a failure.

1108
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:54,186
about what you've learned, about
how you can take that

1109
00:51:54,186 --> 00:51:58,085
moving forward and, keep using
that, you know, build on that.

1110
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,556
Well, this has been a really
great conversation, Bryan.

1111
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:06,795
Um, but we are just about out of
time.

1112
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:11,626
So is there any last tips that
you have for our listeners,

1113
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:14,235
about career or startup life?

1114
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,610
Bryan: Oh, boy. I mean, that's
dangerous.

1115
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:21,811
I could probably talk forever. I
mean, I guess the last tip

1116
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:22,621
I'll sort of piggyback on
something you were just saying.

1117
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,661
I think it's worth addressing,
I've said it before in different

1118
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:28,320
contexts, but I'll say it again,
which is like, especially

1119
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,445
with things like interviewing.
Remember that that's

1120
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:33,556
its own skill. And, and, and to

1121
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:33,740
Bekah: Yeah.

1122
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:36,525
Bryan: that a little further,
most of the things in this

1123
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:40,726
space are their own skills. And
it's almost a problem that

1124
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:42,076
we'd lump them in with the word
tech it's like saying medicine.

1125
00:52:42,556 --> 00:52:45,436
Like a surgeon is very different
from nurses, very different.

1126
00:52:45,436 --> 00:52:48,226
Like th there's a series of
skills in this space.

1127
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,771
And so to your point, struggling
with any one of those at any one

1128
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:54,951
time, even, you know, getting
better at it than struggling.

1129
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:57,201
Again, none of this really means
anything about you as a

1130
00:52:57,201 --> 00:52:59,510
person doesn't mean anything
about your career path.

1131
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,240
It just it's its own skill that
might need, um, a little

1132
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,300
workout once in awhile, like
interviewing is its own skill.

1133
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:07,670
It's a hard skill. You might get
good at it.

1134
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,260
And then it might go five, six
years before

1135
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,240
you're interviewing again. And
now you're rusty.

1136
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:12,650
Like that's also fine.

1137
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:13,005
Bekah: Yeah.

1138
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,440
Bryan: just always give yourself
grace in this space

1139
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,670
of being like, not failing.
You're just sort of like

1140
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,650
working muscles as you go. And
sometimes those muscles

1141
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,811
take longer to develop. you
develop them and

1142
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:24,740
let them atrophy. That's also
fine.

1143
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,251
You can redevelop them, like
just let yourself grow

1144
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:31,130
at your own pace and just be
willing to, your point.

1145
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,840
Just take lessons from things
that don't work

1146
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,400
out and keep moving.

1147
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:38,146
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. And
for those of you

1148
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:40,096
who don't know, Bryan is very,
very strong as well.

1149
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:44,505
so I'm going to keep going with
this, this analogy here, because

1150
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:46,635
I think like there's some days
you go to the gym, right.

1151
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:48,166
And you can lift that heavy
weight.

1152
00:53:48,465 --> 00:53:50,146
And two days later you go back
there and you

1153
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:53,056
can't lift it, you know, what,
what has happened. Right.

1154
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:53,371
Bryan: yeah.

1155
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:57,065
Bekah: know, A number of
conditions that can happen that

1156
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:59,795
you just can't, you can't hit it
that day, even though it

1157
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:02,795
was easy two days ago, that's
like, it's exactly what you're

1158
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:03,905
saying about interviewing.

1159
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,240
Bryan: Totally. And I mean, I'll
even

1160
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:06,811
extend that further to
something, which I really.

1161
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:11,806
I I've, intense ADHD. So my
focus is all

1162
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:14,695
over the place. There are some
days where

1163
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:17,146
I'm walked in and I'm writing
code and working

1164
00:54:14,925 --> 00:54:17,985
and managing, and everything is
sort of running smooth.

1165
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:20,626
And then I'll have, I'll have
two week long stretches where

1166
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:26,385
I'm just kind of like feel a
little bit, you know, and

1167
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,210
Bekah: the listeners, Bryan,
Bryan is sitting

1168
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,650
there with his hand

1169
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:30,076
Bryan: just

1170
00:54:30,215 --> 00:54:30,485
Dan: Yeah.

1171
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,871
Bekah: in his hand, just living
around.

1172
00:54:31,996 --> 00:54:35,985
Bryan: sort of like looking into
space and it's like, and it's.

1173
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:40,675
I don't know why I have always
been able to all the

1174
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,376
way back to school days I'm
always been able to just

1175
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:47,251
be comfortable with that.
Everyone else I've had

1176
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,130
this very sort of, um, be a
little vulgar for a moment.

1177
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,340
I always, I always joke that I
have a very Boston  f

1178
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,400
you attitude about life. Like
worry about my thing.

1179
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,931
You worry about your thing.
We're all gonna be fine.

1180
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,170
You know? And so I've always
been very comfortable with the

1181
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,150
fact that like, that's, that
happens to me sometimes.

1182
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,411
And it's like, well, the next
two weeks are going to be

1183
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:02,971
some  {stuff} and I'm just going
to drink some coffee

1184
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:06,181
and, and try to muddle through.
But I know a lot of

1185
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:10,260
people struggle with that. And
so like my advice generally,

1186
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:12,481
Try as best you can, whether
that's through your own self

1187
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,851
coaching, whether that's to
outside mentorship or even

1188
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:18,630
therapy or whatever things
needed to get you there to

1189
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:21,570
like, be comfortable with your
own unique way of managing

1190
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:23,990
yourself and your life. Not
everybody is going

1191
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,021
to be in the same boat um, and
that's okay.

1192
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:27,871
And you just sort of like learn
strategies and learn methods

1193
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:29,911
to sort of do your own thing.

1194
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:33,266
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely such
great advice, Bryan, this has

1195
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:37,976
been a great conversation. And
anyone has not met Bryan,

1196
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:42,106
you're missing out because Bryan
always has advice

1197
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:45,646
and hot takes for days. So, very
much have

1198
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:47,496
