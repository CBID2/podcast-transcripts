entrepreneurship. That doesn't

13
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,503
sound right. How do you say that
word? Entrepreneurship,

14
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,698
Bekah: Entre entrepreneurship

00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:52,953

today we're starting off season

29
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,408
four with Jessi Shakarian and,
um, we had a really great

30
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:49,257
conversation with her. Um, Jessi
has had. A really interesting

31
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:52,977
journey. Um, and she does, she
does UX and UI design with, which

32
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,218
is a user experience and user
interface, um, design and

33
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,058
development, and, um, is a really
great conversation. She talks

34
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:04,442
about how, um, she has, she has
different passions. Directly, or

35
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,513
at least originally weren't
directly related to work, but

36
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:09,573
how, if you're passionate about
something and you mix it into

37
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:13,473
your career path, that actually
can be a really know, a really

38
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,643
successful way to,

39
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:18,509
Bekah: cool way to be able to
bring energy to what you're doing

40
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,599
for work, right? Like your work
does not have to be your energy,

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,939
but you can bring energy into
your work. And I thought that was

42
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,199
a really fun way to think about
it because I haven't, I haven't

43
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,050
heard it talked about in that
way.

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,745
Dan: Yeah, exactly. Um, she has a
very unique story and, um, a

45
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:38,104
unique perspective on, on her
career. And I think on, in the

46
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:41,405
dev world in general. So, um, it
was just a really great

47
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:41,764
conversation.

48
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,349
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that the
rest of our episodes will bring

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,560
something for everyone. And we're
very happy to be back for season

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:59,268
four. So thanks for listening. We
start every episode of the

51
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:02,268
podcast. Like we start every
Virtual Coffee. We introduce

52
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:05,298
ourselves with our name, where
we're from, what we do and a

53
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:11,598
random check-in question. Today's
question is what is your favorite

54
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:17,508
magical or mythological animal?
We hope you enjoy this episode.

55
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:23,318
Hi, I'm Bekah. I am a front end
developer from a small town in

56
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:29,138
Ohio. And my favorite magical or
mythological animal is I can't

57
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:33,737
remember anything. I would like
to say unicorn, but I am not

58
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:38,657
convinced that there's no such
thing as unicorns. Um, so Pegasus

59
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,627
is Pegasus a unicorn that flies.
Cause I feel

60
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,943
Dan: I don't think a Pegasus is a
unicorn. I think it's just a

61
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:44,872
horse that flies.

62
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:51,872
Bekah: my favorite mythological
animal is unicorn Pegasus. That's

63
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:52,052
it.

64
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,302
Dan: I'm sure there's a name for
that somewhere. I'm sure somebody

65
00:03:55,302 --> 00:04:00,522
has written a name anyway. Hi,
I'm Dan. I am a front end

66
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:06,312
developer in Cleveland and, um,
Hm. Yeah, I don't have a good

67
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,483
answer for this. I did like, um,
I like the Griffins. Is that, um,

68
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,513
is that the one in Harry Potter
with the it's like a bird with,

69
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:14,647
Bekah: Gryffendor

70
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:15,543
Dan: um,

71
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:16,687
Bekah: isn't it is that who

72
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,658
Dan: No, no, no. Like the birds,
they it's like a lion, you know,

73
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:26,237
body and a bird head and it has
wings. I don't know. I think

74
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:29,057
that's what it is. Uh, you know,
they, they like rescue it, you

75
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,398
know, it's like it like attacks
somebody and all that stuff.

76
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,778
Anyway. Um, I used to play Magic
The Gathering back in the day and

77
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,898
there was, uh, there was a whole,
like, there's a bunch of them in

78
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,802
there. You know, I had likea
whole... I was like them. They're

79
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,713
cool. So that's, that's gonna be
one answer, assuming that I pick

80
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,442
the right name Griffin. I think
that, I think that's it.

81
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:55,098
Jessi: Hi, I'm Jessi. I'm a UX
designer in Los Angeles. And

82
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,757
let's see. Hmm. I feel like I'm
going to go with Pegasus just

83
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,507
because pegasus was always my
favorite. Like, I don't know. I

84
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,267
don't know if you guys remember
the, the Hercules movie, the

85
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,767
Disney one and pegasus was just
the best. I just loved him.

86
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,512
Dan: I actually have not ever
watched it. I tried watching it.

87
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,598
With my kids, because I want to,
you know, like, uh, and they

88
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:20,627
were, Ben was not that interested
in it at the time. So I'm going

89
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:23,117
to give it a shot again. Cause I
was enjoying it. You know, it's

90
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,427
like one of those, you know, you
got four or five-year-old and uh,

91
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,148
it's like, we're here mess with
whether they'll actually pay

92
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:33,288
attention to something that, that
is good. But I'm glad that you

93
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,338
said that's good. Cause I'm not
trying to swing back to that

94
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,298
movie again. I have this whole
list of movies that like, I want

95
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,497
him to watch so that I can watch.

96
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,302
Bekah: It's got a solid
soundtrack. I remember watching

97
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,622
it when I babysat in high school
and I still remember a lot of the

98
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:49,142
soundtrack.

99
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,242
Jessi: It's really. Yeah. And
there's a lot of like, it's, it's

100
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,002
funny for adults too. Cause I
recently rewatched it maybe a

101
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:58,612
year ago and I was like, Oh, this
movie's still hilarious. It's

102
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:01,853
still, there's a reason why it's
still at the top of my, one of my

103
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:03,262
favorites, Disney movies.

104
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:07,148
Dan: awesome. Um, okay. I looked
it up. Uh, it's an Alicorn.

105
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,148
Bekah: Yes, I looked it up too,
or Uni peg or a Pegacorn.

106
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:15,117
Dan: I also unipeg is really
awful. Yeah. That's, that's a

107
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:19,468
really bad one. Um, UniPegasus is
a very unimaginative one. That's

108
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:20,127
showing up here too.

109
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:20,627
Bekah: Yeah,

110
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:24,677
Dan: I think Alicorn is the
right. I think that's, I like

111
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:24,937
that I think

112
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:27,468
Bekah: it needs its own name.
Cause these are really Pegasus is

113
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:31,687
like very good name. It sounds
excellent. But all of these

114
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,077
sound?

115
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:38,762
Dan: Unipeg All right, Unipeg
that's Bekah's favorite animal.

116
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:42,418
Bekah: Yup.

117
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,552
Jessi: You heard it here first,
first?

118
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:46,533
Dan: That's right.

119
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,788
Bekah: Oh, Jessi. Thank you so
much for being here with us

120
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,767
today. Uh, we always love to get
started with your origin story.

121
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:59,387
So where have you been and how
did you get to this point in your

122
00:06:59,387 --> 00:06:59,807
career?

123
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:07,322
Jessi: Um, it's I have a very
non-traditional path into, into

124
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:13,682
tech, um, prior to. The pandemic.
I was going back to school to be

125
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:18,872
a medical lab tech and, and
endemic cabin. And I moved home

126
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:24,093
and I needed to start over. So I
took a career assessment to see

127
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,413
what else I could do. And, um, I
got a 100% match with

128
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,533
programming, which was super
weird. And I was like,

129
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:36,452
programming. Like, I don't know.
Okay. Let's try it because I

130
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:40,697
don't have anything else going
on. So I started teaching myself

131
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:47,747
how to code and, uh, by the end
of 2020, I was freelancing. Um, I

132
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:51,947
just, basically, it was like
HTML, CSS and JavaScript and took

133
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:55,398
some freelancing jobs and pretty
quickly realized that I loved

134
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:58,458
everything that happened before
it was time to code. And So

135
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,148
that's when I sort of switched
gears into, into UX, but I still

136
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:08,177
continue to use all my
development stuff as well. Yeah,

137
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,867
that's kind of how I ended up
here.

138
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,612
Bekah: So Prior to taking that
assessment, what was your

139
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:16,523
experience with tech and
computers?

140
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,298
Jessi: None. All I knew about
tech is that people code like

141
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:25,117
were coders and that was it.

142
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:26,478
Bekah: that's awesome

143
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,942
Dan: So, did your experience
match your, you know, your, uh,

144
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,253
your perspective, your pre coding
perspective?

145
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:37,398
Jessi: It totally blew it away,
honestly, because I was like, oh

146
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:42,317
my God, there's a whole world.
And then I pretty soon realized

147
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:46,697
that like, oh, every company is a
tech company now. So that's

148
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,957
really like a game changer and
it's up to you, what you want to

149
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:54,577
make of it. And I've never seen
an industry like that before.

150
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:58,003
Bekah: That is such a good point.
I love that. And I also came from

151
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:03,373
a very non-technical background.
I was maybe the most technical

152
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:09,403
English teacher. So I taught
people about presentations in

153
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:12,942
integrating technology, into the
classroom and nothing to do with

154
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:17,613
coding. And so it was a, there
there's a real. I think different

155
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:22,263
perspective almost if you don't
have that background, because

156
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:26,643
there's a lot of assumptions in
what people say about technology.

157
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:30,482
Even now that sometimes I have to
ask, like, like, I would love to

158
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,503
know, know what you are talking
about, but I don't have that

159
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,832
experience with that. And so
there's a lot of different

160
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,052
conversations, but good
conversations. I think that

161
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:46,044
happened as a result of that.
Okay, so now you did this pivot

162
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,154
into UX UI. I think it's a pivot,
but maybe you don't. So I'll let

163
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:54,115
you talk about that for a second.
I think that when you first

164
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:58,164
started coming to Virtual Coffee
is when I started to hear you

165
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:02,904
talk more about that. So what got
you interested in that aspect of

166
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:06,875
things and actually, could you
define UX and UI first?

167
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:13,809
Jessi: Uh, sure. So, so UX is
like the organization of the

168
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,975
site. So which pages go, where
and where does the content go?

169
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:23,144
That it makes sense. What's the
research on like, who uses this

170
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:28,304
website? The UI? is more like,
where does the button go? How

171
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:32,024
does, um, particular components
work? Like there's still visual

172
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,975
components in UX, but also like
how those visual components

173
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:40,529
actually work. For the user, I
guess would probably be, um, a

174
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,500
way to describe it actually like
it's one of those things, the UX

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,730
versus UI, like comes up all the
time in like UX circles and it's,

176
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,129
it's very like, it's very
interesting. Um, so yeah, I

177
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,929
actually started in Virtual
Coffee around the holidays last

178
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:03,000
year, and then now I'm still
doing dev stuff and like, You

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,620
know, this community is so great.
And then I started falling out of

180
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,759
love with like JavaScript pretty
quickly. 'Cause I was like, I

181
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,379
don't know about this stuff like
programming, that that career

182
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,690
assessment was wrong basically.
And then spent quite a bit of

183
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,460
time, basically kinda networked
my way into an apprenticeship at

184
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,120
a design agency, like local to me
and. And then, so once I started

185
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,750
kind of getting in the groove
with that, I was like, man, like

186
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,419
I should come back to Virtual
Coffee. Cause it was really fun,

187
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,909
but then it wasn't sure it was
like, but there's so many devs

188
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,960
and not too many like UX people.
So would it still be okay. And

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,440
that's what I kind of started,
like messaging you bekah of like,

190
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,039
can I come back you're like, duh.
Yes.

191
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,190
Bekah: That's not what I said for
the record.

192
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,960
Jessi: Okay. I put, I put an LA
twist on that.

193
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,879
Dan: That's really interesting
though. And that like the

194
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,940
separation between that is, is,
like you said, it's like really

195
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,269
blurry. And even between
development, you know, I would

196
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,860
say that, um, anybody who's
developing is probably is like

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,450
making some UX decisions. So UX
is like user experience. Right.

198
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,539
And, and making some decisions
whether or not, you know, so

199
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,049
depends on the project, I
suppose, uh, what, how much is

200
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,909
dictated right to the developer.
Um, but even at the lowest level,

201
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,129
you're, you're still affecting,
you know, somebody's going to use

202
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,370
the thing that you're making.
Right. Um, and so when you're

203
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,870
coding, you know, you have, uh,
an idea of what the experience is

204
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,750
going to be for the user and what
the interface, right. So UI is

205
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,820
user interface or what the
interface is going to look like.

206
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,169
And, um, last times when you're
coding, then you get stuck into,

207
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,315
okay, I know what I want this
thing to do. You know, and it's

208
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,524
like, then it, you know, it can
be hard to actually get it to do

209
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:03,945
it or whatever that is the part
maybe that you I'm putting words

210
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,375
in your mouth, but like that you
didn't enjoy as much, but like

211
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,534
actually laying out the
experience for a user and like

212
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,205
how things should happen and you
know, what, what people should

213
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:15,855
see, stuff like that is what you,
uh, were more interested in. Is

214
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:16,154
that right?

215
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,004
Jessi: I guess it was more like,
um, okay, so. So, like I had a

216
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,865
freelance project where I worked
like end to end. And so I, I, I,

217
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:31,004
in my twenties I wrote a lot. So
I, I spent, I spent upselled a

218
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:33,764
little bit and was like, oh, we
can write some copies, you know,

219
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:37,004
do some content strategy work.
And so we started from beginning

220
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:43,095
to end and, um, it was more like,
oh, like, how do I, I don't

221
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:46,585
understand a website, right? Or
an app or whatever. And how do,

222
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,820
how do i cat-- almost categorize
and it gets very like nerdy,

223
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,090
right? Like, you know, what is
the hierarchy? Like? What's the

224
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,899
most important thing. What's less
of a priority. Um, and things

225
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,779
like that. And that helps me sort
of understand the whole picture.

226
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,870
And that's when I was like, oh,
this is really interesting. And

227
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,159
so I thought that I was like,
yeah, okay. Like UX all in. And

228
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,605
then I was like, but. Yeah.
right. Like you talked about

229
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:16,154
like, it's like, it's like an
onion and the layers of like,

230
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,304
okay, there's UX, but then you go
deeper than that and the UX needs

231
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:24,044
to be coded, but then the visual
design needs to play a part just

232
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:30,674
as important. And is the, is the
context, correct? Like in your,

233
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:35,565
in your content strategy, like
there's so many components that I

234
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:40,710
feel like I never left coding in
some ways, because I'm always

235
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,759
still thinking about it. How
does, how do you implement a

236
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,440
design change on a, on a coding
level, right? Can you implement

237
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,100
that, you know, legacy code and
all sorts of things, you know, if

238
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,169
you don't have the source code
than what you know. And so the

239
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,429
skills I learned as a coder still
helped me in my work today

240
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:07,950
because. I'm now have a more
holistic approach to design. Like

241
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,149
if I, I can see if, if, if a
client said, oh, I really like

242
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,840
this on a website, but I can tell
like, oh, is that JavaScript? Or,

243
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,659
oh, I think that might be React.
And so research that, you know,

244
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,940
and so it still provides so much,
so much value and the skills that

245
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,320
I learned, the analytical skills
problem-solving skills and on a

246
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,320
coding level, like I've never.
anything quite like that before,

247
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,850
if that makes sense, like, it's
been invaluable.

248
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,365
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. I can
see how that, uh, the experience

249
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:45,514
would be really helpful. Maybe
even crucial to somebody who's

250
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:49,595
going to be, um, making high
level UX decisions, you know, uh,

251
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,595
for, especially for websites and
stuff, because like you said,

252
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:55,085
there's, there's so many things
that go into all of those

253
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,534
decisions, you know, and if you
only have one piece of the puzzle

254
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:02,159
in your mind, Well, you'll be
limited, I suppose. Uh, you know,

255
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,370
about the decisions you can make
and things like that. I think

256
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,789
that's really cool. Um, can you
talk, you said you, you got an

257
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:13,620
apprenticeship, um, with a studio
and could you talk a little bit

258
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,659
about that experience? Um, now
I'm asking more like from not

259
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,179
coding or not the like UX, like
what you're actually doing, but

260
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,580
like how the, how did the
apprenticeship like thing work?

261
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,590
Because I haven't talked to very
many people. Who've actually gone

262
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,710
through a formal apprenticeship
and I'm very interested. about

263
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,029
that, just kind of talk about.

264
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:35,644
Jessi: Yeah. So are you, um,
there's a local, I have a local

265
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:41,524
UX group and, um, so one of the
people who run that UX group, um,

266
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:46,894
they have a design agency. And
so, um, I sort of networked my

267
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:51,125
way into that local group of, of,
I was looking for a UX job and

268
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:55,625
there was a recruiter and he was
like, oh, Hey, you live in our

269
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:00,195
area. You should join our group.
And I was like, oh cool. I had no

270
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:04,424
idea. There was a us group here.
And so, you know, as I was

271
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,894
hanging out on that group, you
know, it was like on discord. And

272
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,775
I was looking up, you know, on
LinkedIn trying to find some

273
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:16,125
stuff about like, who does these
different parts of UX? And I

274
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,704
ended up seeing one of the people
in our group, but I was like, oh

275
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,154
my God, Hey, that's that's her.
And so I messaged her and was

276
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,875
like, Hey, you know, I, I saw
that you do some UX stuff. Like

277
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,174
that's really interesting. And so
she was like, Hey, you know, I,

278
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:34,305
I, I run the design agency and we
have this apprenticeship program.

279
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:39,674
Um, and so why don't you fill out
an application? Um, then I got in

280
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:44,744
and, um, yeah, so I did about six
months of apprenticeship where we

281
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:50,009
worked on different projects. So
some were personal projects. For

282
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,410
anybody who doesn't know, like
I'm now obsessed with chess

283
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,430
because of Queen's Gambit. And so
that was one project. And then I

284
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,740
had some other things like the
information architecture

285
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,119
conference, which I worked on,
um, last year and now I'm back on

286
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,579
this year. And so I learned, uh,
I gained a lot of skills by being

287
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,789
an apprentice and working on
these projects and, and sort of

288
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:15,809
getting like a, a hand, like a
more real world experience about

289
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,869
how to do UX. Sort of brought in
like my coding experience because

290
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:26,009
my boss is not a coder, so she'd
be like, oh, so wait, what do you

291
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,569
think about ghost? You know, and
I, I want to move all my stuff to

292
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:31,140
ghost see that. So then we talk
about that and then, you know,

293
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,690
so, so yeah, and then my
apprenticeship was six months. So

294
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,369
this was January when I started.
And then by June I was done like

295
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,839
officially, like, you know,
promoted to a UX designer. And

296
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,309
then by July, uh, we got a
contract. That was just a good

297
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:52,440
fit for me. So, um, I started
that and that was more about like

298
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,500
incorporating some machine
learning aspects and I had

299
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,930
already been learning Python. Um,
and so, yeah, that's basically

300
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,690
been, been my, my journey, of my
apprenticeship. And now I have

301
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,059
two about to be two practices of
my own as, as they are starting.

302
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,170
Um, there are journeys into UX,
so that's true.

303
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:21,055
Dan: that's very cool. Yeah. Um,

304
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,500
Bekah: that was kind of what you
needed because it sounds like

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,160
before, when you were doing web
dev kind of stuff, it was, it

306
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,930
wasn't a good fit. And then that
changed seems like it was what

307
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,619
you needed to kind of, you know,
get you excited about what you

308
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:36,799
were doing.

309
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,825
Jessi: Yeah. You know, that's the
funny thing is the chess stuff is

310
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:47,400
what brought me back to coding
because like they, the. Chess

311
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,119
engines and like the bots and
things they're, they're very good

312
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,509
at particular things, but there's
a lot of like usability things

313
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,839
that I really have a problem
with. And so I was like, okay,

314
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:01,019
I'm going to learn to code again,
specifically to deal with this.

315
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,220
And I need to use Python and, you
know, some understand some

316
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,660
components of machine learning to
do that. And so that was. I was

317
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,289
really nervous about it, but, um,
it ended up being really fun. And

318
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,559
partly because I already had the
experience of Java, so maybe

319
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,130
jumped ship. Wasn't my bag, like
my best choice of their first

320
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,539
language, but it helps so much
learning Python because I already

321
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,849
had the, like those fundamental
skills. And so. That was really

322
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,740
great because I was like, oh,
this coding is really fun. So it

323
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,579
became like another piece. Right.
And then I'm like, okay, so we

324
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,589
got the UX stuff. We were doing
coding somewhere, coding stuff,

325
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,500
like, okay, cool. So I can kind
of sit with this and this feels

326
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,289
good. Right. It's just, it's just
about like, what's the language

327
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,809
that's going to click with you.
And that is something that I did

328
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,960
not understand when I first
started. Cause I, I really did

329
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,900
did not like JavaScript. It was,
it was just stress me out so

330
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,875
much. But I'll turn it around
back in Python. I'm like, oh,

331
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,384
cool. It was awesome. Should have
chosen Python first.

332
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:06,470
Bekah: I think that investment
that comes from when you're

333
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,759
solving a problem, that you care
about goes a really long way. And

334
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,480
to allow me to become interested
in what you're working on. I

335
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,240
mean, for sure you could do
projects that you're not

336
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,660
interested in the con in the
content or, or what you're

337
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,529
working with, but I find like, it
gets really exciting when you're

338
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,880
like, I love this thing and I
know I can make it better, right?

339
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,865
Jessi: And it also becomes like,
I know I can make it better, but

340
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:37,454
also no one else is going to make
it better. At least in the way

341
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:40,755
that, you know, you will. So then
it'd be kind of becomes like, I

342
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:43,875
kind of have to do this. And
that's what it felt like. I was

343
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,444
like, okay, these chess engines
have some usability components

344
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:50,144
that I really, really don't like.
And they're clearly made by

345
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:55,529
programmers, like for. Um, chess
players who play a lot and I'm a

346
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,859
beginner. So this isn't really
like beginner oriented. And that

347
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,509
was my sort of initial quandary,
right. Of like, okay, I have to,

348
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:06,390
how do I fix this? Okay. I got to
start, go back and learn Python.

349
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,589
Okay. But Yeah, that, that really
helps, like knowing you have

350
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:13,440
something passionate about that
you'd want to spend a hundred

351
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,490
hours or whatever, working on it.
Like it makes a big difference.

352
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,595
When I started, I didn't know.
Cause I was just kind of feeling

353
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:23,654
around in the dirt going okay.
Where do I start? A web dev.

354
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:24,944
Okay. Let's start there. Okay.

355
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:31,259
Dan: Yeah, I think, I think the.
You know, there, there's, there's

356
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,880
a bunch of different pieces
obviously to, to learning, uh,

357
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,180
especially when you're learning
on your own like this and, you

358
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,549
know, finding a language that
you're comfortable in is part of

359
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:43,214
it, for sure. But I imagine...
what I've experienced myself and

360
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,285
notice through other people, as,
you know, having a project that

361
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,894
you care about, like you're like
you guys were just saying, um,

362
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:51,585
goes such a long way, right?
Because, because then it doesn't

363
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:54,555
matter if like, it doesn't matter
as much if the syntax is weird in

364
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:57,964
whatever language you're using or
whatever, because if you, you,

365
00:22:57,964 --> 00:23:01,575
you, you know, if you're excited
about the project, then it's just

366
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:05,085
like smooth everything out so
much. But for me, at least, um,

367
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:10,799
it seems like maybe for you to,
um, the, the, like, I dunno, just

368
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,039
the being in there, you know,
like who cares, how many hours

369
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,559
you're doing on it. You know what
I mean? Like that sort of feeling

370
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,140
when you get in that groove, it's
really cool. It's very exciting.

371
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:22,984
Jessi: Yeah, no, it is. And
there's something really kind of

372
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:27,424
fun about like, okay. So
everybody, like in, in the UX

373
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:31,144
world pretty much knows me as
like the chess lady. And so

374
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:34,204
there's something really fun
about like how people know me

375
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,355
that way. And I'm like, okay, so
personal branding check done.

376
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:42,875
Right. But also that it becomes
like, well, if people get hooked

377
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,960
on. You can't, you can't fake
passion. Right. And that's,

378
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,130
that's a driving force because
things need to get done. And if

379
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,890
you're passionate about it, then
it will go a long way and

380
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,609
everybody will notice it. And the
other people who are I've found

381
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:00,390
her, like, I don't know anything
about chess, but like, it's

382
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,029
really cool watching this
journey. Right. And that just

383
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:05,789
becomes really, really fun. And
I'm like, oh, okay. So it's

384
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,980
motivating, right? I'm not, I'm
not, um, I'm not being boring or

385
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,319
whatever, you know what I mean?
Like, like, I guess it's social

386
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,119
media, you know, if you don't
want to follow somebody, you

387
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,269
don't have to, but at the same
time who, who it brings to you

388
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,839
who gravitates to you? That also
becomes really interesting

389
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,799
because it's people I probably
never would have thought to talk

390
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,279
to or anything like that. If that
makes sense.

391
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,744
Dan: Absolutely. And it's, it's
one of those things too, where

392
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:38,234
since it's very clearly a, an
organic thing for you, you know,

393
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:41,025
um, everybody can tell that, you
know, you can, everybody can tell

394
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:44,505
you're, you're passionate as
well, but it's. You mentioned

395
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:47,714
personal branding and that's
always, you know, uh, can be a

396
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:52,575
weird place to be, but like the,
um, I think leaning into

397
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,125
something you're passionate
about, like, this is it's, it's

398
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:59,835
always a smart move, you know?
And it's, I don't know, I kinda

399
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:04,170
lost my point. I was going to say
something about, um, He, you can

400
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,079
tell when somebody wants to like,
wants to make a personal brand,

401
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,650
but they don't have a thing like
that, you know, and therefore

402
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,170
forcing it or whatever. Um, yeah.
Right. And, um, I don't know.

403
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,779
It's, it's, it's cool. And, and I
think this is good advice for

404
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,269
some, for other people, you know,
it's finding something like that

405
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:26,579
and, and finding ways to use it,
to learn more or to spread your,

406
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,069
you know, spread your networking
or all of that stuff, all the

407
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,289
stuff that you've been doing.
It's very cool. And like chess

408
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,015
has. Well, it just got, I don't
know, popular, not popular is not

409
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,055
the right word, but like, it just
got some press, chess just got

410
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:40,454
some press right. With the, uh,
Queens gambit, you know, so I was

411
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:43,065
like, people are kind of like
More back into it again, you

412
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:45,644
know, um, which is, which is
always interesting to see too.

413
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,894
Um, so I dunno. It's, it's very
cool.

414
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,414
Jessi: Yeah. And I will say that
I remember talking to a hiring

415
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:55,884
manager who said that he, they
hired some developers who made a

416
00:25:55,884 --> 00:26:00,325
website about sandwiches. You
know what I mean? Like okay.

417
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:04,680
Like, That dude just loved
sandwiches, but it worked because

418
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,819
it showed on his, you know, on
his portfolio. And so it's like,

419
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:12,390
that's why I loved it. Like, like
before I started playing chess, I

420
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,819
thought it was boring. And you
had to be like really smart to

421
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,430
understand it. And I was just
like, oh, I'm not that

422
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,109
intelligent to do it. But really
it's just about knowing what

423
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,690
you're yeah like, what your
passion is, but like, how do you

424
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,200
use that for your strengths and
your weaknesses? to show others,

425
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,480
to show hiring managers, what you
can do. It's just, it's just a

426
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,630
vessel, right? It's and it should
be the thing that you really

427
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,049
love.

428
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:40,785
Bekah: I think it's such great
advice too, because we hear a lot

429
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:46,095
of people say like, you have to
be excited about tech. Uh, and I

430
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:50,204
think that you can be excited
about tech, but you can be

431
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:54,390
excited about something else, and
use tech to showcase that thing.

432
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
And I think that that can be a
really great approach because

433
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,240
you're right. Like when you're
excited about something and other

434
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,539
people get excited around you, I
don't know. It just creates this

435
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,039
like amazing energy. And I just
love that feeling of a really

436
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,914
enjoyed this. And now. Full Bekah
comes out like in those

437
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:17,505
situations where I can be excited
and passionate about something,

438
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:21,944
we all talk about it together.
And this like very unique way

439
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:28,065
that doesn't happen when you're
kind of feeling out the industry

440
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:32,625
or the conversation or the group.
You can kind of let that go a

441
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:36,365
little bit and just be excited
and allow everyone to be excited.

442
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:41,954
In the conversation with you. And
that just feels great. It feels

443
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:47,954
productive, but it feels deep and
deeper than things that I think

444
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:52,934
we normally feel when we stick to
things that, that, you know,

445
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:58,424
maybe we don't really get excited
about, or we feel like, well, we

446
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:01,964
should be excited about this. So
this is what we should talk

447
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:06,055
about. You know, talk about what
you want to talk about. And

448
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:10,075
that's how you find that like
really fun space.

449
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,410
Jessi: Yeah, Yeah. I think I
totally agree. Right? That's not

450
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,960
about chasing the trends because
the trends come and go. And to

451
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,950
me, it was, it was the
realization that like tech is so

452
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,940
big. And so if you make it what
you want, then you create the

453
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,329
space that you wish you want to
see. And other people will be

454
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,670
pretty happy if, you know,
there's always at least one

455
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,460
person who was like, oh, Hey,
you, you have just carved out the

456
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,599
space of like building your own,
like Magic, The Gathering

457
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,359
database or cool. You know what,
I didn't like that this other

458
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,424
database doesn't have X, Y, and
Z. Right. So it just. It's it's

459
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:54,065
it's so framed. Right? You don't
have to fit into any particular

460
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:57,484
component. Like yeah. You could
chase chase the cloud book for

461
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:02,345
awhile. Like that's, that's a
very superficial, um, and

462
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:05,974
there's, it's definitely not
about like, that's like the tech

463
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,994
definitely comes second rather
than first. Right? It's about

464
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:13,325
making the thing that you want to
see, and that, that could be the

465
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:18,589
software. Which is great, but it
could also be something else that

466
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,500
everybody, any other, any like
non-tech people can use too.

467
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,240
Dan: Yeah, I love that. And like,
even just further on this point,

468
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,839
like, if you are super into
something you don't have to, and

469
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,220
you were kind of saying this too,
but you don't have to make like

470
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,569
the business decisions, you know,
like it doesn't have to be some

471
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,730
successful product that you're
going to sell or something, you

472
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,359
know, uh, necessarily right. The
like sandwich website, probably

473
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,339
isn't making a ton of money, but,
but you know, the guy was into it

474
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:50,609
and like had some fun and you
know, was able to learn some

475
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:52,920
stuff and probably helped him get
a job and all that stuff, you

476
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,589
know, it's it's, I don't know.
It's cool. I, I do feel that

477
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:58,680
sometimes people lean too hard
on. What am I getting out of

478
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,410
this? Or, or what am I like, what
can I turn this into? Like you

479
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,200
said, like the cloud or any, any
of the profit or any of that

480
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,460
stuff, you know? And when it's,
when it's something you are just,

481
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,190
when you, when it's something you
just care about, like that it's,

482
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,880
um, I don't know. The learning
just comes naturally. I feel like

483
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,529
the benefits come, come out of,
out of that space.

484
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,329
Jessi: Think, oh, sorry.

485
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,890
Dan: No, I was done.

486
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,289
Jessi: Um, I was actually just
kind of thinking about how, like,

487
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,670
you know, and there's a lot of
people coming out of bootcamps

488
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,170
and hiring managers start to see
the same projects over and over.

489
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,460
Right. So it's always like the
todo app and, uh, astrology app

490
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,849
and the, you know, tic-tac-toe
like, so. How do you stand out.

491
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,039
Right. And you have to be honest
with yourself. Like what's

492
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,970
something that I want to put in
the timeline and, and, you know,

493
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,289
be able to talk about with every
hire, every interview, you know,

494
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,069
and it should be something that
shows that, that excitement, like

495
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,150
it's great to have made a
tic-tac-toe app or a, to do app,

496
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,079
but at the same time, like what's
a problem that we want to solve.

497
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,115
That's going to help you stand
out, especially for. When you're

498
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:11,055
just trying to get your foot in
the door. Right. And you have to,

499
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:18,164
to really be memorable, but you
have to just be yourself and you

500
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:21,404
have to show that, you know, and
that's, that can be hard for

501
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:21,825
people.

502
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:27,105
Bekah: I think that's such great
advice in, I think that. That's

503
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:30,434
that's something that you just
really have to recognize and work

504
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,194
on. Like it's okay to be
different than other people. And

505
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:36,644
I think even traditional
schooling really pushes towards

506
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,394
the sanitisation of who you are.
Right. And like, well, what are

507
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:43,484
your achievements? Right. And so
for a lot of us, it's just

508
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:47,085
ingrained in our mindset that the
achievements are who we are. But

509
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:50,865
that's not, it it's about, you
know, the things that we enjoy,

510
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:54,734
the things that we are passionate
about and being able to share

511
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,525
those things. And, you know,
sometimes it requires

512
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:01,484
vulnerability and sometimes it
can be scary because you know,

513
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,855
other people are out there and
they're like, I, I built this

514
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,765
great thing. And then, and then
you play that comparison game.

515
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:11,835
Like, well, I did, I as my thing
as good as that, but I think that

516
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:18,375
you're always winning if you are
working towards something that

517
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:23,055
you enjoy doing or that you're
passionate about, and it doesn't

518
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:26,519
have to be tech related. I was
talking with a couple of members

519
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,900
in the coworking room yesterday.
W what, what, how would we like

520
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,960
new members to introduce
themselves? Right? Like what,

521
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,480
when they introduced themselves
in the welcome channel, what

522
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,839
should we ask them? And what
everybody said was what's

523
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,734
something outside of tech that
you enjoy, right. Those are the

524
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:46,625
fun connections that you make.
And I think it was Kirk. And he

525
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,805
was like, well, you know, I saw
somebody said they like fishing

526
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:51,325
and then somebody else responded
about the fishing. And now

527
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:54,835
they're talking like all of this
cool and fun stuff. And you know,

528
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:59,394
if somebody came in, actually I
could probably tell you all of

529
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,805
the people who said, I like
weightlifting, like, yes, me too.

530
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:08,005
Right. But if, if you asked me to
name all of the front end

531
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:11,664
developers, I couldn't definitely
couldn't do that. You know?

532
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,825
Jessi: Yeah. Yeah, no. 'Cause
we're people, right. We have

533
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:24,464
multifaceted, you know, interests
and, and that's what makes us

534
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:28,755
unique. And so why shouldn't we
show that this is how I am

535
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:34,065
different, right. But for, for
good, not in like a, not in a bad

536
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:37,115
way or anything like that. You
know? being different is good.

537
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,569
Bekah: Right. And I think that if
you find companies too, Enjoy

538
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:45,869
that, or if they mentioned that,
and that's a good indication,

539
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:49,440
like, look, this person is
interested in more than just my

540
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,630
tech stack. They're interested in
the person in front of them and

541
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,670
that's a really good place to
start.

542
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,470
Jessi: Absolutely.

543
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:03,855
Dan: I was man. I had something
to say before and now it's

544
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:09,929
totally gone. It was about, yeah,
it was a total different topic.

545
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,829
So if we, uh, I didn't want to,
that's why, you know, it was

546
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:15,105
Bekah: Go for it.

547
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,380
Dan: all right. What I was going
to ask was, oh, kind of going

548
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,070
back to circling all the way back
to sort of toward the beginning

549
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,070
of the conversation, but w we
were talking about, um, you're

550
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,469
working and what you're doing
now, and so are you, you're on

551
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,460
your own freelance now?

552
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,050
Jessi: Um, so I'm doing, uh,
wrapping up a, uh, contract

553
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,599
project for our agency, but, um,
Yeah, so generally I'm, I'm

554
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,239
pretty much freelancing
otherwise.

555
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,704
Dan: Yeah, this is what made me,
this is how it got here. It was

556
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:50,039
was, we were talking about.
That's being yourself and, you

557
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,260
know, companies hiring you and
stuff like that. And I've been,

558
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,900
I've been independent, you know,
for my entire career. So it's

559
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,679
like, one of the benefits of, of
that is, um, for me, is being

560
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,530
able to be myself a lot more, you
know? And I was wondering if

561
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,429
that, if that like, had enter in
your, your thought process about,

562
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,400
um, instead of, you know, like
doing contract work and stuff

563
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,869
like that, as opposed to trying
to get hired or excuse me,um

564
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,519
maybe, you're trying to get
hired. I'm not, I'm not sure, but

565
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,730
like, if you've decided to stay
on the contracting route, you

566
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,000
know, um, whether any of that
sort of thought went into your

567
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,389
went into your decision making
process.

568
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,534
Jessi: Yeah, it did. I mean, um,
I mean, I'm interested in, in

569
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:33,315
contract work. I, I'm still kind
of, I think I'll be almost a full

570
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:37,394
year of contracting or general
freelancing. So, um, this has

571
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:40,784
been a really different
experiences from going from like,

572
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:45,735
pre-tech like just having like a
regular stable job. Um, and I

573
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:50,474
think some part of it is like the
freedom of contract work and I

574
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:55,275
can pick and choose what jobs um,
I'm excited about. And that

575
00:35:55,284 --> 00:36:00,420
that's really freeing, even
though it's more. Puts you more

576
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,349
in free fall if a job ends too
early or they don't pick you up

577
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:08,639
for the next round and things
like that. But I do find it more

578
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,139
rewarding to be able to pick what
I want to work on. Um, and that,

579
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,670
that I think is also a part of it
of just accepting that this is

580
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,599
who I am. And I kind of have a
bit of an entrepreneurial bug in

581
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,559
like, kind of just have to accept
that because, you know, I don't

582
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,894
know how, how much like.
Full-time like, uh, you know,

583
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:36,255
regular stable job would fit my,
my, uh, like personality, I

584
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:40,695
guess. Um, and that, that becomes
really fun when people are like,

585
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:43,994
oh, Hey, you know, I have this
thing. And I think he'd be really

586
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,574
perfect to like, work on this.
And then it's like, yeah. Okay.

587
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,514
Like you thought I would be a
good fit, you know, instead of

588
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:53,655
having to me having to. you know,
argue for why I think I would be

589
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:58,690
a good fit in a company
elsewhere. Um, you know, so that,

590
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,039
that really becomes really
energizing because I'm now

591
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:08,519
accepting myself for my strengths
and weaknesses career-wise um,

592
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,849
then that was something I always
felt like I had to find a stable

593
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,929
job and just do the nine to five
kind of grind, but also just

594
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,300
accepting that, like, maybe
that's not the right fit for me

595
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,440
because it's, it's quite taxing
and, you know, things like that.

596
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,400
So. It's much more fun to be
working in like quote-unquote

597
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,360
sprinting times of contract work,
if you break contract work, but,

598
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:34,349
you know, we, I like to dig deep,
so that works really well for me.

599
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,579
Um, and so, yeah, that's, I think
it's really exciting to be like,

600
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,010
you know what, this is much
better for me. It's not

601
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:48,059
necessarily the status quo and
it's not quite as, um, you know,

602
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,454
what's the word I'm looking
for... Like it's not as. It's not

603
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:54,505
in the norm. You know what I

604
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,650
Dan: I was going to say normal.

605
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,414
Jessi: it's not the norm, but
it's, it's okay to accept that

606
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:04,135
that's not just not gonna work as
well. That might change. And

607
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:07,375
that's the thing, right. I might
say right now, this isn't it. But

608
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,195
six months from now, I might be
like, uh, you know what, I'm

609
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:12,715
tired of writing all those
proposals and then getting

610
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:16,554
rejected or not hearing from them
for three months or whatever, you

611
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:19,969
know, I just want to clock in,
clock out. Or a year from now,

612
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,260
five years from now, whatever. So
that's also okay too. And then

613
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,360
maybe one day you want to come
back to freelancing

614
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,210
Bekah: That's a good that's such
mindset.

615
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,380
Jessi: It's always about like,
having things open. Right. And

616
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,219
just seeing where things go.
That's always kind of been the

617
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,429
thing with tech for me is like,
okay, I'll just see what happens.

618
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,289
100% massive programming, I guess
I'll try it. What's the worst

619
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,300
that can happen. Right. I don't
like it.

620
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,619
Dan: I love that. I love the, I
love the way you said all of

621
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,250
that. Um, it, it lines up a lot
with the way that I fell too. Um,

622
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,469
and I just, I just appreciated
that the, um, uh, man, my brain

623
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:07,900
is fried today. The, uh, yeah,
the, the freedom and the like

624
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:11,349
the, the ability to be more
individual I think is, is one of

625
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,780
those things. I've suggested
freelancing to people before. And

626
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,449
they've like laughed at me or
scoffed at me or whatever, not

627
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:21,659
laughed at me, but you know, like
laughed at the idea. And, um,

628
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,469
it's nice to hear, to hear
somebody like you that has been

629
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,960
successful and enjoys it. And,
you know, has the like, sort of

630
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,489
open-mindedness about it as well.
You know, it's, it seems like a

631
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:35,670
healthy, a healthy mindset about
the whole thing, um, too.

632
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:40,545
Bekah: I, um, I, as soon as they,
when I was in bootcamp before I

633
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,565
was. Um, maybe like in my last
three months, so it took me about

634
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:49,545
a year. I went to this talk with
a founder of an organization and

635
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:52,485
I said, you know, I think I would
really like to freelance. I'm a

636
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:57,195
mom. I like the flexible schedule
and, you know, to, to not be

637
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:01,094
working 40 hours a week. And his
response to me was don't sell

638
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:05,625
yourself short and I'm like, Hmm.
I don't know that that's

639
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,655
accurate. Like, I don't think I'm
selling myself short. I didn't

640
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:12,795
say that. I thought that I
couldn't do the work. I said,

641
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:16,155
this is what I'm looking for. And
there were so many people who

642
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:21,344
said you won't be able to find a
job coming out of bootcamp as it

643
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:28,619
as a freelancer and I did. You
know, very quickly. And so it is,

644
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,679
I mean, a lot of it's about
putting yourself out there, but

645
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,039
it's been for me a great
experience. And Jessi one of the

646
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,179
things that you said about, I'm
trying to think of the exact

647
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:43,170
words, but I can't, I can't right
now, something about, you know, I

648
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,739
think you would be great for this
position. Right? And so I've

649
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,590
interviewed for full-time work
and I've interviewed, or had

650
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,500
conversations for contract work.
And like one of the things I like

651
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,204
about contract. So far, most of
them have started because of

652
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,614
conversations. It's not been this
huge interview process where I

653
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:04,844
feel like I need to prove myself,
like you were saying of do, do

654
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:08,684
you think that I'm good enough
No, like there's already an

655
00:41:08,684 --> 00:41:11,324
established understanding and
it's come through networking that

656
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:15,344
like, this would be a good fit.
Now let's continue this

657
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:20,025
conversation. Right. And that's
been. Huge. And, and one of the

658
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:25,125
reasons why I continue to prefer
that work because the anxiety

659
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:29,655
that comes with not only the
interview process, but all of

660
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:34,110
the. All the stuff that doesn't
make sense to me, I get like

661
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,230
super frustrated, like, why are
we even doing this? Like, there's

662
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,429
not a point in, in doing this
portion of the interview or doing

663
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,449
this portion of the application.
And that inefficiency just for

664
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,690
me, sends off like these red
flags in my brain where my brain

665
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,050
is like, Nope, not going to do
this. You know? And so it was

666
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:57,300
nice to just be able to work
together with people who are

667
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,860
focused on. I'm doing that, like
working together and enjoying

668
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,099
each other presence, you know?

669
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,150
Jessi: Yeah, no, I absolutely
agree. I think that the

670
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,949
interesting thing about, um, like
the contract job I'm on right now

671
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,139
has been the, the internal team
they've asked, how can we help

672
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:24,135
you? And it's just like, Wow.
That's the first time I think

673
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,534
I've ever heard that, but that
doesn't mean that doesn't mean

674
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:30,224
that people don't do it, but in
terms of like, I've, you know,

675
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:33,164
done freelance work with other
freelancers, and then we just

676
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:36,045
kind of worked together, but to
have the, to have an internal

677
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:39,224
team be like, Hey, we want to
help you because you're helping

678
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:43,704
us. And, and that was really cool
and really welcoming rather than.

679
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,445
I guess the stress of being like
the new person to the team and

680
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,085
being like, oh my God, I have to
catch up and do all this stuff.

681
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:53,025
But no, I worked, I was
completely separately from the

682
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:56,204
internal team and I just do my
thing and they just do their

683
00:42:56,204 --> 00:43:00,585
thing and we would come together
when we need to, and we help each

684
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:04,594
other, but then we still work
separately. So that's the

685
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:08,684
freedom, right? It's like, you
know, I might not know

686
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:12,659
everything. What they've done or
like what they're working on as I

687
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:18,360
continue to work. But at the same
time, like there's a, it's like a

688
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,030
different kind of camaraderie, I
guess, even though it's short

689
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,269
term.

690
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:23,693
Dan: Yeah, that's really cool
that that's, that's always an

691
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:26,932
interesting interface as well as
the freelance, especially with,

692
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:32,123
with, um, Uh, a company that has
developers, you know, um, so lots

693
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,463
of times if you freelance,
freelance, just to somebody who

694
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:37,853
needs something, but doesn't have
any capability, you know? Um, and

695
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:41,753
then other times it's like you're
doing now, you're helping out a

696
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:45,563
team that has developers, you
know, and th that's, uh, in my

697
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:48,757
experience has been an
interesting. Sort of thing to see

698
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:52,507
how it, how it all works, you
know? Um, so I mean, it sounds

699
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:55,027
like you're in a really good
spot, a really good position. Um,

700
00:43:55,088 --> 00:43:57,487
as far as communication and
contracting and stuff, uh, with

701
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:01,268
your current contract, um, that's
really cool. Have you had any

702
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:06,038
other, I mean, you don't need to
say any like any bad experiences,

703
00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:09,907
but like has like, has that been
the norm I suppose is my

704
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:13,268
question, um, you know, with when
you're, when you're dealing with

705
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:18,217
other teams, um, or has it been
any other interesting situations

706
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,538
that have come up? Um,

707
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:22,617
Jessi: Um, no, I mean, mostly
this is actually my first, like

708
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:26,318
really big, like, uh, Um, you
know, enterprise tech company.

709
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:30,068
So, um, everything I've done
prior has been like really small,

710
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:34,237
like small-time clients and, or
like, uh, subcontracting work for

711
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:39,157
other freelancers and just my
freelance network, um, and things

712
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:41,887
like that. So that's why I was
like, oh, this is really cool. We

713
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:46,672
get to come in, we get to help
people out. Um, and then. If they

714
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:50,422
want to keep working with us.
That's great. If not, then that's

715
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:54,052
okay. There's always other stuff
to do. Um, and that was just

716
00:44:54,052 --> 00:45:00,802
kinda, kind of nice to see that
you can get like a peek into a

717
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:04,762
team and see, do I like them? Do
I not like them? Do I like this

718
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:08,572
company? Is that something I want
to keep working on? Is that a

719
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,782
company that I might want to go
from contractor to, to being

720
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:16,043
pulled in house? Like you have
options and that's, that's really

721
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:21,682
exciting. It's not just like, oh,
I interviewed at this place, you

722
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:24,713
know, five times and they
finally, you know, want to do it,

723
00:45:24,862 --> 00:45:28,552
but the pay isn't as good. And I
don't know what I'm about to walk

724
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:32,813
into. You know what I mean? Like
you already know at least a

725
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,112
little bit.

726
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:36,472
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I
mean, that's a great point too.

727
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:41,063
And that occurred like something
that you just said, I was going

728
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:43,672
to say, made me have a thought,
which is a really ridiculous

729
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:48,262
sentence, um, is, uh,
contracting, you know, affords a

730
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:51,172
company's flexibility to, right.
So when you're hiring a

731
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:55,702
contractor, I mean, contracts
differ the setup, you know, lots

732
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,922
of times it's there for a fixed
date or whatever, either a fixed

733
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,202
project or a fixed date, you
know, but, but either way, it's

734
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:05,047
like, uh, You get freedom of both
sides, right? Cause you get the,

735
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:08,108
the, the company does like,
doesn't have to make a permanent

736
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:12,547
decision. You know, if you're
hiring somebody full-time the,

737
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,637
the expectation would not be for
just six months. You know what I

738
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:20,257
mean? And so, uh, like, I dunno,
I think that's another benefit

739
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:24,447
that people maybe overlooked
sometimes, um, is the benefit to

740
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,157
the company. So you can try
somebody out like that. Um, you

741
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:30,668
know, you can think about hiring
them or you can just, um, Keep

742
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:34,117
them contracting, um, things like
that. It's a cool way to have new

743
00:46:34,117 --> 00:46:38,137
people join your team or up, up
with your team, uh, in certain

744
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:41,168
situations, you know, uh, without
having to set aside the budget

745
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:44,358
for a whole new, you know, an
entire employee, you know, it's

746
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:44,677
cool.

747
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:47,818
Jessi: You also get the chance to
try some new stuff and like

748
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:50,487
different industries. And that's
always really cool. Cause you're

749
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:56,603
like, oh. This one, I, I got
some, you know, some experience

750
00:46:56,603 --> 00:47:00,262
like I, I, so I talked about a
little bit how I worked. I was

751
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:03,293
trying to go into medicine before
pandemic, and this is like a

752
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:06,983
medical company. So now I get to
try putting my knowledge in a

753
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:10,132
different way that I never ever
would have thought about. And I'm

754
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:13,702
like, do I like it? Do I not? You
know, do I still think that this

755
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:16,163
would be a good way to use the
skills? Like the, like the

756
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,532
non-traditional skills I already
have in a more like traditional

757
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:23,018
tech way. Um, you know, like
that's, That's really cool. And

758
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:26,588
I, I try to tell people like, oh,
you guys should take, uh, like

759
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:29,677
other devs who are just studying,
like take freelancing work. And

760
00:47:29,677 --> 00:47:32,887
they're like, oh, no, like it's a
scary to put yourself out there.

761
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:37,387
And how do I figure out how much
to charge or how do I do this?

762
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:41,722
Honestly like your communication
skills that you work on your

763
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:45,922
project, like project management
skills, um, those are all really

764
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,733
good things to have. And when you
do decide to like, try to go for

765
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,552
an interview, you already have
that skills and you can say, oh,

766
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:54,952
I worked on this client with, you
know, we did this, that and the

767
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:58,913
other, and here's the limitations
they had and things of that

768
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:02,092
that's really valuable,
especially if you're coming out

769
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:05,552
of a bootcamp or something like
it gives you experience that

770
00:48:06,402 --> 00:48:08,072
other graduates might not have.

771
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:12,168
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I think
you kind of what you've been

772
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:15,257
talking about there, this idea of
like getting energy and being

773
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:18,918
excited to try different things
is awesome. And I also love that,

774
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,952
but there's maybe a fine line
between. Trying new things and

775
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:25,893
spreading yourself thin,
especially when you're looking at

776
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:29,132
lots of different potential
projects, they do have any good

777
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,623
tips or advice on like how to not
do that.

778
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:39,148
Jessi: I'm still learning how to
do that. I, I am very much of the

779
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:42,418
opinion of like, try everything.
Cause then you'll find out what

780
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:45,057
you likes and what you don't
like. But at the same time, like

781
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:50,163
when you over commit, that's
really hard to remember, like, so

782
00:48:50,163 --> 00:48:54,152
I've been trying to like write
this down, like, okay. I, I over

783
00:48:54,152 --> 00:48:57,273
committed by doing this, this and
this. And I need to learn how to

784
00:48:57,273 --> 00:49:01,353
say no, but at the same time,
you're learning how to say no in

785
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:05,072
a way that helps give you depth
in other places. So it's not that

786
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:09,242
you're rejecting everything. It's
like, you're, you're saying,

787
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:13,023
okay, I really want to focus on
these things. And I really want

788
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:16,043
to, you know, take this
freelancing job that will help

789
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:20,813
maybe A, like, give me some
better networking skills and B,

790
00:49:20,913 --> 00:49:25,293
you know, I can put this on my
portfolio about this prod, this

791
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,552
work project or something. Um,
and this will, this will go

792
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:34,293
farther than to say yes. And
agree to the short term thing

793
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:38,103
that maybe is more stress or, um,
things like that.

794
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:43,313
Bekah: I really love that.
Especially this idea of writing

795
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:49,132
down what you've done to get what
I've done to get myself in this

796
00:49:49,132 --> 00:49:54,242
situation. Right. I feel like
there's something that can allow

797
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:58,443
me to analyze, okay, this is not
the right decision for you right

798
00:49:58,443 --> 00:50:02,853
now. It's okay to put it off
because you know, depth over

799
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:07,773
breadth a lot of the times. And
that can be really, really hard

800
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:12,302
when it's right in front of you.
And you think I might not have

801
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:17,282
this opportunity again, but you
know, like making it a deliberate

802
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:19,842
part of your decision-making
process is huge.

803
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:24,833
Jessi: Yeah, And that's part of
it for me was just kind of, um,

804
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:28,282
understanding that like, okay,
like when I first started in

805
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:31,463
tech, right, it was good to like
try everything because you know,

806
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:35,422
this, this go to this webinar and
go to this networking meeting and

807
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:39,143
go to, um, you know, whatever.
And then at a certain point I

808
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:43,623
realized. I'm kind of already in
tech and now I need to stop going

809
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:48,603
to everything. Right. And then it
became like, okay, but I don't

810
00:50:48,603 --> 00:50:53,612
have to accept everything that
comes to me. I can say no. And I

811
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:56,402
can, because then it would just
sort of became like the serotonin

812
00:50:56,402 --> 00:51:00,632
boost of like, yes, I will sign
up for this webinar. Yes, I will

813
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:03,873
do this. Okay. I'll take that
contract job. Right. But at a

814
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:07,818
certain point, like I have to be
honest about how much time I. And

815
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:11,447
that was like really weird. It
was like, oh right. I have like a

816
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:15,467
finite amount of time and
boundaries and you know, don't

817
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:20,987
want to burn out. So, um, I
should really like try to ignore

818
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:25,427
the serotonin boost of saying yes
to things and start focusing on

819
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:30,347
the like longer term, um, thing,
which is very difficult for me

820
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,588
because it's really impulsive to
be like, yes, I'll do that. Yes,

821
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:37,878
I'll do that. You know? And so
now I'm like, long-term what is,

822
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:39,588
long-term I have to think about
that now.

823
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,742
Bekah: Yeah, I feel that.

824
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:46,472
Dan: Yeah, for our listeners
Bekah and I are both emphatically

825
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:53,432
nodding was just talking. Um,
it's. Yeah. It, and I'm, I'm glad

826
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:56,418
you talked about that, Jesse,
because it's. It can be hard. And

827
00:51:56,418 --> 00:52:00,077
that, that actually can be one of
the hidden dangers of, um, being

828
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:04,427
independent, you know, is, is
that, uh, when you make your own

829
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:08,447
decisions, you get to freedom,
but then you get the, I suppose

830
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:12,737
the danger of that too, you know?
So it seems like, uh, it seems

831
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:15,527
like you're doing a good job of
kind of balancing everything

832
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:15,737
though.

833
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:20,947
Jessi: Thank you. I try my best.
Right. And it's it's how you, how

834
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:26,597
you avoid burnout? Cause burnout
is prevalent everywhere, so like,

835
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:31,338
like in tech, right. But you
know, we talk about like, oh, you

836
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:36,737
are a person, you have a life.
Um, you know, life goes on and

837
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:41,088
you are not your tech stack or
your, you know, your job, your

838
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:44,282
title. But especially hard when
you freelance, right? Because

839
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:47,882
you're like, oh, cool. So work
hours start to blend together.

840
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:54,452
And you know Yeah. Deadlines are
deadlines and yeah. So I am,

841
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:57,753
that's hard for me. That's just
about where I am right now.

842
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,592
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.

843
00:53:04,262 --> 00:53:06,603
Bekah: Yeah, I think it's a, it's
definitely a real challenge for

844
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:09,003
all of us who are working through
that. Especially like when we are

845
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:13,503
doing things that we enjoy doing,
it's really hard to stop doing

846
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:17,373
something that you like doing.
Uh, but there is something to be

847
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:21,782
said for having boundaries for
things. And like you said, you

848
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,682
are not your tech stack. And I
think that that's such a good

849
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:32,342
point to me. Um, we're at about
time now, but is there any bit of

850
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,672
advice whether you'd give to the
listeners or even to your past

851
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:39,182
self to say like, okay, this is,
this is how you bring the big

852
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:44,373
energy or, or find that thing
that will get you excited about

853
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:45,182
moving forward.

854
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:51,748
Jessi: I think it's mostly about
being honest with yourself. If,

855
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:56,788
if you, you know, like, okay,
maybe this to-do app that

856
00:53:56,788 --> 00:54:00,777
everybody else has done is not
really like making me excited

857
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:05,882
then you should do what excites
you? Like if you have a side

858
00:54:05,882 --> 00:54:09,842
project where, you know, like
that sandwich guy, like maybe

859
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:13,773
you're making the database of all
the sandwiches in every culture

860
00:54:14,132 --> 00:54:16,833
and that's what makes you
excited. You should do that. And

861
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:21,362
then talk about how excited you
are about sandwiches. Because the

862
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:24,813
only way to know, like, who else
is also thinking you want to say

863
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,452
it, which is, you know, we're
just fine with this analogy now.

864
00:54:27,753 --> 00:54:32,733
So even if that's it like, just,
just be honest, you know, like,

865
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:35,402
okay. So when I started with my
chess stuff, I was like, I don't

866
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,592
know how far this is going to
take me, but I'm really

867
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:40,382
interested in it. And I just
needed somewhere to talk about

868
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,963
it. And so I would just talk
about it online and I would blog

869
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:46,083
about it because I am a writer at
heart and I can't not write about

870
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,967
things. So that's just, it just
needed an outlet. I just didn't

871
00:54:49,967 --> 00:54:52,907
expect that it would do all these
other things that, that have

872
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:58,338
happened since. And so, um, yeah,
there'll be afraid to be yourself

873
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:03,288
because there's only one of you
and, you know, that's becomes

874
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:07,038
like this really, really great
thing, and it's not worth trying

875
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:11,657
to fit into the mold of, of every
other person. You know, if you're

876
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:16,467
a bootcamp grad, don't be just
another boot camp grad. You know,

877
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:18,958
be yourself who also happens to
be a bootcamp grad.

878
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:22,503
Bekah: Yeah, I love that. Thank
you so much. And thank you for
