sound right. How do you say that

34
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,408
four with Jessi Shakarian and,
um, we had a really great

35
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:49,257
conversation with her. Um, Jessi
has had. A really interesting

36
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:51,117
journey. Um, and she does, she
does UX and UI design with,

37
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:52,977
which

38
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,218
is a user experience and user
interface, um, design and

39
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,138
development, and, um, is a
really great conversation. She

40
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:00,058
talks

41
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:04,442
about how, um, she has, she has
different passions. Directly, or

42
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,513
at least originally weren't
directly related to work, but

43
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:09,573
how, if you're passionate about
something and you mix it into

44
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:13,473
your career path, that actually
can be a really know, a really

45
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,643
successful way to,

46
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,649
Bekah: cool way to be able to
bring energy to what you're

47
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:18,509
doing

48
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,599
for work, right? Like your work
does not have to be your energy,

49
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,769
but you can bring energy into
your work. And I thought that

50
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,939
was

51
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,199
a really fun way to think about
it because I haven't, I haven't

52
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,050
heard it talked about in that
way.

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,745
Dan: Yeah, exactly. Um, she has
a very unique story and, um, a

54
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:38,104
unique perspective on, on her
career. And I think on, in the

55
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:41,405
dev world in general. So, um, it
was just a really great

56
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:41,764
conversation.

57
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,104
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that
the rest of our episodes will

58
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,348
bring

59
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,045
something for everyone. And
we're very happy to be back for

60
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,560
season

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:59,268
four. So thanks for listening.
We start every episode of the

62
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:02,268
podcast. Like we start every
Virtual Coffee. We introduce

63
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:05,298
ourselves with our name, where
we're from, what we do and a

64
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:08,448
random check-in question.
Today's question is what is your

65
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:11,598
favorite

66
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:17,508
magical or mythological animal?
We hope you enjoy this episode.

67
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:23,318
Hi, I'm Bekah. I am a front end
developer from a small town in

68
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:29,138
Ohio. And my favorite magical or
mythological animal is I can't

69
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:33,737
remember anything. I would like
to say unicorn, but I am not

70
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,197
convinced that there's no such
thing as unicorns. Um, so

71
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,657
Pegasus

72
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,627
is Pegasus a unicorn that flies.
Cause I feel

73
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,943
Dan: I don't think a Pegasus is
a unicorn. I think it's just a

74
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:44,872
horse that flies.

75
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:48,572
Bekah: my favorite mythological
animal is unicorn Pegasus.

76
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,872
That's

77
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:52,052
it.

78
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,937
Dan: I'm sure there's a name for
that somewhere. I'm sure

79
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,301
somebody

80
00:03:55,302 --> 00:04:00,522
has written a name anyway. Hi,
I'm Dan. I am a front end

81
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:06,312
developer in Cleveland and, um,
Hm. Yeah, I don't have a good

82
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,397
answer for this. I did like, um,
I like the Griffins. Is that,

83
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,482
um,

84
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,513
is that the one in Harry Potter
with the it's like a bird with,

85
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:14,647
Bekah: Gryffendor

86
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:15,543
Dan: um,

87
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:16,687
Bekah: isn't it is that who

88
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,658
Dan: No, no, no. Like the birds,
they it's like a lion, you know,

89
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:26,237
body and a bird head and it has
wings. I don't know. I think

90
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:29,057
that's what it is. Uh, you know,
they, they like rescue it, you

91
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,398
know, it's like it like attacks
somebody and all that stuff.

92
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,993
Anyway. Um, I used to play Magic
The Gathering back in the day

93
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,778
and

94
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,352
there was, uh, there was a
whole, like, there's a bunch of

95
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:38,897
them in

96
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,350
there. You know, I had likea
whole... I was like them.

97
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,802
They're

98
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,713
cool. So that's, that's gonna be
one answer, assuming that I pick

99
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,442
the right name Griffin. I think
that, I think that's it.

100
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:55,098
Jessi: Hi, I'm Jessi. I'm a UX
designer in Los Angeles. And

101
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,757
let's see. Hmm. I feel like I'm
going to go with Pegasus just

102
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,507
because pegasus was always my
favorite. Like, I don't know. I

103
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,267
don't know if you guys remember
the, the Hercules movie, the

104
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,767
Disney one and pegasus was just
the best. I just loved him.

105
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,512
Dan: I actually have not ever
watched it. I tried watching it.

106
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,598
With my kids, because I want to,
you know, like, uh, and they

107
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,112
were, Ben was not that
interested in it at the time. So

108
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,626
I'm going

109
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:23,117
to give it a shot again. Cause I
was enjoying it. You know, it's

110
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:24,272
like one of those, you know, you
got four or five-year-old and

111
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,427
uh,

112
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,148
it's like, we're here mess with
whether they'll actually pay

113
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:31,218
attention to something that,
that is good. But I'm glad that

114
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:33,288
you

115
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,338
said that's good. Cause I'm not
trying to swing back to that

116
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,298
movie again. I have this whole
list of movies that like, I want

117
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,497
him to watch so that I can
watch.

118
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,302
Bekah: It's got a solid
soundtrack. I remember watching

119
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,462
it when I babysat in high school
and I still remember a lot of

120
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,622
the

121
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:49,142
soundtrack.

122
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,137
Jessi: It's really. Yeah. And
there's a lot of like, it's,

123
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:52,241
it's

124
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,002
funny for adults too. Cause I
recently rewatched it maybe a

125
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,307
year ago and I was like, Oh,
this movie's still hilarious.

126
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,612
It's

127
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,232
still, there's a reason why it's
still at the top of my, one of

128
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:01,852
my

129
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:03,262
favorites, Disney movies.

130
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:07,148
Dan: awesome. Um, okay. I looked
it up. Uh, it's an Alicorn.

131
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,148
Bekah: Yes, I looked it up too,
or Uni peg or a Pegacorn.

132
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:15,117
Dan: I also unipeg is really
awful. Yeah. That's, that's a

133
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,292
really bad one. Um, UniPegasus
is a very unimaginative one.

134
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,467
That's

135
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:20,127
showing up here too.

136
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:20,627
Bekah: Yeah,

137
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:24,677
Dan: I think Alicorn is the
right. I think that's, I like

138
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:24,937
that I think

139
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,202
Bekah: it needs its own name.
Cause these are really Pegasus

140
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,467
is

141
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:31,687
like very good name. It sounds
excellent. But all of these

142
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,077
sound?

143
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:38,762
Dan: Unipeg All right, Unipeg
that's Bekah's favorite animal.

144
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:42,418
Bekah: Yup.

145
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,552
Jessi: You heard it here first,
first?

146
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:46,533
Dan: That's right.

147
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,788
Bekah: Oh, Jessi. Thank you so
much for being here with us

148
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,767
today. Uh, we always love to get
started with your origin story.

149
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,122
So where have you been and how
did you get to this point in

150
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,386
your

151
00:06:59,387 --> 00:06:59,807
career?

152
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:07,322
Jessi: Um, it's I have a very
non-traditional path into, into

153
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:10,502
tech, um, prior to. The
pandemic. I was going back to

154
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:13,682
school to be

155
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:18,872
a medical lab tech and, and
endemic cabin. And I moved home

156
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:24,093
and I needed to start over. So I
took a career assessment to see

157
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,413
what else I could do. And, um, I
got a 100% match with

158
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,533
programming, which was super
weird. And I was like,

159
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:36,452
programming. Like, I don't know.
Okay. Let's try it because I

160
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:40,697
don't have anything else going
on. So I started teaching myself

161
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:44,222
how to code and, uh, by the end
of 2020, I was freelancing. Um,

162
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:47,747
I

163
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,847
just, basically, it was like
HTML, CSS and JavaScript and

164
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,947
took

165
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:55,398
some freelancing jobs and pretty
quickly realized that I loved

166
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:58,458
everything that happened before
it was time to code. And So

167
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,148
that's when I sort of switched
gears into, into UX, but I still

168
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:08,177
continue to use all my
development stuff as well. Yeah,

169
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,867
that's kind of how I ended up
here.

170
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,612
Bekah: So Prior to taking that
assessment, what was your

171
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:16,523
experience with tech and
computers?

172
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,298
Jessi: None. All I knew about
tech is that people code like

173
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:25,117
were coders and that was it.

174
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:26,478
Bekah: that's awesome

175
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,942
Dan: So, did your experience
match your, you know, your, uh,

176
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,253
your perspective, your pre
coding perspective?

177
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:37,398
Jessi: It totally blew it away,
honestly, because I was like, oh

178
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:42,317
my God, there's a whole world.
And then I pretty soon realized

179
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:46,697
that like, oh, every company is
a tech company now. So that's

180
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,957
really like a game changer and
it's up to you, what you want to

181
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:54,577
make of it. And I've never seen
an industry like that before.

182
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:56,670
Bekah: That is such a good
point. I love that. And I also

183
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,003
came from

184
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:03,373
a very non-technical background.
I was maybe the most technical

185
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:09,403
English teacher. So I taught
people about presentations in

186
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:12,942
integrating technology, into the
classroom and nothing to do with

187
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,277
coding. And so it was a, there
there's a real. I think

188
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:17,612
different

189
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:22,263
perspective almost if you don't
have that background, because

190
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,453
there's a lot of assumptions in
what people say about

191
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,643
technology.

192
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,577
Even now that sometimes I have
to ask, like, like, I would love

193
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,481
to

194
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,503
know, know what you are talking
about, but I don't have that

195
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,832
experience with that. And so
there's a lot of different

196
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,052
conversations, but good
conversations. I think that

197
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:46,044
happened as a result of that.
Okay, so now you did this pivot

198
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,114
into UX UI. I think it's a
pivot, but maybe you don't. So

199
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,153
I'll let

200
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,134
you talk about that for a
second. I think that when you

201
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,114
first

202
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:58,164
started coming to Virtual Coffee
is when I started to hear you

203
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,534
talk more about that. So what
got you interested in that

204
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,904
aspect of

205
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:06,875
things and actually, could you
define UX and UI first?

206
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:13,809
Jessi: Uh, sure. So, so UX is
like the organization of the

207
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,975
site. So which pages go, where
and where does the content go?

208
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:23,144
That it makes sense. What's the
research on like, who uses this

209
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:28,304
website? The UI? is more like,
where does the button go? How

210
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:32,024
does, um, particular components
work? Like there's still visual

211
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,975
components in UX, but also like
how those visual components

212
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:40,529
actually work. For the user, I
guess would probably be, um, a

213
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,500
way to describe it actually like
it's one of those things, the UX

214
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,615
versus UI, like comes up all the
time in like UX circles and

215
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,730
it's,

216
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,129
it's very like, it's very
interesting. Um, so yeah, I

217
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,929
actually started in Virtual
Coffee around the holidays last

218
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:03,000
year, and then now I'm still
doing dev stuff and like, You

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,310
know, this community is so
great. And then I started

220
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,620
falling out of

221
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,759
love with like JavaScript pretty
quickly. 'Cause I was like, I

222
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,379
don't know about this stuff like
programming, that that career

223
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,690
assessment was wrong basically.
And then spent quite a bit of

224
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,460
time, basically kinda networked
my way into an apprenticeship at

225
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,790
a design agency, like local to
me and. And then, so once I

226
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,120
started

227
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,750
kind of getting in the groove
with that, I was like, man, like

228
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,419
I should come back to Virtual
Coffee. Cause it was really fun,

229
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,909
but then it wasn't sure it was
like, but there's so many devs

230
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,960
and not too many like UX people.
So would it still be okay. And

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,700
that's what I kind of started,
like messaging you bekah of

232
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,440
like,

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,039
can I come back you're like,
duh. Yes.

234
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,190
Bekah: That's not what I said
for the record.

235
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,960
Jessi: Okay. I put, I put an LA
twist on that.

236
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,879
Dan: That's really interesting
though. And that like the

237
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,940
separation between that is, is,
like you said, it's like really

238
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,269
blurry. And even between
development, you know, I would

239
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,860
say that, um, anybody who's
developing is probably is like

240
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,450
making some UX decisions. So UX
is like user experience. Right.

241
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,539
And, and making some decisions
whether or not, you know, so

242
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,049
depends on the project, I
suppose, uh, what, how much is

243
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,479
dictated right to the developer.
Um, but even at the lowest

244
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,909
level,

245
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,019
you're, you're still affecting,
you know, somebody's going to

246
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,129
use

247
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,370
the thing that you're making.
Right. Um, and so when you're

248
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,620
coding, you know, you have, uh,
an idea of what the experience

249
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,870
is

250
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,310
going to be for the user and
what the interface, right. So UI

251
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,750
is

252
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,820
user interface or what the
interface is going to look like.

253
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,169
And, um, last times when you're
coding, then you get stuck into,

254
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,315
okay, I know what I want this
thing to do. You know, and it's

255
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,524
like, then it, you know, it can
be hard to actually get it to do

256
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:03,945
it or whatever that is the part
maybe that you I'm putting words

257
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,375
in your mouth, but like that you
didn't enjoy as much, but like

258
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,534
actually laying out the
experience for a user and like

259
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,205
how things should happen and you
know, what, what people should

260
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:13,530
see, stuff like that is what
you, uh, were more interested

261
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,855
in. Is

262
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:16,154
that right?

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,004
Jessi: I guess it was more like,
um, okay, so. So, like I had a

264
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,865
freelance project where I worked
like end to end. And so I, I, I,

265
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:31,004
in my twenties I wrote a lot. So
I, I spent, I spent upselled a

266
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:33,764
little bit and was like, oh, we
can write some copies, you know,

267
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:37,004
do some content strategy work.
And so we started from beginning

268
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:40,049
to end and, um, it was more
like, oh, like, how do I, I

269
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,094
don't

270
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:46,585
understand a website, right? Or
an app or whatever. And how do,

271
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,820
how do i cat-- almost categorize
and it gets very like nerdy,

272
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,090
right? Like, you know, what is
the hierarchy? Like? What's the

273
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,994
most important thing. What's
less of a priority. Um, and

274
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,898
things

275
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,339
like that. And that helps me
sort of understand the whole

276
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,779
picture.

277
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,870
And that's when I was like, oh,
this is really interesting. And

278
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,159
so I thought that I was like,
yeah, okay. Like UX all in. And

279
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,605
then I was like, but. Yeah.
right. Like you talked about

280
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:16,154
like, it's like, it's like an
onion and the layers of like,

281
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,789
okay, there's UX, but then you
go deeper than that and the UX

282
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,304
needs

283
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:24,044
to be coded, but then the visual
design needs to play a part just

284
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:30,674
as important. And is the, is the
context, correct? Like in your,

285
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,119
in your content strategy, like
there's so many components that

286
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,564
I

287
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:40,710
feel like I never left coding in
some ways, because I'm always

288
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,759
still thinking about it. How
does, how do you implement a

289
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,440
design change on a, on a coding
level, right? Can you implement

290
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,270
that, you know, legacy code and
all sorts of things, you know,

291
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,100
if

292
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,169
you don't have the source code
than what you know. And so the

293
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,429
skills I learned as a coder
still helped me in my work today

294
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,189
because. I'm now have a more
holistic approach to design.

295
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:07,949
Like

296
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,149
if I, I can see if, if, if a
client said, oh, I really like

297
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,009
this on a website, but I can
tell like, oh, is that

298
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,839
JavaScript? Or,

299
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,659
oh, I think that might be React.
And so research that, you know,

300
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,494
and so it still provides so
much, so much value and the

301
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,939
skills that

302
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,320
I learned, the analytical skills
problem-solving skills and on a

303
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,320
coding level, like I've never.
anything quite like that before,

304
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,850
if that makes sense, like, it's
been invaluable.

305
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,365
Dan: Yeah, that's awesome. I can
see how that, uh, the experience

306
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:45,514
would be really helpful. Maybe
even crucial to somebody who's

307
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,554
going to be, um, making high
level UX decisions, you know,

308
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,594
uh,

309
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,595
for, especially for websites and
stuff, because like you said,

310
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:55,085
there's, there's so many things
that go into all of those

311
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,809
decisions, you know, and if you
only have one piece of the

312
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,533
puzzle

313
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,346
in your mind, Well, you'll be
limited, I suppose. Uh, you

314
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:02,158
know,

315
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,370
about the decisions you can make
and things like that. I think

316
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,789
that's really cool. Um, can you
talk, you said you, you got an

317
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,704
apprenticeship, um, with a
studio and could you talk a

318
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,619
little bit

319
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,659
about that experience? Um, now
I'm asking more like from not

320
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,179
coding or not the like UX, like
what you're actually doing, but

321
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,580
like how the, how did the
apprenticeship like thing work?

322
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,585
Because I haven't talked to very
many people. Who've actually

323
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,590
gone

324
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,710
through a formal apprenticeship
and I'm very interested. about

325
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,029
that, just kind of talk about.

326
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:35,644
Jessi: Yeah. So are you, um,
there's a local, I have a local

327
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,584
UX group and, um, so one of the
people who run that UX group,

328
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,524
um,

329
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:46,894
they have a design agency. And
so, um, I sort of networked my

330
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,009
way into that local group of,
of, I was looking for a UX job

331
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,124
and

332
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:55,625
there was a recruiter and he was
like, oh, Hey, you live in our

333
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,910
area. You should join our group.
And I was like, oh cool. I had

334
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,195
no

335
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:04,424
idea. There was a us group here.
And so, you know, as I was

336
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,354
hanging out on that group, you
know, it was like on discord.

337
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,893
And

338
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,775
I was looking up, you know, on
LinkedIn trying to find some

339
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:16,125
stuff about like, who does these
different parts of UX? And I

340
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,414
ended up seeing one of the
people in our group, but I was

341
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,703
like, oh

342
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,154
my God, Hey, that's that's her.
And so I messaged her and was

343
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:25,875
like, Hey, you know, I, I saw
that you do some UX stuff. Like

344
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,524
that's really interesting. And
so she was like, Hey, you know,

345
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,173
I,

346
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,759
I, I run the design agency and
we have this apprenticeship

347
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,304
program.

348
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:37,184
Um, and so why don't you fill
out an application? Um, then I

349
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:39,674
got in

350
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:42,449
and, um, yeah, so I did about
six months of apprenticeship

351
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,744
where we

352
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:50,009
worked on different projects. So
some were personal projects. For

353
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,410
anybody who doesn't know, like
I'm now obsessed with chess

354
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,420
because of Queen's Gambit. And
so that was one project. And

355
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,430
then I

356
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,740
had some other things like the
information architecture

357
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,929
conference, which I worked on,
um, last year and now I'm back

358
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,118
on

359
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,849
this year. And so I learned, uh,
I gained a lot of skills by

360
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,579
being

361
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,789
an apprentice and working on
these projects and, and sort of

362
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:15,809
getting like a, a hand, like a
more real world experience about

363
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,094
how to do UX. Sort of brought in
like my coding experience

364
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:21,869
because

365
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,179
my boss is not a coder, so she'd
be like, oh, so wait, what do

366
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,009
you

367
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,289
think about ghost? You know, and
I, I want to move all my stuff

368
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,569
to

369
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:31,140
ghost see that. So then we talk
about that and then, you know,

370
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,915
so, so yeah, and then my
apprenticeship was six months.

371
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:34,690
So

372
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,369
this was January when I started.
And then by June I was done like

373
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,839
officially, like, you know,
promoted to a UX designer. And

374
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,309
then by July, uh, we got a
contract. That was just a good

375
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,874
fit for me. So, um, I started
that and that was more about

376
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,439
like

377
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,500
incorporating some machine
learning aspects and I had

378
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,215
already been learning Python.
Um, and so, yeah, that's

379
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,930
basically

380
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,690
been, been my, my journey, of my
apprenticeship. And now I have

381
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,059
two about to be two practices of
my own as, as they are starting.

382
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,170
Um, there are journeys into UX,
so that's true.

383
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:21,055
Dan: that's very cool. Yeah. Um,

384
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,500
Bekah: that was kind of what you
needed because it sounds like

385
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,160
before, when you were doing web
dev kind of stuff, it was, it

386
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,930
wasn't a good fit. And then that
changed seems like it was what

387
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,619
you needed to kind of, you know,
get you excited about what you

388
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:36,799
were doing.

389
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,085
Jessi: Yeah. You know, that's
the funny thing is the chess

390
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,825
stuff is

391
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:47,400
what brought me back to coding
because like they, the. Chess

392
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,259
engines and like the bots and
things they're, they're very

393
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,118
good

394
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,814
at particular things, but
there's a lot of like usability

395
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:54,509
things

396
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,839
that I really have a problem
with. And so I was like, okay,

397
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,534
I'm going to learn to code
again, specifically to deal with

398
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,019
this.

399
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,220
And I need to use Python and,
you know, some understand some

400
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,440
components of machine learning
to do that. And so that was. I

401
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,660
was

402
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,474
really nervous about it, but,
um, it ended up being really

403
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,288
fun. And

404
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,559
partly because I already had the
experience of Java, so maybe

405
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,130
jumped ship. Wasn't my bag, like
my best choice of their first

406
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,334
language, but it helps so much
learning Python because I

407
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,538
already

408
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,849
had the, like those fundamental
skills. And so. That was really

409
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,740
great because I was like, oh,
this coding is really fun. So it

410
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,169
became like another piece.
Right. And then I'm like, okay,

411
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,579
so we

412
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,589
got the UX stuff. We were doing
coding somewhere, coding stuff,

413
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,500
like, okay, cool. So I can kind
of sit with this and this feels

414
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,894
good. Right. It's just, it's
just about like, what's the

415
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,288
language

416
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,809
that's going to click with you.
And that is something that I did

417
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,960
not understand when I first
started. Cause I, I really did

418
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,900
did not like JavaScript. It was,
it was just stress me out so

419
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,875
much. But I'll turn it around
back in Python. I'm like, oh,

420
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,384
cool. It was awesome. Should
have chosen Python first.

421
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:06,470
Bekah: I think that investment
that comes from when you're

422
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,734
solving a problem, that you care
about goes a really long way.

423
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,758
And

424
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,480
to allow me to become interested
in what you're working on. I

425
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,240
mean, for sure you could do
projects that you're not

426
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,660
interested in the con in the
content or, or what you're

427
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,594
working with, but I find like,
it gets really exciting when

428
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,528
you're

429
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,704
like, I love this thing and I
know I can make it better,

430
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,879
right?

431
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,865
Jessi: And it also becomes like,
I know I can make it better, but

432
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,159
also no one else is going to
make it better. At least in the

433
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,453
way

434
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:39,104
that, you know, you will. So
then it'd be kind of becomes

435
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,754
like, I

436
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:43,875
kind of have to do this. And
that's what it felt like. I was

437
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,444
like, okay, these chess engines
have some usability components

438
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:48,794
that I really, really don't
like. And they're clearly made

439
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,144
by

440
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:55,529
programmers, like for. Um, chess
players who play a lot and I'm a

441
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,859
beginner. So this isn't really
like beginner oriented. And that

442
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,509
was my sort of initial quandary,
right. Of like, okay, I have to,

443
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:04,949
how do I fix this? Okay. I got
to start, go back and learn

444
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,389
Python.

445
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,654
Okay. But Yeah, that, that
really helps, like knowing you

446
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,588
have

447
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:13,440
something passionate about that
you'd want to spend a hundred

448
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,465
hours or whatever, working on
it. Like it makes a big

449
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,490
difference.

450
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,595
When I started, I didn't know.
Cause I was just kind of feeling

451
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:23,654
around in the dirt going okay.
Where do I start? A web dev.

452
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:24,944
Okay. Let's start there. Okay.

453
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,351
Dan: Yeah, I think, I think the.
You know, there, there's,

454
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,258
there's

455
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,880
a bunch of different pieces
obviously to, to learning, uh,

456
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,180
especially when you're learning
on your own like this and, you

457
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,549
know, finding a language that
you're comfortable in is part of

458
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:43,214
it, for sure. But I imagine...
what I've experienced myself and

459
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,285
notice through other people, as,
you know, having a project that

460
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,894
you care about, like you're like
you guys were just saying, um,

461
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:51,585
goes such a long way, right?
Because, because then it doesn't

462
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,070
matter if like, it doesn't
matter as much if the syntax is

463
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,555
weird in

464
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,259
whatever language you're using
or whatever, because if you,

465
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,963
you,

466
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,769
you, you know, if you're excited
about the project, then it's

467
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,574
just

468
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:05,085
like smooth everything out so
much. But for me, at least, um,

469
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,957
it seems like maybe for you to,
um, the, the, like, I dunno,

470
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:10,799
just

471
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,039
the being in there, you know,
like who cares, how many hours

472
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,299
you're doing on it. You know
what I mean? Like that sort of

473
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,559
feeling

474
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,925
when you get in that groove,
it's really cool. It's very

475
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,140
exciting.

476
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:22,984
Jessi: Yeah, no, it is. And
there's something really kind of

477
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:27,424
fun about like, okay. So
everybody, like in, in the UX

478
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:31,144
world pretty much knows me as
like the chess lady. And so

479
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:34,204
there's something really fun
about like how people know me

480
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,355
that way. And I'm like, okay, so
personal branding check done.

481
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:42,875
Right. But also that it becomes
like, well, if people get hooked

482
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,960
on. You can't, you can't fake
passion. Right. And that's,

483
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,130
that's a driving force because
things need to get done. And if

484
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,890
you're passionate about it, then
it will go a long way and

485
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,749
everybody will notice it. And
the other people who are I've

486
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,608
found

487
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:00,390
her, like, I don't know anything
about chess, but like, it's

488
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,029
really cool watching this
journey. Right. And that just

489
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:05,789
becomes really, really fun. And
I'm like, oh, okay. So it's

490
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,980
motivating, right? I'm not, I'm
not, um, I'm not being boring or

491
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,319
whatever, you know what I mean?
Like, like, I guess it's social

492
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,119
media, you know, if you don't
want to follow somebody, you

493
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,269
don't have to, but at the same
time who, who it brings to you

494
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,839
who gravitates to you? That also
becomes really interesting

495
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,799
because it's people I probably
never would have thought to talk

496
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,279
to or anything like that. If
that makes sense.

497
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,744
Dan: Absolutely. And it's, it's
one of those things too, where

498
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:38,234
since it's very clearly a, an
organic thing for you, you know,

499
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,645
um, everybody can tell that, you
know, you can, everybody can

500
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,025
tell

501
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:44,505
you're, you're passionate as
well, but it's. You mentioned

502
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:47,714
personal branding and that's
always, you know, uh, can be a

503
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:52,575
weird place to be, but like the,
um, I think leaning into

504
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,125
something you're passionate
about, like, this is it's, it's

505
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:59,835
always a smart move, you know?
And it's, I don't know, I kinda

506
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,007
lost my point. I was going to
say something about, um, He, you

507
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:04,169
can

508
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,624
tell when somebody wants to
like, wants to make a personal

509
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,078
brand,

510
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,650
but they don't have a thing like
that, you know, and therefore

511
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,484
forcing it or whatever. Um,
yeah. Right. And, um, I don't

512
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:16,169
know.

513
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,779
It's, it's, it's cool. And, and
I think this is good advice for

514
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,024
some, for other people, you
know, it's finding something

515
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,269
like that

516
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:26,579
and, and finding ways to use it,
to learn more or to spread your,

517
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,069
you know, spread your networking
or all of that stuff, all the

518
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,289
stuff that you've been doing.
It's very cool. And like chess

519
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,652
has. Well, it just got, I don't
know, popular, not popular is

520
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,015
not

521
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:37,035
the right word, but like, it
just got some press, chess just

522
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,055
got

523
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:39,254
some press right. With the, uh,
Queens gambit, you know, so I

524
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:40,453
was

525
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:43,065
like, people are kind of like
More back into it again, you

526
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:45,644
know, um, which is, which is
always interesting to see too.

527
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,894
Um, so I dunno. It's, it's very
cool.

528
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,414
Jessi: Yeah. And I will say that
I remember talking to a hiring

529
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:55,884
manager who said that he, they
hired some developers who made a

530
00:25:55,884 --> 00:26:00,325
website about sandwiches. You
know what I mean? Like okay.

531
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,502
Like, That dude just loved
sandwiches, but it worked

532
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:04,679
because

533
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,819
it showed on his, you know, on
his portfolio. And so it's like,

534
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,619
that's why I loved it. Like,
like before I started playing

535
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,389
chess, I

536
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,819
thought it was boring. And you
had to be like really smart to

537
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,430
understand it. And I was just
like, oh, I'm not that

538
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,109
intelligent to do it. But really
it's just about knowing what

539
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,690
you're yeah like, what your
passion is, but like, how do you

540
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,200
use that for your strengths and
your weaknesses? to show others,

541
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,340
to show hiring managers, what
you can do. It's just, it's just

542
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,480
a

543
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,560
vessel, right? It's and it
should be the thing that you

544
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,630
really

545
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,049
love.

546
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,359
Bekah: I think it's such great
advice too, because we hear a

547
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,784
lot

548
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:46,095
of people say like, you have to
be excited about tech. Uh, and I

549
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:50,204
think that you can be excited
about tech, but you can be

550
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:52,297
excited about something else,
and use tech to showcase that

551
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:54,390
thing.

552
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
And I think that that can be a
really great approach because

553
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
you're right. Like when you're
excited about something and

554
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,240
other

555
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,539
people get excited around you, I
don't know. It just creates this

556
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,039
like amazing energy. And I just
love that feeling of a really

557
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,914
enjoyed this. And now. Full
Bekah comes out like in those

558
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,209
situations where I can be
excited and passionate about

559
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,504
something,

560
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:21,944
we all talk about it together.
And this like very unique way

561
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:28,065
that doesn't happen when you're
kind of feeling out the industry

562
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,345
or the conversation or the
group. You can kind of let that

563
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:32,625
go a

564
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,495
little bit and just be excited
and allow everyone to be

565
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:36,365
excited.

566
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,674
In the conversation with you.
And that just feels great. It

567
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,954
feels

568
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:45,044
productive, but it feels deep
and deeper than things that I

569
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:47,954
think

570
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:52,934
we normally feel when we stick
to things that, that, you know,

571
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,874
maybe we don't really get
excited about, or we feel like,

572
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,423
well, we

573
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:01,964
should be excited about this. So
this is what we should talk

574
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:06,055
about. You know, talk about what
you want to talk about. And

575
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:10,075
that's how you find that like
really fun space.

576
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,410
Jessi: Yeah, Yeah. I think I
totally agree. Right? That's not

577
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,960
about chasing the trends because
the trends come and go. And to

578
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,950
me, it was, it was the
realization that like tech is so

579
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,940
big. And so if you make it what
you want, then you create the

580
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,329
space that you wish you want to
see. And other people will be

581
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,670
pretty happy if, you know,
there's always at least one

582
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,065
person who was like, oh, Hey,
you, you have just carved out

583
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:35,460
the

584
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,599
space of like building your own,
like Magic, The Gathering

585
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,359
database or cool. You know what,
I didn't like that this other

586
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,424
database doesn't have X, Y, and
Z. Right. So it just. It's it's

587
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:54,065
it's so framed. Right? You don't
have to fit into any particular

588
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:57,484
component. Like yeah. You could
chase chase the cloud book for

589
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:02,345
awhile. Like that's, that's a
very superficial, um, and

590
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:05,974
there's, it's definitely not
about like, that's like the tech

591
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,994
definitely comes second rather
than first. Right? It's about

592
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:11,659
making the thing that you want
to see, and that, that could be

593
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,324
the

594
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:15,957
software. Which is great, but it
could also be something else

595
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:18,589
that

596
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,500
everybody, any other, any like
non-tech people can use too.

597
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,274
Dan: Yeah, I love that. And
like, even just further on this

598
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:27,239
point,

599
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,839
like, if you are super into
something you don't have to, and

600
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,029
you were kind of saying this
too, but you don't have to make

601
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,219
like

602
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:35,309
the business decisions, you
know, like it doesn't have to be

603
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,569
some

604
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,730
successful product that you're
going to sell or something, you

605
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,359
know, uh, necessarily right. The
like sandwich website, probably

606
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,254
isn't making a ton of money,
but, but you know, the guy was

607
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:47,338
into it

608
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:50,609
and like had some fun and you
know, was able to learn some

609
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:51,764
stuff and probably helped him
get a job and all that stuff,

610
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:52,919
you

611
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,589
know, it's it's, I don't know.
It's cool. I, I do feel that

612
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:58,680
sometimes people lean too hard
on. What am I getting out of

613
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,045
this? Or, or what am I like,
what can I turn this into? Like

614
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,410
you

615
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,200
said, like the cloud or any, any
of the profit or any of that

616
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,330
stuff, you know? And when it's,
when it's something you are

617
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,460
just,

618
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,234
when you, when it's something
you just care about, like that

619
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,189
it's,

620
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,050
um, I don't know. The learning
just comes naturally. I feel

621
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,880
like

622
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,529
the benefits come, come out of,
out of that space.

623
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,329
Jessi: Think, oh, sorry.

624
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,890
Dan: No, I was done.

625
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,969
Jessi: Um, I was actually just
kind of thinking about how,

626
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,288
like,

627
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,670
you know, and there's a lot of
people coming out of bootcamps

628
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,170
and hiring managers start to see
the same projects over and over.

629
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,460
Right. So it's always like the
todo app and, uh, astrology app

630
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,849
and the, you know, tic-tac-toe
like, so. How do you stand out.

631
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,039
Right. And you have to be honest
with yourself. Like what's

632
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,970
something that I want to put in
the timeline and, and, you know,

633
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,289
be able to talk about with every
hire, every interview, you know,

634
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,374
and it should be something that
shows that, that excitement,

635
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,068
like

636
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,150
it's great to have made a
tic-tac-toe app or a, to do app,

637
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,129
but at the same time, like
what's a problem that we want to

638
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,078
solve.

639
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,115
That's going to help you stand
out, especially for. When you're

640
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,585
just trying to get your foot in
the door. Right. And you have

641
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:11,055
to,

642
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:18,164
to really be memorable, but you
have to just be yourself and you

643
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:21,404
have to show that, you know, and
that's, that can be hard for

644
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:21,825
people.

645
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:27,105
Bekah: I think that's such great
advice in, I think that. That's

646
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,784
that's something that you just
really have to recognize and

647
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,434
work

648
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,194
on. Like it's okay to be
different than other people. And

649
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:36,644
I think even traditional
schooling really pushes towards

650
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,394
the sanitisation of who you are.
Right. And like, well, what are

651
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:43,484
your achievements? Right. And so
for a lot of us, it's just

652
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,284
ingrained in our mindset that
the achievements are who we are.

653
00:31:45,284 --> 00:31:47,084
But

654
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:50,865
that's not, it it's about, you
know, the things that we enjoy,

655
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,814
the things that we are
passionate about and being able

656
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:54,734
to share

657
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,525
those things. And, you know,
sometimes it requires

658
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:01,484
vulnerability and sometimes it
can be scary because you know,

659
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,855
other people are out there and
they're like, I, I built this

660
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,765
great thing. And then, and then
you play that comparison game.

661
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,300
Like, well, I did, I as my thing
as good as that, but I think

662
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,835
that

663
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:18,375
you're always winning if you are
working towards something that

664
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:23,055
you enjoy doing or that you're
passionate about, and it doesn't

665
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:26,519
have to be tech related. I was
talking with a couple of members

666
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,900
in the coworking room yesterday.
W what, what, how would we like

667
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,960
new members to introduce
themselves? Right? Like what,

668
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,480
when they introduced themselves
in the welcome channel, what

669
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,839
should we ask them? And what
everybody said was what's

670
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,734
something outside of tech that
you enjoy, right. Those are the

671
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:46,625
fun connections that you make.
And I think it was Kirk. And he

672
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,805
was like, well, you know, I saw
somebody said they like fishing

673
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:51,325
and then somebody else responded
about the fishing. And now

674
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,080
they're talking like all of this
cool and fun stuff. And you

675
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,835
know,

676
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:59,394
if somebody came in, actually I
could probably tell you all of

677
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,599
the people who said, I like
weightlifting, like, yes, me

678
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,804
too.

679
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:08,005
Right. But if, if you asked me
to name all of the front end

680
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,834
developers, I couldn't
definitely couldn't do that. You

681
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,663
know?

682
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,825
Jessi: Yeah. Yeah, no. 'Cause
we're people, right. We have

683
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:21,869
multifaceted, you know,
interests and, and that's what

684
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,463
makes us

685
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:28,755
unique. And so why shouldn't we
show that this is how I am

686
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,410
different, right. But for, for
good, not in like a, not in a

687
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,065
bad

688
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:37,115
way or anything like that. You
know? being different is good.

689
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,569
Bekah: Right. And I think that
if you find companies too, Enjoy

690
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:45,869
that, or if they mentioned that,
and that's a good indication,

691
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:49,440
like, look, this person is
interested in more than just my

692
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,035
tech stack. They're interested
in the person in front of them

693
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,630
and

694
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,670
that's a really good place to
start.

695
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,470
Jessi: Absolutely.

696
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:03,855
Dan: I was man. I had something
to say before and now it's

697
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:06,892
totally gone. It was about,
yeah, it was a total different

698
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:09,929
topic.

699
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,829
So if we, uh, I didn't want to,
that's why, you know, it was

700
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:15,105
Bekah: Go for it.

701
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,380
Dan: all right. What I was going
to ask was, oh, kind of going

702
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,225
back to circling all the way
back to sort of toward the

703
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,070
beginning

704
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,070
of the conversation, but w we
were talking about, um, you're

705
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,469
working and what you're doing
now, and so are you, you're on

706
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,460
your own freelance now?

707
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,050
Jessi: Um, so I'm doing, uh,
wrapping up a, uh, contract

708
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,599
project for our agency, but, um,
Yeah, so generally I'm, I'm

709
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,239
pretty much freelancing
otherwise.

710
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,704
Dan: Yeah, this is what made me,
this is how it got here. It was

711
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:50,039
was, we were talking about.
That's being yourself and, you

712
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,260
know, companies hiring you and
stuff like that. And I've been,

713
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,900
I've been independent, you know,
for my entire career. So it's

714
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,679
like, one of the benefits of, of
that is, um, for me, is being

715
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,530
able to be myself a lot more,
you know? And I was wondering if

716
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,479
that, if that like, had enter in
your, your thought process

717
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,428
about,

718
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,400
um, instead of, you know, like
doing contract work and stuff

719
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,869
like that, as opposed to trying
to get hired or excuse me,um

720
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,194
maybe, you're trying to get
hired. I'm not, I'm not sure,

721
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,519
but

722
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,730
like, if you've decided to stay
on the contracting route, you

723
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,000
know, um, whether any of that
sort of thought went into your

724
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,389
went into your decision making
process.

725
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,534
Jessi: Yeah, it did. I mean, um,
I mean, I'm interested in, in

726
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:30,424
contract work. I, I'm still kind
of, I think I'll be almost a

727
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:33,314
full

728
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:37,394
year of contracting or general
freelancing. So, um, this has

729
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:39,089
been a really different
experiences from going from

730
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,784
like,

731
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:45,735
pre-tech like just having like a
regular stable job. Um, and I

732
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,104
think some part of it is like
the freedom of contract work and

733
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,473
I

734
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:55,275
can pick and choose what jobs
um, I'm excited about. And that

735
00:35:55,284 --> 00:36:00,420
that's really freeing, even
though it's more. Puts you more

736
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,349
in free fall if a job ends too
early or they don't pick you up

737
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:08,639
for the next round and things
like that. But I do find it more

738
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,979
rewarding to be able to pick
what I want to work on. Um, and

739
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:13,138
that,

740
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,610
that I think is also a part of
it of just accepting that this

741
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,670
is

742
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,599
who I am. And I kind of have a
bit of an entrepreneurial bug in

743
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,579
like, kind of just have to
accept that because, you know, I

744
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,559
don't

745
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,894
know how, how much like.
Full-time like, uh, you know,

746
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:36,255
regular stable job would fit my,
my, uh, like personality, I

747
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:38,475
guess. Um, and that, that
becomes really fun when people

748
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:40,695
are like,

749
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,359
oh, Hey, you know, I have this
thing. And I think he'd be

750
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,994
really

751
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,574
perfect to like, work on this.
And then it's like, yeah. Okay.

752
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,514
Like you thought I would be a
good fit, you know, instead of

753
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,584
having to me having to. you
know, argue for why I think I

754
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,654
would be

755
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:56,172
a good fit in a company
elsewhere. Um, you know, so

756
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,689
that,

757
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,039
that really becomes really
energizing because I'm now

758
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,279
accepting myself for my
strengths and weaknesses

759
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:08,519
career-wise um,

760
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,849
then that was something I always
felt like I had to find a stable

761
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,929
job and just do the nine to five
kind of grind, but also just

762
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,300
accepting that, like, maybe
that's not the right fit for me

763
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,440
because it's, it's quite taxing
and, you know, things like that.

764
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,400
So. It's much more fun to be
working in like quote-unquote

765
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,380
sprinting times of contract
work, if you break contract

766
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,360
work, but,

767
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,579
you know, we, I like to dig
deep, so that works really well

768
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,349
for me.

769
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,719
Um, and so, yeah, that's, I
think it's really exciting to be

770
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,578
like,

771
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,010
you know what, this is much
better for me. It's not

772
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:48,059
necessarily the status quo and
it's not quite as, um, you know,

773
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,792
what's the word I'm looking
for... Like it's not as. It's

774
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,454
not

775
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:54,505
in the norm. You know what I

776
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,650
Dan: I was going to say normal.

777
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,414
Jessi: it's not the norm, but
it's, it's okay to accept that

778
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:04,135
that's not just not gonna work
as well. That might change. And

779
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:05,755
that's the thing, right. I might
say right now, this isn't it.

780
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,375
But

781
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,195
six months from now, I might be
like, uh, you know what, I'm

782
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:12,715
tired of writing all those
proposals and then getting

783
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:14,634
rejected or not hearing from
them for three months or

784
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:16,553
whatever, you

785
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:19,969
know, I just want to clock in,
clock out. Or a year from now,

786
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,189
five years from now, whatever.
So that's also okay too. And

787
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:24,259
then

788
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,360
maybe one day you want to come
back to freelancing

789
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,210
Bekah: That's a good that's such
mindset.

790
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,380
Jessi: It's always about like,
having things open. Right. And

791
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,219
just seeing where things go.
That's always kind of been the

792
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,824
thing with tech for me is like,
okay, I'll just see what

793
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,429
happens.

794
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,144
100% massive programming, I
guess I'll try it. What's the

795
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:42,288
worst

796
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,300
that can happen. Right. I don't
like it.

797
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,619
Dan: I love that. I love the, I
love the way you said all of

798
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,434
that. Um, it, it lines up a lot
with the way that I fell too.

799
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,249
Um,

800
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,469
and I just, I just appreciated
that the, um, uh, man, my brain

801
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:07,900
is fried today. The, uh, yeah,
the, the freedom and the like

802
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:11,349
the, the ability to be more
individual I think is, is one of

803
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,564
those things. I've suggested
freelancing to people before.

804
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,779
And

805
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,449
they've like laughed at me or
scoffed at me or whatever, not

806
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,054
laughed at me, but you know,
like laughed at the idea. And,

807
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,659
um,

808
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,469
it's nice to hear, to hear
somebody like you that has been

809
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,960
successful and enjoys it. And,
you know, has the like, sort of

810
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,509
open-mindedness about it as
well. You know, it's, it seems

811
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:32,488
like a

812
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:35,670
healthy, a healthy mindset about
the whole thing, um, too.

813
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:38,325
Bekah: I, um, I, as soon as
they, when I was in bootcamp

814
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,545
before I

815
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,555
was. Um, maybe like in my last
three months, so it took me

816
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,565
about

817
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:49,545
a year. I went to this talk with
a founder of an organization and

818
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:51,015
I said, you know, I think I
would really like to freelance.

819
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:52,485
I'm a

820
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:54,840
mom. I like the flexible
schedule and, you know, to, to

821
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,195
not be

822
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:01,094
working 40 hours a week. And his
response to me was don't sell

823
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:05,625
yourself short and I'm like,
Hmm. I don't know that that's

824
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,140
accurate. Like, I don't think
I'm selling myself short. I

825
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,655
didn't

826
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:12,795
say that. I thought that I
couldn't do the work. I said,

827
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:14,475
this is what I'm looking for.
And there were so many people

828
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:16,155
who

829
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:21,344
said you won't be able to find a
job coming out of bootcamp as it

830
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:25,012
as a freelancer and I did. You
know, very quickly. And so it

831
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:28,619
is,

832
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,679
I mean, a lot of it's about
putting yourself out there, but

833
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,039
it's been for me a great
experience. And Jessi one of the

834
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,179
things that you said about, I'm
trying to think of the exact

835
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,174
words, but I can't, I can't
right now, something about, you

836
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:43,169
know, I

837
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,954
think you would be great for
this position. Right? And so

838
00:40:44,954 --> 00:40:46,738
I've

839
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,590
interviewed for full-time work
and I've interviewed, or had

840
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,045
conversations for contract work.
And like one of the things I

841
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:52,500
like

842
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,204
about contract. So far, most of
them have started because of

843
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,409
conversations. It's not been
this huge interview process

844
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:00,614
where I

845
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,729
feel like I need to prove
myself, like you were saying of

846
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,844
do, do

847
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:08,684
you think that I'm good enough
No, like there's already an

848
00:41:08,684 --> 00:41:10,004
established understanding and
it's come through networking

849
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:11,324
that

850
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:15,344
like, this would be a good fit.
Now let's continue this

851
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:20,025
conversation. Right. And that's
been. Huge. And, and one of the

852
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:25,125
reasons why I continue to prefer
that work because the anxiety

853
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:29,655
that comes with not only the
interview process, but all of

854
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:34,110
the. All the stuff that doesn't
make sense to me, I get like

855
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,670
super frustrated, like, why are
we even doing this? Like,

856
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,230
there's

857
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,329
not a point in, in doing this
portion of the interview or

858
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,428
doing

859
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,449
this portion of the application.
And that inefficiency just for

860
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,690
me, sends off like these red
flags in my brain where my brain

861
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,050
is like, Nope, not going to do
this. You know? And so it was

862
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:57,300
nice to just be able to work
together with people who are

863
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,860
focused on. I'm doing that, like
working together and enjoying

864
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,099
each other presence, you know?

865
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,150
Jessi: Yeah, no, I absolutely
agree. I think that the

866
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,549
interesting thing about, um,
like the contract job I'm on

867
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:13,948
right now

868
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,139
has been the, the internal team
they've asked, how can we help

869
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:24,135
you? And it's just like, Wow.
That's the first time I think

870
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,534
I've ever heard that, but that
doesn't mean that doesn't mean

871
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:30,224
that people don't do it, but in
terms of like, I've, you know,

872
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:33,164
done freelance work with other
freelancers, and then we just

873
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:36,045
kind of worked together, but to
have the, to have an internal

874
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:39,224
team be like, Hey, we want to
help you because you're helping

875
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,464
us. And, and that was really
cool and really welcoming rather

876
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:43,704
than.

877
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,445
I guess the stress of being like
the new person to the team and

878
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,085
being like, oh my God, I have to
catch up and do all this stuff.

879
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:53,025
But no, I worked, I was
completely separately from the

880
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:56,204
internal team and I just do my
thing and they just do their

881
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:58,394
thing and we would come together
when we need to, and we help

882
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:00,584
each

883
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:04,594
other, but then we still work
separately. So that's the

884
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:08,684
freedom, right? It's like, you
know, I might not know

885
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:10,671
everything. What they've done or
like what they're working on as

886
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,658
I

887
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:15,509
continue to work. But at the
same time, like there's a, it's

888
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,359
like a

889
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,030
different kind of camaraderie, I
guess, even though it's short

890
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,269
term.

891
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:23,693
Dan: Yeah, that's really cool
that that's, that's always an

892
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:26,932
interesting interface as well as
the freelance, especially with,

893
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:29,543
with, um, Uh, a company that has
developers, you know, um, so

894
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:32,123
lots

895
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,463
of times if you freelance,
freelance, just to somebody who

896
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:36,158
needs something, but doesn't
have any capability, you know?

897
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,853
Um, and

898
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:39,803
then other times it's like
you're doing now, you're helping

899
00:43:39,803 --> 00:43:41,753
out a

900
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:45,563
team that has developers, you
know, and th that's, uh, in my

901
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:47,160
experience has been an
interesting. Sort of thing to

902
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,757
see

903
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:52,507
how it, how it all works, you
know? Um, so I mean, it sounds

904
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,767
like you're in a really good
spot, a really good position.

905
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,027
Um,

906
00:43:55,088 --> 00:43:57,487
as far as communication and
contracting and stuff, uh, with

907
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:59,377
your current contract, um,
that's really cool. Have you had

908
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:01,267
any

909
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:03,667
other, I mean, you don't need to
say any like any bad

910
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,037
experiences,

911
00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:09,907
but like has like, has that been
the norm I suppose is my

912
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:11,587
question, um, you know, with
when you're, when you're dealing

913
00:44:11,587 --> 00:44:13,267
with

914
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:18,217
other teams, um, or has it been
any other interesting situations

915
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,538
that have come up? Um,

916
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:22,617
Jessi: Um, no, I mean, mostly
this is actually my first, like

917
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:26,318
really big, like, uh, Um, you
know, enterprise tech company.

918
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:28,203
So, um, everything I've done
prior has been like really

919
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,068
small,

920
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,227
like small-time clients and, or
like, uh, subcontracting work

921
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:34,237
for

922
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,697
other freelancers and just my
freelance network, um, and

923
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:39,157
things

924
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:40,522
like that. So that's why I was
like, oh, this is really cool.

925
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:41,887
We

926
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,279
get to come in, we get to help
people out. Um, and then. If

927
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:46,671
they

928
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:48,547
want to keep working with us.
That's great. If not, then

929
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:50,422
that's

930
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:54,052
okay. There's always other stuff
to do. Um, and that was just

931
00:44:54,052 --> 00:45:00,802
kinda, kind of nice to see that
you can get like a peek into a

932
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:04,762
team and see, do I like them? Do
I not like them? Do I like this

933
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:06,667
company? Is that something I
want to keep working on? Is that

934
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,572
a

935
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,782
company that I might want to go
from contractor to, to being

936
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,912
pulled in house? Like you have
options and that's, that's

937
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,042
really

938
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:18,862
exciting. It's not just like,
oh, I interviewed at this place,

939
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:21,681
you

940
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:23,197
know, five times and they
finally, you know, want to do

941
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:24,712
it,

942
00:45:24,862 --> 00:45:26,707
but the pay isn't as good. And I
don't know what I'm about to

943
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:28,552
walk

944
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:32,813
into. You know what I mean? Like
you already know at least a

945
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,112
little bit.

946
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:36,472
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I
mean, that's a great point too.

947
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:41,063
And that occurred like something
that you just said, I was going

948
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:43,672
to say, made me have a thought,
which is a really ridiculous

949
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:48,262
sentence, um, is, uh,
contracting, you know, affords a

950
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:51,172
company's flexibility to, right.
So when you're hiring a

951
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:55,702
contractor, I mean, contracts
differ the setup, you know, lots

952
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,922
of times it's there for a fixed
date or whatever, either a fixed

953
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,202
project or a fixed date, you
know, but, but either way, it's

954
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:02,624
like, uh, You get freedom of
both sides, right? Cause you get

955
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:05,046
the,

956
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:08,108
the, the company does like,
doesn't have to make a permanent

957
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:12,547
decision. You know, if you're
hiring somebody full-time the,

958
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,637
the expectation would not be for
just six months. You know what I

959
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:20,257
mean? And so, uh, like, I dunno,
I think that's another benefit

960
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:24,447
that people maybe overlooked
sometimes, um, is the benefit to

961
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,157
the company. So you can try
somebody out like that. Um, you

962
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:30,668
know, you can think about hiring
them or you can just, um, Keep

963
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,392
them contracting, um, things
like that. It's a cool way to

964
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:34,116
have new

965
00:46:34,117 --> 00:46:38,137
people join your team or up, up
with your team, uh, in certain

966
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:39,652
situations, you know, uh,
without having to set aside the

967
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:41,167
budget

968
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:44,358
for a whole new, you know, an
entire employee, you know, it's

969
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:44,677
cool.

970
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:47,818
Jessi: You also get the chance
to try some new stuff and like

971
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:50,487
different industries. And that's
always really cool. Cause you're

972
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:56,603
like, oh. This one, I, I got
some, you know, some experience

973
00:46:56,603 --> 00:47:00,262
like I, I, so I talked about a
little bit how I worked. I was

974
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:01,777
trying to go into medicine
before pandemic, and this is

975
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,292
like a

976
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:06,983
medical company. So now I get to
try putting my knowledge in a

977
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,557
different way that I never ever
would have thought about. And

978
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,131
I'm

979
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:11,917
like, do I like it? Do I not?
You know, do I still think that

980
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,702
this

981
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:16,163
would be a good way to use the
skills? Like the, like the

982
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,532
non-traditional skills I already
have in a more like traditional

983
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:23,018
tech way. Um, you know, like
that's, That's really cool. And

984
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:24,803
I, I try to tell people like,
oh, you guys should take, uh,

985
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:26,588
like

986
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:28,147
other devs who are just
studying, like take freelancing

987
00:47:28,147 --> 00:47:29,677
work. And

988
00:47:29,677 --> 00:47:31,282
they're like, oh, no, like it's
a scary to put yourself out

989
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,887
there.

990
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:37,387
And how do I figure out how much
to charge or how do I do this?

991
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:41,722
Honestly like your communication
skills that you work on your

992
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:45,922
project, like project management
skills, um, those are all really

993
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,948
good things to have. And when
you do decide to like, try to go

994
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,733
for

995
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,552
an interview, you already have
that skills and you can say, oh,

996
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:53,752
I worked on this client with,
you know, we did this, that and

997
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:54,952
the

998
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,932
other, and here's the
limitations they had and things

999
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:58,912
of that

1000
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:02,092
that's really valuable,
especially if you're coming out

1001
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:05,552
of a bootcamp or something like
it gives you experience that

1002
00:48:06,402 --> 00:48:08,072
other graduates might not have.

1003
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:12,168
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. I think
you kind of what you've been

1004
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:15,257
talking about there, this idea
of like getting energy and being

1005
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:17,087
excited to try different things
is awesome. And I also love

1006
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:18,917
that,

1007
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,952
but there's maybe a fine line
between. Trying new things and

1008
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:24,422
spreading yourself thin,
especially when you're looking

1009
00:48:24,422 --> 00:48:25,892
at

1010
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:29,132
lots of different potential
projects, they do have any good

1011
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,623
tips or advice on like how to
not do that.

1012
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,178
Jessi: I'm still learning how to
do that. I, I am very much of

1013
00:48:36,178 --> 00:48:39,148
the

1014
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:42,418
opinion of like, try everything.
Cause then you'll find out what

1015
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:45,057
you likes and what you don't
like. But at the same time, like

1016
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:47,820
when you over commit, that's
really hard to remember, like,

1017
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,162
so

1018
00:48:50,163 --> 00:48:54,152
I've been trying to like write
this down, like, okay. I, I over

1019
00:48:54,152 --> 00:48:55,712
committed by doing this, this
and this. And I need to learn

1020
00:48:55,712 --> 00:48:57,272
how to

1021
00:48:57,273 --> 00:49:01,353
say no, but at the same time,
you're learning how to say no in

1022
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,212
a way that helps give you depth
in other places. So it's not

1023
00:49:03,212 --> 00:49:05,071
that

1024
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,157
you're rejecting everything.
It's like, you're, you're

1025
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,242
saying,

1026
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:13,023
okay, I really want to focus on
these things. And I really want

1027
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:16,043
to, you know, take this
freelancing job that will help

1028
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:20,813
maybe A, like, give me some
better networking skills and B,

1029
00:49:20,913 --> 00:49:25,293
you know, I can put this on my
portfolio about this prod, this

1030
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,552
work project or something. Um,
and this will, this will go

1031
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:34,293
farther than to say yes. And
agree to the short term thing

1032
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:38,103
that maybe is more stress or,
um, things like that.

1033
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:43,313
Bekah: I really love that.
Especially this idea of writing

1034
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,222
down what you've done to get
what I've done to get myself in

1035
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:49,131
this

1036
00:49:49,132 --> 00:49:54,242
situation. Right. I feel like
there's something that can allow

1037
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:58,443
me to analyze, okay, this is not
the right decision for you right

1038
00:49:58,443 --> 00:50:02,853
now. It's okay to put it off
because you know, depth over

1039
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:07,773
breadth a lot of the times. And
that can be really, really hard

1040
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:12,302
when it's right in front of you.
And you think I might not have

1041
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:14,792
this opportunity again, but you
know, like making it a

1042
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,282
deliberate

1043
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:19,842
part of your decision-making
process is huge.

1044
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:24,833
Jessi: Yeah, And that's part of
it for me was just kind of, um,

1045
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:28,282
understanding that like, okay,
like when I first started in

1046
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:31,463
tech, right, it was good to like
try everything because you know,

1047
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,457
this, this go to this webinar
and go to this networking

1048
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:35,422
meeting and

1049
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:39,143
go to, um, you know, whatever.
And then at a certain point I

1050
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:41,383
realized. I'm kind of already in
tech and now I need to stop

1051
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:43,623
going

1052
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,113
to everything. Right. And then
it became like, okay, but I

1053
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:48,603
don't

1054
00:50:48,603 --> 00:50:53,612
have to accept everything that
comes to me. I can say no. And I

1055
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:55,007
can, because then it would just
sort of became like the

1056
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:56,402
serotonin

1057
00:50:56,402 --> 00:51:00,632
boost of like, yes, I will sign
up for this webinar. Yes, I will

1058
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:03,873
do this. Okay. I'll take that
contract job. Right. But at a

1059
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:05,845
certain point, like I have to be
honest about how much time I.

1060
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,817
And

1061
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:09,632
that was like really weird. It
was like, oh right. I have like

1062
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,446
a

1063
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:15,467
finite amount of time and
boundaries and you know, don't

1064
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:20,987
want to burn out. So, um, I
should really like try to ignore

1065
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:23,207
the serotonin boost of saying
yes to things and start focusing

1066
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:25,427
on

1067
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:30,347
the like longer term, um, thing,
which is very difficult for me

1068
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,588
because it's really impulsive to
be like, yes, I'll do that. Yes,

1069
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:37,878
I'll do that. You know? And so
now I'm like, long-term what is,

1070
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:39,588
long-term I have to think about
that now.

1071
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,742
Bekah: Yeah, I feel that.

1072
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:44,687
Dan: Yeah, for our listeners
Bekah and I are both

1073
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,472
emphatically

1074
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:49,952
nodding was just talking. Um,
it's. Yeah. It, and I'm, I'm

1075
00:51:49,952 --> 00:51:53,432
glad

1076
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:54,925
you talked about that, Jesse,
because it's. It can be hard.

1077
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:56,418
And

1078
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,247
that, that actually can be one
of the hidden dangers of, um,

1079
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,076
being

1080
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:04,427
independent, you know, is, is
that, uh, when you make your own

1081
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:08,447
decisions, you get to freedom,
but then you get the, I suppose

1082
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:10,592
the danger of that too, you
know? So it seems like, uh, it

1083
00:52:10,592 --> 00:52:12,737
seems

1084
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:15,527
like you're doing a good job of
kind of balancing everything

1085
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:15,737
though.

1086
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:18,717
Jessi: Thank you. I try my best.
Right. And it's it's how you,

1087
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,947
how

1088
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:23,822
you avoid burnout? Cause burnout
is prevalent everywhere, so

1089
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:26,597
like,

1090
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:28,977
like in tech, right. But you
know, we talk about like, oh,

1091
00:52:28,977 --> 00:52:31,337
you

1092
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:36,737
are a person, you have a life.
Um, you know, life goes on and

1093
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:41,088
you are not your tech stack or
your, you know, your job, your

1094
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:44,282
title. But especially hard when
you freelance, right? Because

1095
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:47,882
you're like, oh, cool. So work
hours start to blend together.

1096
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:54,452
And you know Yeah. Deadlines are
deadlines and yeah. So I am,

1097
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:57,753
that's hard for me. That's just
about where I am right now.

1098
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,592
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.

1099
00:53:04,262 --> 00:53:05,432
Bekah: Yeah, I think it's a,
it's definitely a real challenge

1100
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,602
for

1101
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:07,803
all of us who are working
through that. Especially like

1102
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:09,003
when we are

1103
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:11,253
doing things that we enjoy
doing, it's really hard to stop

1104
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,503
doing

1105
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:17,373
something that you like doing.
Uh, but there is something to be

1106
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:21,782
said for having boundaries for
things. And like you said, you

1107
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,682
are not your tech stack. And I
think that that's such a good

1108
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:29,012
point to me. Um, we're at about
time now, but is there any bit

1109
00:53:29,012 --> 00:53:32,342
of

1110
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,672
advice whether you'd give to the
listeners or even to your past

1111
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:39,182
self to say like, okay, this is,
this is how you bring the big

1112
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:44,373
energy or, or find that thing
that will get you excited about

1113
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:45,182
moving forward.

1114
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:51,748
Jessi: I think it's mostly about
being honest with yourself. If,

1115
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:56,788
if you, you know, like, okay,
maybe this to-do app that

1116
00:53:56,788 --> 00:54:00,777
everybody else has done is not
really like making me excited

1117
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:05,882
then you should do what excites
you? Like if you have a side

1118
00:54:05,882 --> 00:54:09,842
project where, you know, like
that sandwich guy, like maybe

1119
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,807
you're making the database of
all the sandwiches in every

1120
00:54:11,807 --> 00:54:13,772
culture

1121
00:54:14,132 --> 00:54:16,833
and that's what makes you
excited. You should do that. And

1122
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,097
then talk about how excited you
are about sandwiches. Because

1123
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:21,361
the

1124
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:24,813
only way to know, like, who else
is also thinking you want to say

1125
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,452
it, which is, you know, we're
just fine with this analogy now.

1126
00:54:27,753 --> 00:54:32,733
So even if that's it like, just,
just be honest, you know, like,

1127
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:35,402
okay. So when I started with my
chess stuff, I was like, I don't

1128
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,592
know how far this is going to
take me, but I'm really

1129
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:40,382
interested in it. And I just
needed somewhere to talk about

1130
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,963
it. And so I would just talk
about it online and I would blog

1131
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,523
about it because I am a writer
at heart and I can't not write

1132
00:54:44,523 --> 00:54:46,083
about

1133
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,967
things. So that's just, it just
needed an outlet. I just didn't

1134
00:54:49,967 --> 00:54:51,437
expect that it would do all
these other things that, that

1135
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:52,907
have

1136
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:55,622
happened since. And so, um,
yeah, there'll be afraid to be

1137
00:54:55,622 --> 00:54:58,337
yourself

1138
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:03,288
because there's only one of you
and, you know, that's becomes

1139
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:07,038
like this really, really great
