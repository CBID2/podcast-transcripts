00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,050
six of the Virtual Coffee
podcast.

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,550
I'm Bekah, and this is a podcast
that features members of the

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,300
Virtual Coffee community.
Virtual Coffee is an intimate

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,969
group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey.

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,759
And they're here on this podcast
sharing their stories and what

7
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,090
they've learned. And we're here
to share it with you. Here with

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,950
me today is my co host, Dan.

9
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,579
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today
we're talking with Courtney

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,759
Landau. Courtney is a software
engineer currently working at an

11
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,170
early stage startup in the
education technology space. We

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,810
talked with Courtney about how
the trend of constant self

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,170
marketing and Tech has impacted
her career. Our experience as a

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,140
developer and what it's been
like to take on a variety of

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,600
roles as a Virtual Coffee
contributor.

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,180
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode like we start

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,969
every Virtual Coffee, we
introduce ourselves with our

18
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,390
name, where we're from what we
do and a random check in

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,140
question. Today's random
question is, if you had to

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,640
delete all but three apps from
your smartphone, which ones

21
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,370
would you keep? We hope you
enjoyed this episode.

22
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:33,640
Hey, I'm Bekah, I am a front end
developer from a small town in

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,530
Ohio. And if I could keep three
apps on my smartphone, I think

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:52,810
it would be slack. Spotify.
And then Google Drive.

25
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,000
Dan Ott: Google Drive.
Nice. Yeah. So so one

26
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:02,709
entertainment, one and two sort
of work working once.

27
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,709
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That seems
to know what that says about me.

28
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:10,370
Dan Ott: Three's...three's
tough. Hi, I'm Dan. I am a front

29
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,169
end developer from Lakewood,
Ohio.

30
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,330
And if I so if I had to keep
three apps, I thought I would do

31
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:24,860
Spotify as well. I would do
overcast, it's just podcast app.

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,030
And that I listen to pretty much
all time. And I don't know. I

33
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,949
feel like some kind of game
except that I can't really get

34
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:38,870
into any games right now. I'm in
between games right now. So I

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,969
don't really have a good I guess
I'll say slack. But like I was

36
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,159
kind of honestly looking forward
to not having slack on my phone

37
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,680
in this imaginary, you know,
thing. But slack is probably

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,870
pretty lost without having slack
on my phone. So that'll be my

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,639
choice. Choice three, slack.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,009
Courtney Landau: Hi, I'm
Courtney. I'm a software

41
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:59,479
developer from Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania. And three

42
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,000
apps that I would keep were are
gonna sound like everybody

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,159
else's now overcast, number one,
Spotify. And I would definitely

44
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,199
not keep slack Just saying. And
I guess Instagram.

45
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,129
Yeah, because I do like the
photos.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Dan Ott: I have, like, you know,
I could do pretty easily without

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,610
Twitter. I'm not on Instagram
anymore. I was like, thinking

48
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:35,120
about
was it? Oh, things like my to do

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,289
app? You know, except that I
know. I never use it.

50
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,210
Courtney Landau: would happily
give up any of the work apps?

51
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,020
Yeah.

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,560
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was like
between slack and Twitter. I

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,990
couldn't decide. But

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
Dan Ott: well, Twitter, you can
more easily get on. Just on

55
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,669
safari. Right. Like I was
thinking.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,379
Courtney Landau: That's true

57
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,080
Dan Ott: slack's a little... I
don't know, slack works on the

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,610
phone through the web.
You know, I know you can on your

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,819
computer on the web. But
regardless, I mentioned it would

60
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,819
not be the fun.

61
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,159
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah. All
right. Oh, thanks, Courtney, for

62
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,699
being here today. We're very,
very excited to be talking to

63
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,069
you. And usually the way we get
started is asking our guests how

64
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,670
they got into tech. So can you
give us a little bit about your

65
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,769
background and how you ended up
where you are today?

66
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,439
Courtney Landau: Yeah, um, so I
am Yeah, a career changer. So I

67
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,730
came from clinical field. I was
CAT scan tech. Well, actually, I

68
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,850
still work per diem as CAT scan
tech once in a while in the

69
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,040
hospital.
So yeah, I did that while

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,829
out. I went to X ray school after
and then I did CAT scan for a

71
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:58,759
long time had kids and when they
were young, I worked the weekend

72
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:02,839
program. Kind of
While they were young the entire

73
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,000
time, so I worked 212 hour
shifts on the weekend. And

74
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,879
so that was great for when they
were young. But when they were

75
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,970
going back to school, I ended up
thinking I wanted to change

76
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,350
careers. And I really liked tech.

77
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,680
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: What it
what interested you about tech?

78
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,600
Courtney Landau: Yeah, so I was
really into

79
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:28,790
kind of computers. So I kind of
went, thought it would, I would

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,180
get a master's in
Information Sciences kind of go

81
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:38,209
into like, stay in medical, but
kind of do like more like an IT

82
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:57,949
thing. But then I took
working out problems. And that

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:04,129
kind of led me to focus my
master's on coding moreso than

84
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:07,670
it so while I was doing the
Masters, I was kind of building

85
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:11,930
a bunch of working on Free Code
Camp at the same time kind of

86
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:15,560
doing web dev stuff, along with
my coursework. And that kind of

87
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,370
led me into web dev once I
graduated.

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Nice, what
is your master's in?

89
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,680
Courtney Landau: Information
Sciences. So I kind of it was my

90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,639
bachelor's in biology. So
what I went when I found that

91
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:36,389
this program was local, and I
could go in like half time, so

92
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,920
when I was first starting, like
doing these, I did kind of some

93
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:45,870
MOOCs online, like with coding,
and it kind of see what I would

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:51,420
like, and I, I figured I could,
because you could kind of

95
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:56,970
structure your classes around.
Like, either like development or

96
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,939
it more I and I did take some it
classes along with it, but most

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,410
of them were like, all
coding classes. So

98
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,470
Dan Ott: Oh, that's so cool. So
yeah, so when you started your

99
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,540
master's program, you weren't
really thinking about coding at

100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:33,379
all. interesting.

101
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,970
Courtney Landau: Yeah,

102
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:36,490
Dan Ott: that's really cool.

103
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,800
Courtney Landau: I didn't want
to do like a boot camp type

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,370
thing, because

105
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,500
Unknown: really solidifying it.

106
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,879
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Nice. And
so then what was the transition,

107
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,319
like, from your job at the
hospital to your first job in

108
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:11,740
tech?

109
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:15,430
Courtney Landau: Yeah. So um, I
ended up well, I was still

110
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,850
working the weekends, like, I
worked weekends for probably 10

111
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,740
years. And so when I was about
to graduate, I was kind of

112
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,589
applying when I was in school,
but nothing worked out. And then

113
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,050
I when I was about to graduate,
I managed to land an internship,

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:10:02,080
so I, a paid internship full
time, so Really like

115
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,169
software developments more,
using more my brain basically,

116
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:12,450
it's got CAT scan, there's not
really any room for, like,

117
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:19,200
moving up, there's no, it's
either like management or go to

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,070
school and become like, I don't
know, pa or a doctor. But yeah.

119
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,600
So yeah, I like being in
software development now.

120
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,200
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Did that
internship lead to a full time

121
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,679
job?

122
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,600
Courtney Landau: Right now, um,
the internship did not lead to a

123
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,220
full time job. I was hoping that
it would. But they were not

124
00:10:41,220 --> 00:11:59,919
hiring at the end of it. So no
one got hired. big company,

125
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,679
Dell, which was would have been
about an hour and 15 minute

126
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:11,009
drive. And so I had that offer.
And then the very, very small

127
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,070
startup where I would be the
only developer and working from

128
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,850
home. So I ultimately chose this
one, obviously. So yeah, I've

129
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,279
been there since September of 19.

130
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,899
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Wow, I feel
like that's a little bit

131
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,500
overwhelming. When you were
talking about the commute to the

132
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,980
other job. I thought like why
why definitely pick the remote

133
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,159
one. But then also being new to
the industry. And being the only

134
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,970
developer seems a little bit
overwhelming. How was that for

135
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,389
you?

136
00:12:46,529 --> 00:14:23,100
Courtney Landau: Right, yeah.
And it's here and almost a half.

137
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,100
So

138
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,669
Dan Ott: that's really cool.
That's cool that they, you know,

139
00:14:31,590 --> 00:15:03,090
newer career developer,
You don't have a somebody else

140
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,570
that, you know, that was there
before.

141
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,009
Courtney Landau: Right. So, um,
I had the CTO who

142
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,960
I don't know how much he
actually built. I think he

143
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,820
contracted out I think, a lot of
it. So coming, I came into that.

144
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,059
And so
can you repeat that question?

145
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,059
Sorry?

146
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,019
Dan Ott: Oh, yeah, well, no,
that makes sense. Because

147
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,440
usually, if anybody has listened
to this podcast for a while,

148
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,129
they will know that I will talk
for like a minute or two and

149
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,450
ask, like, several questions. In
the middle of the sentences, no

150
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,220
worries. The first question I
was wondering about was what you

151
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,549
answered was like, you know, if
you were the only developer who

152
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,330
built it, and then the second
part was, was, yeah, like, talk

153
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,129
more, can you? I was just
wondering if you could talk more

154
00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:00,690
about
what it was like getting used to

155
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,740
like that, that codebase. I
know, they they said,

156
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,370
or you said that they sent you
to some view training and stuff,

157
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,889
which is really cool. But
just in general, like not having

158
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:13,139
a another developer to sort of
lean on for questions. I was

159
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,940
just, I was just curious, let
you know what that looks like

160
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,940
for you.

161
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,159
Courtney Landau: Right? Yeah.
Um, yeah, a lot of the majority

162
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,009
of like, the code that was
written at that point was the

163
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,279
Chrome extension, which does a
lot of like website tracking,

164
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,370
and doesn't use a lot of the
chrome API's.

165
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,950
So that was pretty complex, and
kind of overwhelming at first.

166
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:44,009
But really, the Vue app was
the easy part. So and I did have

167
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:47,970
him too. He was available, you
know, he still is available to

168
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:50,549
for but it's at this point, he's
more like big questions, big

169
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,990
picture questions.
And a lot of the stuff he's

170
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,279
like, I don't know, JavaScript,
so. Okay, you're on your own. But

171
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,319
yeah, no, it was actually like,
the first thing I'm remembering

172
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,500
now that the first thing that I
had to fix was like a bug. So I

173
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,640
had to get root in the Chrome
extension to really dig in to

174
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:20,430
like off things. And
so that was a lot. But yeah, it

175
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:26,549
worked itself out. For
questions. Yeah, I either go to

176
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:31,410
him or go to, like, I use
discord a lot like the when I

177
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,630
had Firebase questions, there's
pretty helpful discord on that.

178
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,630
And

179
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,299
Dan Ott: That's awesome. Yeah,
so the CTO was, like, maybe

180
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,660
didn't write most of the code,
but at least was familiar enough

181
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,809
with it, you know, because he
worked with custom contracts

182
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,440
with whatever to point the way
and answer some big questions.

183
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,660
That is, so you're still though,
like, you're still the the only

184
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,539
developer there. At this point?
After?

185
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:57,930
Courtney Landau: Yep.

186
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,420
Dan Ott: How long was it? A year
and

187
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,170
Courtney Landau: September of
19. So yeah.

188
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,029
Dan Ott: But I mean, that's
really cool. It's like I was, so

189
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,549
being a solo developer, you
know, you have, there's,

190
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:14,730
there's, as you know, there's,
you know, some different

191
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,369
responsibilities. So, what is it
like for you, When, when, when

192
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:26,670
they have a new feature, you
know, that they? I guess I'm not

193
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,980
gonna I don't want to lead the
question too much. What is what

194
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,819
is like, you know, when you when
they have a new feature that

195
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,440
they'd like, you know, to
implement?

196
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,240
Courtney Landau: Right, so, um,
basically, I handle it all I

197
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,119
have to come up with like, the,
my plan and kind of, like, mock

198
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,559
stuff up for them. And for new
features, I'm pretty much

199
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,470
handling Yeah, still, at this
point, handling all the whole

200
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:02,369
process from start to finish.
And they're really good with

201
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:08,549
that, that's, they're not like
impatient with me, I'm sure.

202
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,450
Especially in the beginning,
things took longer than they

203
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,019
could have with a more
experienced developer. But, um,

204
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,869
yeah, so.

205
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,450
Dan Ott: I mean, that's, that's
great. Like, when I was sort of

206
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,720
getting I was it's a lot of
responsibility for for any

207
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,890
developer, right, like,
regardless of their experience

208
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,329
level, or, you know, the path in
their career. And it seems like

209
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,450
it seems like it's a really good
fit, you know, I don't know it

210
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,460
seems like pretty cool situation
to be in.

211
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,059
Courtney Landau: Yes, I'm sorry.

212
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:48,569
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: No, I was
just gonna say I think that it's

213
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:51,450
amazing what you're doing.
You're talking through all of

214
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,259
this stuff, but you know, coming
on and working on all this stuff

215
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,819
by yourself. I just think is is
a pretty big, I don't know if I

216
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,660
want to accomplishment, or it's
just something that I certainly

217
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,750
admire hearing you talk about,
because I don't I don't think

218
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,329
that I would have been confident
enough to take on something like

219
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:12,779
that.

220
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,759
Courtney Landau: Yeah, thank
you. But I don't always feel

221
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,809
that way, like the actual coding
and stuff. But that's my

222
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,930
favorite part. I don't really
like all the time planning

223
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,680
everything out and having to go
through. I mean, I'm getting

224
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,809
better at it, I think. But I
wish I had a project manager to

225
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,200
tell me what to do. Sometimes I
just want to like pull a ticket

226
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,369
off a JIRA board and call it a
day. But yeah, I like it. I

227
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:46,319
mean, and also, I get to do
other things like, not just

228
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,049
coding, I get to talk directly
with teachers. So it's an

229
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:55,559
education, tech nology. thing.
So I, like I get to have

230
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,670
meetings with teachers and talk
through features and like, build

231
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,329
what they want to like with, you
know, the founders, if they

232
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,930
agree and see how they, you
know, have meetings with them,

233
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,920
and see how they react when I
build something that they want

234
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,019
it. And that's awesome.

235
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:14,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
really cool.

236
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,329
Dan Ott: That's very cool.

237
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,869
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I want to
talk a little bit about this is

238
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:24,000
like changing gears a little
bit, but you had this tweet that

239
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:28,200
I was really, I really enjoyed,
but it's as quiet and soft

240
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,980
spoken doesn't mean
inexperienced. And I thought

241
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,140
that was so good, and powerful
and important. Because tech is

242
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,869
kind of a really loud place
right now. Right? And we're

243
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,809
always talking about, like,
marketing yourself and putting

244
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:47,190
yourself out there. And so,
people kind of have to like, be

245
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,359
a marketer, or be a devrel for
themselves to get new jobs. And

246
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,549
so I, I wanted to hear you kind
of talk through, you know, maybe

247
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:01,470
one what this tweet means to
you, or, you know, how being

248
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:08,549
somebody that is quiet or soft
spoken, has impacted your tech

249
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:09,089
journey?

250
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:16,529
Courtney Landau: Yeah, um, so
I've always been pretty quiet

251
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:24,089
person, especially when I first
meet people definitely tend to

252
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,650
more keep things in. But then
once I like, once I'm

253
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,359
comfortable, I am probably
completely the opposite. I don't

254
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:42,150
know. I do, like really like to
talk. I really. I like, so in

255
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,380
tech, and just in general, I
feel like even in my previous

256
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:53,730
career, I feel like sometimes
people take your quietness for

257
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:02,730
not knowing what you're talking
about, or, but yeah, I, and I

258
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,650
feel like that continues to
happen, where I'm not like, out

259
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,650
there all the time. And like, I
like on Twitter, like, I'm

260
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,849
barely tweet at all because I
like, well, Major, I really

261
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,940
can't think of anything else. We
don't have the time, but pretty

262
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,140
much. But I don't know how
people come up with stuff. But

263
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,609
I'm saying, especially tech
related, like, I feel like

264
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:34,920
everything I type, everything I
write will be boring. And But

265
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,869
anyway, yeah. So I feel like,
also, I think, like just being

266
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:42,930
quiet and not like speaking up
for yourself all the time, just

267
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,619
like constantly saying what
you're doing and things it makes

268
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,039
people maybe like, assume that
you may not have experienced or

269
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,519
know what you're talking about.
I'm not sure. But

270
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,500
Dan Ott: yeah, it's I mean, it's
interesting. I mean, I really

271
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,109
like the way you phrase that. I
mean, I've I feel like I've

272
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,569
can't be the same way,
especially with with Twitter and

273
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,359
things like that. I never even
never even occurs to me until

274
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,890
much later to tweet things. Like
when they're happening, you

275
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:20,630
know? And I don't know. Yeah,
and I, and the same with trying

276
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,069
to, like, think of ideas to
tweet about or read about or

277
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,089
anything, you know, it's just a
weird process to me. When I'm

278
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:32,720
coding. It's the farthest thing
from my brain, you know,

279
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:36,230
Courtney Landau: right. Yeah.
And I also feel like, there's

280
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,589
kind of, it's kind of, we're on
Twitter, and we're reading, you

281
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:46,369
know, Twitter, but there are a
ton of people that are

282
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:49,220
developers that don't have
Twitter at all. They just, you

283
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,609
know, work and do their thing.
And or same with like, open

284
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,160
source they don't like there's a
lot of people who just do their

285
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,309
job and then go home. If it's
not open source, then it's not

286
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,329
out there. But that doesn't mean
like they don't know what

287
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,759
they're doing. You know? I don't
know.

288
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,259
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure. And I think, you know,

289
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,670
since there's just such a focus
on people who are out there

290
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,240
talking a lot, and I was just
thinking back, like, you've been

291
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,700
coming to Virtual Coffee for a
while, and I think like your

292
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,690
first involvement in coming to
more than, like, our coffee

293
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,240
chats was with HacktoberFest,
and you sign up as a mentor, and

294
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,940
a contributor. And I think, you
know, it was funny, because it

295
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:44,349
kind of made me think about
this. Um, I don't know how to

296
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,710
say this. I was surprised, I'll
say that you signed up as a

297
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,670
mentor. And I had to kind of
like, check myself because you

298
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,049
are quiet. And thinking about
like, okay, there are different

299
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:59,980
people who are acting in
different roles. And so it's

300
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:03,069
important to, you know, like, I
don't think that I made an

301
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,549
assumption about you being
quiet. But I also think that I

302
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,839
didn't think to, like, reach out
to you and say, like, hey, do

303
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,380
you want to play a bigger role
in this? And so like, it was

304
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,759
great to see you do that. And
all of the support that you gave

305
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:24,039
was amazing. So I know, it was
like a nice check for me in

306
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,859
terms of thinking about all the
members of the community and how

307
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,539
we all work differently.

308
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:37,210
Courtney Landau: Yeah. Thanks.
Um, yeah, I really, like I feel

309
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,359
I've been doing web dev kind of
since probably, at this point. I

310
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,440
was doing Free Code Camp
probably started that in 2016.

311
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:53,079
And then yeah. And so I've been
doing kind of JavaScript, HTML

312
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:59,200
and CSS for a while. And I felt
like I could. Now that I've been

313
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,109
more, even though at that point,
maybe been working a year, I

314
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:06,339
guess. Like, I could definitely
help out someone new or someone

315
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,420
completely in boot camp, like,
and I really like working with

316
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,359
people who are really new,
because I like sharing my

317
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,819
knowledge. And even though I
still feel like I know nothing,

318
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:23,230
I do know a little bit more than
when I started. So yeah, so I

319
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,799
worked with someone who's in
boot camp, and that was a great

320
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,700
experience. And also back when I
was learning, like, I was, like,

321
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,019
I my, I did a couple
contributions to Free Code Camp

322
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:40,210
actually. And so the but I never
finished a whole HacktoberFest

323
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:48,279
because I just never found was
able to. So I liked being able

324
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,390
to help someone through that.

325
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,920
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,
that's awesome. And, and I know,

326
00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:01,690
I mean, you were paired with
Andrea, right? You had one. And

327
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,630
she definitely benefited from
that she I just remember her

328
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,349
saying, like, what a great
experience it was to work with

329
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:11,619
you. And it's just so great to
see like those connections

330
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,660
happening and the community
supporting one another. So that

331
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,390
was, I don't know. Something
that I really enjoyed seeing

332
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:22,930
happen.

333
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,549
Courtney Landau: Yeah, I mean,
community is great. And I try to

334
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,089
help out as much as I can. Yeah,
when I came into Free Code, I'm

335
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:36,880
talking about Free Code Camp now
I'm talking about Virtual

336
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:46,269
Coffee. It was really great for
me because I was working on

337
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,839
still am working by myself. And
I really don't know anybody in

338
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,359
tech. Besides like, the three
guys that were on my team at my

339
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:02,410
internship, and so when you were
tweeting about Virtual Coffee

340
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:10,779
and even before the pandemic, I
was working from home, so I was

341
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:13,480
really excited and then the
slack group and it's just been

342
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,950
so great. Like I made so many
friends in tech now.

343
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,109
Dan Ott: That's, it's, it's
pretty cool. I was gonna ask

344
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:33,099
like, you know, given not sure
how to phrase this, but like

345
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:38,440
given your, like quietness and
what is the what is the right

346
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,640
word for that? But like, given
the fact that you know, you

347
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,259
know, you're not out there like
tweeting all the time, you're

348
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:49,059
not doing a lot of that other
stuff. I still see you getting

349
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,950
involved in you know, things
like Bekah was saying that

350
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,430
HacktoberFest and you You know,
I've given talks at our

351
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,539
lightning talks. For instance,
do you find yourself like

352
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:05,259
looking for ways to To create
content or like, you know, do

353
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:09,609
things like that. Other than,
you know, I don't know, the

354
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,009
traditional, like, tweets and
whatever, that you know, a lot

355
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,029
of other developers do.

356
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:17,799
Courtney Landau: Yeah, um, I
think, like, we're the lightning

357
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,619
talks are concerned and things
like that. I do want to put

358
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:26,650
myself out there. And it's more
like me making myself do things

359
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,970
that are outside of my comfort
zone like so

360
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,450
Dan Ott: Totally

361
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,109
Courtney Landau: yeah, because I
get, you know, even like this

362
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:41,079
podcast, get so nervous, for it,
but, yeah, it's good for, you

363
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,750
know, I could easily just stay
in my office and not contribute,

364
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,589
but I want to get out there and
I do benefit a lot from it. So

365
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,579
yeah.

366
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,972
Dan Ott: Do you have I mean, I
suffer from suffer, I don't know

367
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:59,674
if that stuff is the right word.
But I struggle with the same

368
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,496
thing. And especially before, if
I'm got, you know, fun Virtual

369
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:07,077
Coffee guy bolts, the I went
through long phase years of my

370
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:10,778
career where I was just like, I
don't know, I just did that I

371
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:14,599
just stayed in my little cave,
you know, uncoated and whatever,

372
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,061
I follow people on Twitter,
probably, but I was not like,

373
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:21,942
very active, and I was honestly
kind of comfortable with it, you

374
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:25,585
know, sometimes, and then I do
find that the more that I do,

375
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:29,405
force myself out of my comfort
zone, you know, there's, there's

376
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:32,867
these moments right before,
like, like talking, you know,

377
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:39,029
giving a talk, for instance.
And this was, honestly, for me,

378
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,410
it was much worse, in person,
you know, and I was, I was

379
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:49,680
trying to give talks for my
Meetup group, and would have

380
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,509
these moments, like, shortly
before, where I was very

381
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,970
nervous, and I was just like,
why, why, why, why did I do

382
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:57,150
this? Why did I make this
choice? Like, can I just, I want

383
00:31:53,970 --> 00:32:01,170
to just go back to my cave where
nobody can see me, but

384
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:07,049
afterwards, generally felt
pretty good, you know, glad that

385
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:12,660
I did it. And so that's one
thing I keep looking for is ways

386
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:15,329
to, I don't know, force myself
to do things like that. You

387
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:18,359
know, I don't know if that makes
sense. But like signing up for

388
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:25,559
things before I can think about
it, for instance, you know, you

389
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:32,430
know, things like that. Have you
is, have you had any other out

390
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:38,339
of your comfort zone adventures,
recently, aside from the ones

391
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:38,339
we've covered? Oh,

392
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,839
Courtney Landau: yeah. But like
you said, like, I just keep, you

393
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,779
know, forcing myself the more I
do it, the more the better it

394
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:54,210
gets. But that's why I have to
force myself but the only other

395
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,000
situations where like, recently,
we're just taking interviews

396
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,240
while take phone calls once a
month, just because I know that

397
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:09,539
how that I don't know that I
come across great interviews,

398
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:14,970
just because I'm so nervous and
things like that. So just, I

399
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,319
made a decision to like take,
because now that I've been in

400
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,650
the industry for a little bit,
now the recruiters are reaching

401
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,450
out like crazy on LinkedIn. So
I'll take a call, like once a

402
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,240
week, and that's what I'm trying
to do. Because when I go too

403
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,289
long, without talking to people,
I get worse at it. So and I know

404
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:38,490
that about myself, so. And that
kind of helps. But

405
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:40,619
Dan Ott: that's really great. So
I mean, yeah, so like, that's, I

406
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,660
mean, these aren't practice
interviews you're taking, you

407
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,839
know, these are real. I mean,
they might be the first round or

408
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,210
whatever. But these are real
interviews, you know, that

409
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,410
you're just taking for your own,
you know, your own I don't know,

410
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,470
benefit or whatever. Right.
That's awesome.

411
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,339
Courtney Landau: Um, yeah. I
mean, yeah, they're also like,

412
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,660
if it's not just like, any
random, like, if I'm interested

413
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,550
in hearing more about it, I will
reach out but yeah, totally.

414
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,889
It's more perfect. I like where
I'm at right now. But also, we

415
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,369
are very new, and we don't have,
you know, a lot of money coming

416
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:22,800
in. So it's kind of assurance to
to keep up my skills.

417
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:26,639
Dan Ott: Totally. Well, and
I've, you know, I've heard from

418
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,489
other people that like this,
that interviewing is is like,

419
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,949
honestly, just a separate skill
that is worth practicing. And I

420
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,110
just think I think it's very
cool that you do it sort of

421
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,409
intentionally like that, even
when there's not a need. Seems

422
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,469
like the right time to practice
is when what is that an

423
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,309
emergency? Right? Right. Yeah.
That's really, really cool.

424
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,389
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: You, you've
given two lightning talks. So

425
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,159
we've had two lightning talk
events, and you've given talks

426
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,300
in both of them, which were
fantastic like you do. Such a

427
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,050
good job like communicating
things through and going

428
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,440
through, you know, the things
that you're working on. And I

429
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,670
find like, I give talks, but I
am terrified, pretty much the

430
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,840
entire time. And then wonder why
I have agreed to do this. But

431
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,409
like, Are you comfortable? You
look comfortable when you're

432
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,530
doing it? Or is this Oh, are you
pushing yourself out of your

433
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,090
comfort zone in those things?

434
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,739
Courtney Landau: Oh, I'm totally
pushing. But the lightning talks

435
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:34,889
are nice, because I can I mean,
you know, I did a traditional

436
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:41,280
kind of college route. So I
have, like, if you hired

437
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,889
occasionally, you're giving
presentations constantly, at

438
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:48,900
least with my masters. I was. So
I've done it before. And I found

439
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,670
really just having, like, tons
of preparation and practice. I

440
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,349
practice like so many times
beforehand, because if I don't,

441
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:02,670
then I get, you know, also, I
have to know exactly what I'm

442
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:08,429
going to say. So I don't like
lose, you know, my thoughts. So

443
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,250
I don't know. Yeah. I am
surprised to hear you say that

444
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,510
back up. Because I mean, you did
say that. I've done well before,

445
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,300
you know, in my lightning talks,
but I can't go back and listen

446
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,650
to them. Because I just feel my
nervousness all over again. I

447
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,719
know that I should to improve,
but

448
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,579
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: it's so
hard. Oh, for sure. I mean, I

449
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,690
don't like listening to myself
talk or like, let alone going

450
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,429
back. And like watching a video
of myself talking. I am given a

451
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,719
talk next week. And the last
time I gave a version of this

452
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,199
talk, I like cried on camera for
10 minutes. And I was telling my

453
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,599
friend Oh, yeah, I'm doing this
talk. And she's like, Is that

454
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,039
the same one that you cried? And
you're gonna do it again? Well,

455
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,309
yeah, I didn't I didn't really
think about it that way. But now

456
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:04,500
I will. But I think it is like
that practice. And then also

457
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,360
realizing that sometimes you can
practice and things are still

458
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,449
aren't going to happen the way
that maybe you hoped. And then

459
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:15,119
it's just kind of figuring out
like, how do you push through

460
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,989
that when you've got a roomful
of people staring at you or

461
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:19,650
whatever.

462
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,750
Courtney Landau: Right. Yeah.
And also, the topics I'm taking

463
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,039
are very, like, some things I'm
very familiar with, like I know

464
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:38,010
pretty well that I'd be afraid
to, like, do a topic on

465
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,280
something that I've been using
for just like a practice project

466
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,179
or something. I don't know.

467
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:45,570
Unknown: I don't know. I just,

468
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,869
Courtney Landau: if I really
know what I'm talking about. I

469
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,900
feel like I could what you're
talking about Bekah? Yeah,

470
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,130
that'd be really hard for me.

471
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Well, I
think that's good advice. No,

472
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,599
something that note, well,
especially if it's out of your

473
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,079
comfort zone, or if you're doing
something for the first time,

474
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,280
like, find a topic that you're
comfortable talking about,

475
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,360
because then that can offset
some of that discomfort in

476
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,679
trying something new.

477
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,389
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's, that kind
of goes along with my, I'm

478
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:25,949
working on these, like, I didn't
need to come up with the name of

479
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:30,239
them. But like, these pieces of
advice, you know, for different

480
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,440
situations, right. And like
that, trying to not do something

481
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,199
new, like too many new things
all at the same time. You know,

482
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,170
it's like, that's, that's a
danger zone. Right? So, if

483
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,369
you're, like, just getting into
speaking, right, it's just like,

484
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,860
when he was saying, like, pick,
choose something you're

485
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,139
comfortable speaking about,
right? And then once you get

486
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:52,440
like, I feel like the talks, you
see sometimes where somebody

487
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:55,980
learns, like, is presenting
something that they just learned

488
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,309
about or whatever, that stems
are seasoned, you know,

489
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:06,449
speakers, right. Right. So where
they're like, okay, the the

490
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:09,389
thing that they don't know, is
just that tech or whatever, and

491
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:13,469
not, you know, not being
comfortable with what speaking.

492
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,210
I do the same thing. You know,
I've done the same thing, that

493
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,940
the times that I've done. The
lightning talks and stuff is it,

494
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,539
it's nice Also, if you get off
track, or something you at

495
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,829
least, like, if you're if you
know, you know the topic, you

496
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,949
can kind of usually find your
way back. Right.

497
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,139
Courtney Landau: Yeah. And
another thing is, yeah, I like

498
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:44,219
when you're talking about so I
kind of think I could only talk

499
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,719
about like technical things. I
don't know if I would be able to

500
00:39:50,278 --> 00:39:55,318
talk about more things that
weren't like with the technical

501
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,358
talk, it's kind of more you're,
you know, you're kind of going

502
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,849
through steps. So I find that
easier.

503
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:05,940
Dan Ott: Yeah, well, I mean, and
there's lots lots and lots of

504
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,530
value in the, like technical
talks, you know? And have you

505
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,989
found like, in your experience
with, you know, the talks or

506
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,760
whatever, that you've written,
that they've actually helped

507
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,570
you. I don't learn anything new,
or reframe anything for

508
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,829
yourself, you know, even though
you, like, we're, you know,

509
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,380
talking about a topic that you,
you know, sensibly, like, knew

510
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:28,860
pretty well.

511
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:35,400
Courtney Landau: Um, yeah, I
think that there's value in

512
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,119
that, because you have to cover
the topic. When you're giving

513
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,789
the talk, like, you want to
cover all aspects of it? And if

514
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:47,579
it's something I haven't, you
know, there's certain parts of

515
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:53,219
it that I haven't really used in
depth that really helps solidify

516
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,630
things. Yeah,

517
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,920
Dan Ott: yeah, I've had that
experience where this was, I

518
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,929
guess, this was for that the
last round of lightning talks, I

519
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:06,539
talked about CSS Grid, and I
picked it because I like knew it

520
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,179
pretty well, you know, and,
like, grammie grid is like, kind

521
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:14,219
of, I say, knew pretty well. And
that means like, I only had to

522
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,239
look up half of the things that
I was trying to do. But like, I

523
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,639
honestly, like, had a whole
thing wrong in my head that I

524
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,190
was going to talk about, you
know, and I had, like, read it

525
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,849
out incorrectly, and went to
just reference the docs just so

526
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,639
I could like, nail down one
piece of syntax and realize that

527
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,909
I had this whole thing that I
learned it, you know, what I

528
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:36,059
mean? Like, like, in preparing
for the talk, I was like,

529
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,210
actually, like, improve my own,
you know, knowledge at the same

530
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:45,389
time as it was kind of cool. I
was just like, you know, and

531
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:48,119
writing is I think that kind of
the same way, except maybe with

532
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,820
some less pressure, but like,
the the act of like, teaching,

533
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,480
you know, in some way can is
like a very valuable, like

534
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,750
learning tool for yourself,
right? That's the way I look at

535
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,170
it at least.

536
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,800
Courtney Landau: Yeah,
definitely. There's definitely a

537
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,210
lot of value for. And I admire
people that are making blog

538
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,909
posts about things a lot. And I
just don't know how people find

539
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:20,789
that time. I wish I could do
more of that. But yeah, it's

540
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,710
very time consuming, but you do.
It does really solidify your

541
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,269
knowledge. For sure.

542
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,230
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I know, you
know, it's a strategy even in

543
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,190
teaching, like if you're in a
classroom to put a student who

544
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,190
might be a little bit ahead of
another student together and

545
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,019
have them pair. No, I'm not even
on coding things, but just, you

546
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,389
know, whatever topic you're
learning about, because there's

547
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:51,360
something about that peer to
peer interaction, and the, how

548
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,599
you're able to solidify your own
understanding of a concept. But

549
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,500
how teaching it and working
together helps students retain

550
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,920
information better and to grow.
And I think, you know, a lot of

551
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,619
it has to do with like that
sense of accomplishment and

552
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,530
teamwork. And I don't know, I
think that's one of the great

553
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,230
things about Virtual Coffee,
because people are always kind

554
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,219
of pairing up to work on things
together. And, you know, with

555
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:24,929
the mentoring you've done to
Courtney, maybe you've had that

556
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:28,199
experience as well. But you
know, the idea of, you know,

557
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:37,860
pairing with people who you
talked earlier about being able

558
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,769
to offer something, even if
you're a little bit ahead of

559
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:43,320
someone else. And I just think
that's so important. I don't

560
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,579
think that people realize that
enough that you if you're a step

561
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,369
ahead of somebody, you can still
teach and mentor.

562
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,769
Courtney Landau: Right? Yeah,
and definitely

563
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:03,010
mentoring and, like doing the
Oktoberg mentoring is definitely

564
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:09,010
helps solidify my knowledge as
well. And I really enjoy it.

565
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:15,210
Like, I like
talking to people about tech. So

566
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:18,690
I hope to continue doing that.
throughout the rest of my career.

567
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:26,159
Dan Ott: I feel like one of the
nice things about nice, but like

568
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,079
one of the most one of the
important things about mentoring

569
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,510
is like showing that it's okay
to like, not know, everything,

570
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:36,510
you know, and you can be like
successful at whatever project

571
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,280
or task you know, without like
having the complete knowledge of

572
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,869
all things, you know, which is
one of the hardest, like, I feel

573
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:48,929
like one of the hardest things
about learning to be a developer

574
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:57,059
and learning new, new skills is
is just like you it's very

575
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,840
natural to feel like you need to
know everything, you know Yeah,

576
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,550
but like very obvious, like,

577
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,070
Courtney Landau: yeah, that is
impossible.

578
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:07,500
Dan Ott: Right? It's impossible.
No, you're fine. I was just

579
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,780
gonna say it's it's like, it can
seem like everybody that's

580
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,010
experienced does know
everything, you know. And that's

581
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:24,179
like a lesson we try to I don't
know display is even people who

582
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,579
have been working in the
industry for a very long time.

583
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:30,449
Don't know everything, no don't
know nearly everything, you know

584
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:32,550
what I mean? They they've just
like gotten better at finding

585
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:36,960
things out, you know faster,
like lots of times. So it's just

586
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,869
like learning things together is
a great like mentor mentee you

587
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:43,380
know, activity for lack of a
better word.

588
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,579
Unknown: Yeah, definitely. And

589
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,530
Courtney Landau: they,
especially Andrea for

590
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:59,639
HacktoberFest, she
definitely saw a lot of that I

591
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:04,650
wasn't familiar with because we
worked on the Virtual Coffee

592
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:10,170
site itself. And I wasn't
familiar with, like, the static

593
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:14,789
site generator. I hadn't really
used that before. And we use

594
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:21,630
eleventy. And so I was learning
along with her. But yeah, it was

595
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:26,250
really, it was great. And she
actually, I steal her story, but

596
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:34,170
she taught me I knew she'd
definitely taught me things cuz

597
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:37,380
she, she was committing a fight
like a half of not the entire

598
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:40,320
file. Like I've just always just
committed that entire file, but

599
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:43,980
she's on how you can stage just
selection and selected parts.

600
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:52,440
She I think she was very happy
that she got to show me

601
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:56,670
something. Yeah, just she has a
good experience. And yeah, we

602
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:00,000
went mentoring with me will see
me googling and and it's very

603
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:03,179
valuable to show how you go
through your process to like,

604
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,900
and it definitely gets better
over time of how to figure

605
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:10,710
things out, just working
through. Because I mean, web dev

606
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,710
is constantly changing anyway.

607
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,269
Dan Ott: Yes, exactly. Yeah,
that's, that's really awesome.

608
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:19,230
I, I feel like, Oh, no, I can't
speak for Andrew. But like,

609
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,289
being in that position, I almost
would would rather that

610
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:28,409
experience of like, my, like a
mentor, like not, not being the

611
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:30,300
total expert, and just having
all the answers, right, you

612
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,940
know, because that like learning
how to figure things out is,

613
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:36,960
right, it's just like, the most
important thing I feel like to

614
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:39,210
get under your belt, especially
early.

615
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,289
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
want to, I want to say too, so

616
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,179
you did do the lightning talks,
you have mentored, you know,

617
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:55,500
take for some of our coffees.
And this last time for the

618
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,760
lightning talks, you also were a
coordinator, which meant that

619
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,340
you worked with a bunch of
different speakers, and you work

620
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:08,130
with us to kind of create this
process or to understand the

621
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:14,880
process that to create these
events. And that is a lot of

622
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,679
stuff to be doing. And you did
it all really well. You had so

623
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,920
many people that you were
working with to coordinate that

624
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,820
while you were writing your own
talk. Um, do you think like

625
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,659
maybe some of the stuff that
you're doing with Project

626
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:37,050
Management at your job came into
play here? Or you just decided

627
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,340
you are going to do it off?

628
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:45,030
Courtney Landau: Um, no, for
sure. Yeah. Definitely have to

629
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:51,630
do I like working on I like
doing stuff that like helping

630
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,949
out where I can, you know, and
doing that back end like stuff

631
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:59,400
is like, right up my alley.
Like, by like, doing the

632
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,099
coordinating type things. I was
always kind of one of those

633
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,860
people who aren't here's to be
like, oh,

634
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,579
like Vice President, the one who
doesn't have to do everything.

635
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,300
Know of clubs and things. But
yeah, so yeah, like doing that

636
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:24,510
kind of thing. Coordinating was
not hard. It was just reaching

637
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,880
out to people every once a while
wasn't Yeah, it wasn't a big

638
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,199
deal. And my own talk was
something that, you know, I was

639
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,449
pretty familiar with, so I
didn't really have to spend a

640
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:37,230
ton of time. Now you notice I
didn't haven't done like a brown

641
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,500
bag. Right? That that involves a
lot of work, I think like to

642
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,389
speak for an hour, but

643
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,579
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: so that's
what you're gonna do next. Is

644
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,420
that what you're saying?

645
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:48,119
Courtney Landau: I don't know
about that.

646
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,340
Dan Ott: What's your brown bag
topic? Gonna be?

647
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,059
Courtney Landau: Yeah, that's I
that's the question though. I

648
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:54,750
have no idea.

649
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,010
Dan Ott: I mean,

650
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:57,420
Courtney Landau: I probably will.

651
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,789
Dan Ott: There's lots of options
though. With the brown bag to

652
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,280
eat. You know, they don't always
have to be just like,

653
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:06,929
presentation for an hour, you
know, can be like, even with

654
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:10,619
Firebase, you know, mix in some
workshop II stuff or whatever.

655
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,480
There's like, there's lots of
options.

656
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,300
Courtney Landau: Yeah. All
right. Yeah, that's me. I would

657
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,260
really like I think that's more
up my alley than an hour long

658
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,510
talk is more of a workshop
personally.

659
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,960
Dan Ott: Interesting, I think in
general, anyway, maybe not more

660
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,780
interesting. But I always I very
much enjoy workshops, because

661
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,710
it's fun to like work along, you
know, alongside. Yeah,

662
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,130
Courtney Landau: yeah. I mean, a
bit of a tangent, but the code,

663
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:40,050
was it. Like DEV.to's, dot com
or the code newbies conference,

664
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,530
that workshop? those workshops.
were really good. I really

665
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,559
enjoyed those. Nice. That was
definitely the best part of the

666
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,230
conference for me. Yep, so VC.
Next step, we should do

667
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,699
workshops.

668
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,539
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We've had
one workshop. At the beginning

669
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,920
of the year, this year, we're
hot did one. And that was really

670
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,849
great. I would love to see more
workshops. I think that's

671
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:12,500
intimidating. I don't know, I I
feel like I could never give a

672
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,760
workshop. I would be intimidated
by that. But we should

673
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,750
definitely get your workshop
started Courtney.

674
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:26,329
Courtney Landau: Okay.
Yeah, no, I don't know why. But

675
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,250
I like that. I like teaching
things like that. I think that.

676
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:35,090
For me, my comfort level was
more geared towards that kind of

677
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,599
thing, then talking on stage, or
would it not really on stage,

678
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,699
but you know, for an hour?

679
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:45,050
Dan Ott: Yeah, I feel the same
way I feel I very much enjoy,

680
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,130
like, especially even want a one
on one, you know, like

681
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,420
conversations, but anything
where it's, the closer it is to

682
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,440
having conversation, as opposed
to you know, like you said, like

683
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,199
standing on a huge stage or
whatever, you know, I don't

684
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:03,260
know, the easier it is for me to
get into it and feel less

685
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,280
nervous about it anyway.

686
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:09,050
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So we've
talked a lot about the things

687
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,349
that you've done to kind of push
yourself out of your comfort

688
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,780
zone and your journey. And I
don't know if you have a recent

689
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,800
win that you want to share. But
if you do, we would love to hear

690
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,010
it.

691
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,889
Courtney Landau: Let me think
for a second. Probably like, a

692
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:35,630
month ago now or not sure. But I
had for work I had designed and

693
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,400
built. We I mentioned the Chrome
extension we had for students,

694
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,250
but I designed and built one for
teachers as well, to solve a

695
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,630
need that they saw that works
with Google Classroom. But um,

696
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:57,500
yeah, so that came out like,
couple weeks ago, and I got some

697
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,530
really good feedback on that.
And everybody seems to really

698
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,599
like it. So that's a win for me.

699
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:04,340
Dan Ott: That's awesome. That's
a huge win.

700
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,329
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, it is.

701
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:12,469
Dan Ott: I've never messed with
Chrome extensions. Are they

702
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:18,320
like, is it JavaScript? Yep.
Yes, it's just like a, like a

703
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,550
whole nother world. Like, just
if you know, JavaScript, are you

704
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,920
still gonna just be totally lost
until you learn it? Or is it

705
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,119
like, you know,

706
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,539
Courtney Landau: it depends on
what you want to do. I guess

707
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:33,260
it's really, like, there's a pop
up part that's just, you know,

708
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,820
styling, HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript there. But then

709
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,079
there's like things that you can
do within, like, use Google

710
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,300
Chrome, API's to like, inject
things into the page, like,

711
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,860
websites or grab things from
them. And then there's the

712
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,219
background that's does a bunch
of stuff. But that's Yeah, and

713
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:59,840
that's just JavaScript too. So,
yeah, totally depends on there's

714
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,329
it, there's a million different
things you could do with the

715
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:03,380
Chrome extension. But

716
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,389
Dan Ott: that's, that's a whole
area I've never I've never

717
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:11,989
messed with, but it always
seemed like, could be some, you

718
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:13,849
know, possible to make some cool
stuff, you know,

719
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:15,289
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Could be a
workshop.

720
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:16,219
Dan Ott: Yeah. Could be.

721
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,530
Courtney Landau: I could do a
workshop on that.

722
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:21,769
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That would
be awesome.

723
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,369
Dan Ott: I'd go.

724
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,889
Courtney Landau: I don't know
how, yeah. How many people want

725
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,659
to build Chrome extensions, but

726
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,019
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I mean, I
think it's cool. Everybody in

727
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,480
the community is always
interested in something, you

728
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,050
know, there's enough people here
that they just want to hear

729
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:41,989
whether they want to do it or
just want to have some

730
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:45,800
understanding of it. I think
that you know, there are always

731
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,039
people there that are going to
support the talk or the workshop.

732
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,949
Courtney Landau: That's Yeah,
that's really true. Because

733
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:55,610
there's always a lot of people
that I go to as many brown bags

734
00:54:55,610 --> 00:55:00,170
as I can, even if I'm not as
interested in the topic, It

735
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:02,329
always proves valuable some way,

736
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,780
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: for sure.
All right, Courtney, this has

737
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,710
been really great. And it was
nice to talk through all of

738
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,260
these things with you and kind
of hear your stories behind

739
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,909
