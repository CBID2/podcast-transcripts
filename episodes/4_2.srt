00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:09,223
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season four, episode two of the

2
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:13,461
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,452
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:20,301
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,271
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:26,512
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,692
you here with me. Today is my
cohost Dan.

8
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:34,325
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today we're
joined by Todd Libby. Todd is a

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,804
web developer designer and
accessibility advocate. And he's

10
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:41,104
been doing it for over 20 years.
He's currently an accessibility

11
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,225
engineer at WebstaurantStore. And
he's also a member of the

12
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:49,024
worldwide web consortium. Also
known as W3C, doing work updating

13
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,104
their web content accessibility
guidelines. Todd also hosts a

14
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,804
podcast called the Front End
Nerdery, so once you're done

15
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:58,125
listening to this episode, head
over there and give that one a

16
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,445
listen. We had a great time
talking with Todd and hearing

17
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:04,234
about his long journey in tech,
how and why he developed a career

18
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:07,685
focusing on accessibility and
shared with us about what

19
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,685
accessibility means to him and
what kinds of things all

20
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:14,944
developers can do to ensure their
work is accessible by everyone. I

21
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:15,905
know you're going to enjoy it.

22
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,676
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

23
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:30,605
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

24
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:34,796
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. Today's

25
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:40,215
question is what famous artist,
dead or alive, or you want to

26
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:45,813
paint your portrait. We hope you
enjoy this episode. name is

27
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:53,338
Bekah. I am a front end developer
from a small town in Ohio, and if

28
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,509
I could have one person paint my
portrait, I, when I was in

29
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,769
college, Georgia, there was like
big Georgia O'Keeffe paintings or

30
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,478
replicas in the hallways of my
department. And I always loved

31
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,808
them. I know that's not what she
doesn't paint people, but I think

32
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:16,038
it would be cool to see how I
would be represented by her. So

33
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,329
I'm going to go with Georgia
O'Keeffe

34
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:24,003
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan I'm a front
end developer in Cleveland, Ohio,

35
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,693
and, um, does it have to be
famous person?

36
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:28,463
Bekah: Did I say famous?

37
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,403
Dan: I, it said famous in the
question.

38
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,968
Bekah: I did. but now like just
take it out.

39
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:35,433
Dan: I mean, uh, Kate, one of my
good friends at Kate Brideau from

40
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:39,033
college, um, I would say that
would be the person. Um, that'd

41
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,213
be famous. I don't, I don't
really know a lot of famous

42
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,663
names. I mean, except for like
the really famous ones, you know,

43
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:50,503
and that seems like a boring
answer. Um, maybe have Raphael,

44
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,743
but not the, not the artist that
ninja turtle.

45
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,204
Bekah: Or my

46
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:58,644
Dan: Yeah. Well it's well, sure.
There's there's that too. Yeah.

47
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:02,204
Any Raphael really? I'll take,
uh, take any version. Sounds like

48
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:02,743
a good choice.

49
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:09,818
Todd: And I'm Todd Libby. I am a
front end developer and

50
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:15,968
accessibility engineer currently
in Phoenix, Arizona. And I guess

51
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,429
my artist would be, I dunno, he
was really unique. So I guess I

52
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,868
would say Salvador Dali.

53
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,519
Bekah: That's cool.

54
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,258
Dan: That'd be a good one.

55
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,258
Bekah: There's um, anytime
somebody is from Phoenix, I think

56
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:38,278
of a short story that I read from
Sherman Alexie. This is what it

57
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:41,998
means to say Phoenix, Arizona.
And I remember nothing about the

58
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:45,239
short story except for the title.
And it's just automatically,

59
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,679
that's my mind. So if you
haven't, read it, check it out

60
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,179
and then remind me what it was
about.

61
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,028
Todd: I haven't, but I will look
that up. Definitely. I'm

62
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,688
originally from Portland Maine.
So of course everybody knows me

63
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,549
because of the lobster roll
thing. So.

64
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:05,514
Bekah: Yes, Todd is all about the
lobsters and in our Virtual

65
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,883
Coffee Slack, he always uses the
lobster emoji to respond to

66
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,334
people. And so we just
automatically recognize that it's

67
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:18,444
Todd. So it's like he, he has
claimed that emoji and it's one

68
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,553
of the greatest things ever.

69
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,803
Dan: It's really cool. And it's
just like, you see the lobster

70
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,394
emoji pop up. You're like, oh,
cool. Todd's here.

71
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:30,418
Bekah: I just think it's it's
funny, like when, when new people

72
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,538
come into Virtual Coffee and then
they also click the lobster

73
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,069
emoji. So.

74
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,749
Dan: I mean I always click it. I
mean, I don't first, you know

75
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:39,178
what I mean? But like, um, it's,
it's like high five and Todd, you

76
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,559
know, it's like celebrating the
Toddness of it.

77
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,343
Todd: the virtual virtual high
five,

78
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:47,459
Dan: That's right.

79
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,119
Bekah: Right. And it can be about
all sorts of different things.

80
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,629
Like somebody could post a
question that they have, and then

81
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,869
like, there's a lobster emoji.
It's not about lobster. Although

82
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,059
if I had a question about
lobster, I would definitely ask

83
00:04:59,059 --> 00:04:59,658
Todd first.

84
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,494
Todd: I've got a million no one
answers.

85
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,048
Bekah: I feel like that's a
separate podcast episode.

86
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:08,168
Todd: Yes.

87
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,189
Dan: Does it have to be though?

88
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,968
Bekah: Thank you so much for
being here with us. Todd, we

89
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:18,559
always like to start with the
origin story. How did you get to

90
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:22,218
where you are today? So if you.
want to take us through that path

91
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:22,488
would be.

92
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,173
Todd: Yeah. Oh boy. That's a long
one. Um, I'll give you the

93
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:32,824
abridged version. I'm nine years
old. I started on a Commodore

94
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:38,463
PET. Um, in school and then
gradually worked my way up to a

95
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,233
Commodore 64, where I learned
BASIC a lot of different flavors

96
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:50,343
of BASIC, um, and was just, you
know, it was just a hobby of

97
00:05:50,343 --> 00:06:01,264
course at that point. But, um,
what was it about 1999? Um, I had

98
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:09,139
a. What was it? A 386 desktop,
IBM computer. And I started to

99
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:15,168
learn HTML and this was before
CSS. So that is the indication of

100
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:23,178
how old I am and JavaScript was
just kicking around. Um, I

101
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:27,468
started learning how to design
websites using Front Page Express

102
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:35,103
in Internet Explorer, three and
four. And just, it went from

103
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:44,733
there. Um, programming was cool.
I used to do, um, in BASIC on a

104
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:49,564
Commodore I would program. If
anybody remembers those, choose

105
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,454
your own adventure books from way
back in the day. I, I used to

106
00:06:54,454 --> 00:07:01,863
program a text-based, uh, Pretty
much copied and I hope no one's

107
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:08,014
listening from that company, but,
um, I, I used to, just to just

108
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:13,399
practice, I would just. Code
those books into a, into a

109
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,468
text-based game on Commodore 64.
And that's really what got me

110
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,249
started because I was living in a
very rural area in, in New

111
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:28,009
England. And, uh, there wasn't
much to do so except for

112
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,488
programming at that point. So
skip ahead to today, or when I

113
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:40,548
started professionally and I was
22 years ago. And I started, um,

114
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:44,689
I read Jeffrey Zeldman his book,
Designing with Web Standards

115
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:49,788
instantly got hooked into web
standards, uh, progressive

116
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:54,288
enhancement accessibility. And it
just, you know, took off to the

117
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:59,449
point where it is today, where
I'm in the field that I enjoy

118
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,478
being in, and that's
accessibility.

119
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,298
Dan: I think that's awesome. I,
and I, I love that book too. And

120
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:14,829
Zeldman I have been, um, so 22
years ago what, 99, 2000

121
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,478
something like that, know? And I
think I got into, I mean, I was

122
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,019
starting to make something around
then and really. Got a lot more

123
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,588
into it a couple of years later.
Um, but was with the web

124
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,838
standards, you know, movement and
everything like that. And I've

125
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:34,068
been, uh, you know, and similarly
front-end focused for a long

126
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,859
time. And, um, one of us was just
one of the reasons I was very

127
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:41,028
excited to have you podcast and
to kind of get to get to hang out

128
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,288
with a little bit more. Um,

129
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:42,438
Todd: Yeah.

130
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,428
Dan: It's uh, so, know, on front
end and focusing on

131
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,303
accessibility, um, things like
that. I mean, what career

132
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,313
opportunities has that like
presented you from, you know,

133
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,073
starting, you don't need to like
list every single one or

134
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,433
whatever, but like run, run us
through a little bit of how

135
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:06,333
that's been being like, uh, front
end and accessibility, you know,

136
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:11,104
a specialist, um, for whatever
that means for you. Uh, you know,

137
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,203
run it through a little bit, like
how that's been finding, finding

138
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:16,203
work and finding people that care
about that sort of thing. Um,

139
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:20,259
Bekah: Can I just jump into, if
you can just provide some context

140
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,269
for what, what does accessibility
mean and how does that work as

141
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,048
part of a job?

142
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:33,109
Todd: Okay. Um, to address what
it's accessibility mean, uh, I'll

143
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:38,708
address that first and that is
making the web equal and

144
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,634
accessible for everybody. Um, it
just doesn't have to be a

145
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:47,344
disability. It can be, you know,
somebody in I'll use this example

146
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:53,854
in a very rural area who has a 3g
phone. And, you know, it's not a

147
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,484
very fast connection is to, you
know, what we have these days

148
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:04,714
with our shiny new iPhones and
stuff like that. Um, and then

149
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:10,188
accessibility. Somebody in
accessibility would basically,

150
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,038
um, not only advocate, but don't
in my daily routine of doing

151
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:22,639
auditing on websites. It's just
checking to see if, uh, Sites are

152
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,619
accessible if they're, you know,
if they should be failing, um,

153
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,239
web content, accessibility
guidelines WCAG is how I

154
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,389
pronounce it. There's many
different pronunciations to that,

155
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:46,489
but, um, um, the, um, you know,
and you know, there's different,

156
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:54,749
I guess. Levels of how people
will do an audit. Like, you know,

157
00:10:55,558 --> 00:11:00,538
you can do, you know, a and AA as
far as the levels. So there's a

158
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:06,058
AA and AAA, a lot of people I
find don't do AAA, because it's

159
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:11,129
too stringent and it's also, you
don't have to go that far in most

160
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:17,224
cases. Um, but. It's just
auditing, making sure sites are

161
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:22,984
accessible in, um, creating a
report for a client and then

162
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:27,153
telling them here's what's wrong.
Here's how you need to fix it.

163
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:32,553
This doesn't, you know, adhere to
the guidelines and, um,

164
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,803
recommendations for best
practices as well. And, um, You

165
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,953
know, looking at code and, you
know, always looking at HTML and

166
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:46,594
CSS because CSS too has a strong
effect on accessibility and, uh,

167
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:51,464
that's what the job entails. Um,
and Dan, what was your question?

168
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,558
Dan: Alright, I guess my question
was, um, you know, it's, it's a

169
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,568
sort of. I don't know if
non-traditional is the right

170
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:01,019
word, but, you know, being a
specialist really in any regard,

171
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,249
um, is, uh, is a choice, you
know, and can limit your options,

172
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,208
but like also what you want to
do. Right. Um, and so I, my

173
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,048
question was more like, how has
it been, uh, on your career

174
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,568
journey? You know, being a
specialist, especially in the

175
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,948
accessibility world,

176
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,543
Todd: Right. Um, it's been a
challenge lately in, I would say

177
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:30,793
the past. Five, maybe 10 years.
Um, because not a lot of people,

178
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,464
not a lot of companies were
looking for accessibility

179
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:39,764
specialists. Um, not until I've
pretty much noticed this year. A

180
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:43,333
lot of companies are now looking
for accessibility specialists

181
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,668
because companies are getting
sued. And they don't want to get

182
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:53,908
sued. That's that's the bottom
line. So my professional journey

183
00:12:53,908 --> 00:13:00,239
had been, I worked, uh, I
started, I did a website for

184
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:07,769
somebody I knew back in, uh, new
England, Maine. And, um, it was

185
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,808
just a small. And then from there
I got, you know, a few different

186
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,859
jobs doing websites. And then
from there I was like, well, you

187
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:20,729
know, this thing's taken off. I'm
going to do the I'm going to go

188
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:31,903
the freelance route. So that's
what I did. And. Up until 2015, I

189
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:36,644
was a freelance, uh, developer, I
guess you could say I got into

190
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:42,313
WordPress, uh, PHP development.
And then, um, I was hired by a

191
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:51,403
company to do their website and
their SAS, um, their SAS, uh,

192
00:13:52,663 --> 00:14:01,124
site, I guess. It was a, a thing
where you log in and it wasn't a

193
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:12,043
public facing site. And, um, from
there it would be been about, I

194
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:16,693
don't know. I think I counted
over 2000 resumes that I had sent

195
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:23,323
out to companies in 20 years in.
One company hired me. And that

196
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:28,994
was that company that I worked
for in 2015 to, uh, just, uh,

197
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:34,033
last year as a matter of fact.
And then finally somebody took a

198
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,823
chance on me that would have been
Nobility. I was hired by

199
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:43,903
Nobility, uh, in March and March
or April. Geez, it's been over

200
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,033
six months, but, um,

201
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,818
Dan: What is time anyway.

202
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:51,359
Todd: well, I don't even know
anymore. I'm in a different time

203
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:57,928
zone now, so that's messed me up
too. Uh, but no ability gave me

204
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:02,458
a, you know, an opportunity and
very grateful for that

205
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:09,178
opportunity with them and, um, a
lot of great people in Nobility

206
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:15,269
that work for the company. Um,
everybody is a matter of fact and

207
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:19,859
they do some really good stuff as
far as accessibility goes. And,

208
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:28,336
um, as of October 1st, I will be,
um, on the, uh, WebstaurantStore

209
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:32,677
team as an accessibility
engineer. Uh, so I look forward

210
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,366
to that. Yeah.

211
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,506
Bekah: Can you talk a little bit
about what you'll be doing in

212
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,756
that role there? Maybe dive into
a little bit of detail.

213
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,251
Todd: Um, for right now, all I
know is it's basically doing the

214
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:52,192
same thing I do now and that's
auditing, um, their product for

215
00:15:52,192 --> 00:16:04,251
their, uh, website. I know they
use, they use react and I think

216
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:10,042
it was .net. So that I'll be in
that, um, environment.

217
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,182
Bekah: So like when you do an
audit, where do you start with

218
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:13,272
that?

219
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:21,471
Todd: So when I do an audit, I do
automated, uh, checks and scans

220
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:27,772
first. So I use stuff like the
WAVE extension, um, the axe, I

221
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:32,601
now wait until the end to use the
axe-core extension in the

222
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:40,297
browser. Um, Things like, uh,
there's a command line called

223
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:48,726
Pa11y. So it's PA one, one Y uh,
there's that I use, um, does

224
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:55,057
Bookmarklets from Ian Lloyd and
Paul J. Adam that I use to also

225
00:16:55,326 --> 00:17:01,206
do checks. Um, Let's see what
else? There's Microsoft

226
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:07,267
Accessibility Insights, which is
a great tool to use. Um, what

227
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:15,517
else? And I said, axe, color,
contrast checks. I use, um, the

228
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,626
Firefox accessibility dev tools,
the accessibility panels and

229
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:26,196
those, and then I move on to, um,
manual testing. So. mouse only,

230
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:33,112
um, keyboard only I will do it,
which goes back to color

231
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,842
contrast. I'll do the squint
test. So I'll just look at the

232
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:39,352
site while I'm squinting at it
and see if, you know, I can make

233
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:45,951
out anything cause that I was
taught not too long ago. So, um,

234
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:52,701
and uh, screen readers, I will
use screen readers. So for Mac

235
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:58,192
there's Voiceover. And it's best
to use Voiceover in Safari

236
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:05,152
because the native, you know, Mac
app and everything, um, and VDA

237
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:14,811
and Jaws on a Windows. And, um,
if, and it's very, very rare, but

238
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:21,067
if somebody says, oh, you know,
we have Linux users. So I will

239
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:27,846
test on what it's called Orca for
Linux and, um, yeah, those are

240
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:34,237
pretty much, uh, if I remember
them all correctly, um, those are

241
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,317
the tools I use.

242
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,366
Dan: That's. Yeah, that's
awesome. It's very extensive. I

243
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,926
was just writing all them down so
that

244
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:42,176
Bekah: So as I well, the link to
those show notes.

245
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:45,801
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And so, so
like day to day, I mean, I know

246
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:49,521
you haven't started yet, but like
in your, in your role, will it be

247
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,541
mostly doing audits after the
fact? Or like, will you be

248
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,211
interfacing with, you know, I'm
not sure what they do, what they,

249
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:59,092
what, what they make or anything
like that, but you know, like

250
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:03,142
where in the process are you, are
you, uh, doing like

251
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,336
accessibility? Uh, you know,
helping the team with, with this

252
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:10,446
stuff, like, know, audits for me
imply, and I know this isn't

253
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,537
always true, but when I think of
it as something, oh, something's

254
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,807
done, now we do an audit on it.
You know what I mean? but I was

255
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,936
wondering if, and I'm sure that's
an important part. I was

256
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:23,196
wondering if there's, um, places
earlier in the process where, um,

257
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:28,386
where, you know, you're able to
interface and like, you know,

258
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,747
make suggestions before it, you
know, as opposed to like fixing

259
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,576
things, but like help build
something you know, the first

260
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:34,666
time.

261
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:34,997
Todd: Right. Yeah,

262
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:35,696
Dan: Does that make sense?

263
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:42,946
Todd: yeah, yeah. Um, I'm, I'm
sure it's going to be probably a

264
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:49,096
lot of both. Um, maybe there's
existing things on the site, uh,

265
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:56,416
that need to be checked, um,
components that may be being

266
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,561
worked on. We'll have to be
checked. I mean, it's that way,

267
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,731
pretty much with any kind of
audit. So I've had companies come

268
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:11,152
to me and say, you know, we we've
got somebody who emailed us and

269
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:16,461
said, this isn't accessible, so
we need a, an audit done and I'll

270
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:20,287
go through the site and say,
okay, I found all this. Here's

271
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:24,757
what you need to do to fix it.
They'll fix it. That'll be after

272
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,146
the fact of course, I've had
companies come in and ask me to

273
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:34,626
do consulting with their teams
before the project starts to make

274
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,567
sure that it gets done
beforehand. Because when you do

275
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,836
an accessibility, when you, when
you bring in accessibility from

276
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:45,146
the start of a project, it's so
much easier and there's less, a

277
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:50,416
lot less stress, doing it from
the very beginning, because when

278
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,957
you get to the end and you've
got, everything is as accessible

279
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:58,336
as you can. And I'll add that
nothing's a hundred percent

280
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:05,537
accessible. Um, it's, it's a lot
easier on your teams. You know,

281
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:08,057
like I said, there's a lot less
stress. You don't have to go back

282
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:13,237
and scatter around trying to fix
this, that, and the other thing

283
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:17,826
after the fact. So, um, and
that's also where my advocacy

284
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:22,086
comes in is saying, okay, if you
get this done from the start,

285
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,616
you're going to be, it's going to
be so much easier and it's going

286
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:31,116
to cost less money because you're
not going to. It's going to cause

287
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:35,406
a lot less stress again. And, uh,
those are the two main things.

288
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:39,126
Um, but to answer the question,
it's going to be a little bit of

289
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:42,366
both. I would think, because like
I said, it's usually that way at

290
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,906
the beginning, you know? Um,

291
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,346
Dan: Get something to a baseline
first.

292
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,807
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and
it's still really early in the

293
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:57,567
process, so I'm not too sure, but
I know that there'll be a lot of,

294
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:03,866
you know, checking to make sure
everything's good. On the end of,

295
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:07,047
you know, before we put this out,
we need to make sure it's

296
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,416
accessible. So. yeah.

297
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,051
Bekah: As you've been working
through this industry, do you

298
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:18,307
think. Is there one problem that
you keep encountering over and

299
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:22,356
over, like stand out issues,
things that people can just

300
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:25,656
really look at and say, all
right, let's start here.

301
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:34,511
Todd: Well, where do I begin?
It's it's a lot, but mainly it's

302
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:42,311
color contrast. Okay. Um, that's
the biggest one. Um, and, uh,

303
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:49,487
Keyboard accessibility is another
and throwing a third one. And

304
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:55,217
that being, uh, alt text on
images, the alternative text, um,

305
00:22:56,537 --> 00:23:07,217
I've had, you know, a lot of alt
text can be a tricky, um, uh, a

306
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:11,747
tricky thing because people
think, well, I have this image.

307
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:19,477
And I need to really go into
detail what that image is

308
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:23,946
conveying. If it's an informative
image and you really don't just a

309
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:31,146
short, you know, it's a purple
flower in a field, um, is fine.

310
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:35,946
You don't have to go into, I've
seen on Twitter because they give

311
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:40,491
you a thousand characters for alt
text. And I've seen this. I've

312
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:41,892
seen alt text that long before.

313
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:45,511
Bekah: I always wonder, like, I,
I don't think I've written enough

314
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,082
because I'm not even close to the
1000 and I have a thousand to

315
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:49,531
write.

316
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,836
Dan: Yeah. I always try to just
like, like, just say the joker. I

317
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:56,086
mean, usually if I'm posting an
image, it's a joke, you know, but

318
00:23:56,086 --> 00:24:00,136
like the shortest version of the
joke is, you know, so I like

319
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,287
posted one today and it was just
like guys saying thumbs up or

320
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,267
something like that, that, you
know, you know what I mean? like

321
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,807
that seems that at least seems
like usually enough. I don't need

322
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:09,436
to give the whole,

323
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,656
Bekah: Sometimes I just don't
post because I don't know how to

324
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,856
describe it. Like, well, I'm not
really sure that I know how to

325
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:19,336
say capture what this is doing,
so we'll go, we'll go for

326
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:19,936
something else.

327
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:24,297
Todd: There's a lot of debate
around how long should it be? It

328
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,116
shouldn't be 180 characters.
Should it be a certain amount of

329
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:31,646
words, but just as long as it
conveys in a short succinct,

330
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:39,086
Sentence, I guess that's fine.
Um, and of course you have some

331
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:43,287
images decorative that, ya know,
it needs an empty all text. And

332
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:47,876
that's a big one because I was
just doing an audit and they had

333
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:53,547
decorative images, but no, alt,
no empty alt text, um, which is

334
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:57,326
just the alt equals, you know,
quotes and it's, the quotes are

335
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:58,346
empty in between,

336
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:01,781
Bekah: Can you explain that?
Cause that I had just recently

337
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:06,892
learned about that, but. Don't
quite understand why that's the

338
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:07,471
standard.

339
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,757
Todd: So there's a, it tells a
screen reader. There's an image

340
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:16,406
there, but it doesn't, it doesn't
need it's decorative basically.

341
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:19,237
So it just there's, there's no
need to, to

342
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:22,426
Dan: ha what happens in a
screenwriter? If it runs into an

343
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:24,257
image with no alt attribute at
all?

344
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:29,797
Todd: Uh, it skips over it. So
you're loo the, the user is

345
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:32,856
losing information. So if there's
something you're trying to

346
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:37,567
convey, like let's use the, um,
like, an infographic, for

347
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:43,326
example, and there's no alt text
on it. That user that's using the

348
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:47,356
screen reader is not gonna know
that it's there.

349
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:52,836
Dan: Totally. Totally. And so in
the case of a decorative image

350
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:56,317
where we don't need. It's okay.
If his screen, you know, if it's

351
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:59,227
okay, if anybody skips over it,
what do you know, what is the

352
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,446
tactical difference for a screen
reader for a user on a screen

353
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:07,326
reader between empty, an image
with an like with a alt property

354
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:12,727
and just an empty string and an
image with alt you know, defined

355
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:13,086
at all.

356
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:24,866
Todd: So. it's okay. Let's use a
logo. As an example, if you have

357
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:31,257
empty alt text on your logo, and
it's also linked, the screen

358
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:39,116
reader will read that link and
you don't want that to read it.

359
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:45,382
You don't want it to. It doesn't
really need to, I mean, there's

360
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:51,352
cases where somebody may say,
yeah, I want the person to know

361
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:56,451
what the logo looks like, but if
it's not really necessary, um, no

362
00:26:56,451 --> 00:27:04,342
alt text, you know, it's the
screen reader. Won't read

363
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:11,646
anything and. As far as I know.
And I'll be the first to say, I'm

364
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:16,326
not an expert by any means with
screen readers, because this is a

365
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:23,346
lot of different stuff. I've been
learning lately, but to mine, to

366
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:30,096
my recollection, anyways, an
empty. So the end. So no alt

367
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:35,872
texts. Let me get this straight.
No, alt text, the URL will be

368
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:37,311
read to the image.

369
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,707
Dan: Okay. Yeah. That's the big
difference. All right. That's the

370
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,126
part, I didn't

371
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:43,321
Todd: Yes. Yup.

372
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:48,547
Dan: no alt text at all, like no,
alt property defined. When a

373
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,797
screen reader is reading it,
it'll come through normal texts

374
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:54,186
and then it'll just read like,
blah, blah, blah dot JPEG. Right.

375
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,686
Okay. That's

376
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,892
Todd: And then the, the empty alt
is silent. So that's.

377
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,422
Dan: it'll that tells it to skip
right over it, which is you want.

378
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:06,442
Sometimes like, sometimes that is
the preferred thing or like the

379
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:09,652
decorative image where it's a
background image or something

380
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:12,832
like that, or, background, but
like, you know, sometimes it's

381
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,872
just used for decoration. Doesn't
need to convey actually

382
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:19,832
information. and so in those
cases, putting an empty, alt like

383
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:24,862
alt equals, you know, empty
string. Is is actually very good

384
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:28,521
and much like very good for
accessibility because otherwise

385
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:32,632
they're going to see probably a
very long URL with dot JPEG,

386
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,311
which means nothing to them.
Right.

387
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:35,491
Todd: Yes. Exactly.

388
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:40,701
Dan: Oh, that's great. Um, that's
one of those things that. And

389
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,541
I've seen a lot of people. This
is a separate topic, like that,

390
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:48,711
that little, like, pick that
little bit, just, just even just

391
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:52,642
Alt getting like your head
wrapped around how to deal with

392
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:56,932
alt, alt texts. Um, like you
said, mix can make a huge

393
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:00,501
difference for accessibility
making a for your users. oh,

394
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,132
that's really cool.

395
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,896
Bekah: And you were talking about
one of the big problems being

396
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,727
color contrast. And that seems
like something that could be

397
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:15,636
pretty simple to identify with a
Lighthouse audit. Um, can you

398
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,606
explain what a Lighthouse audit
is? And if you're like, that's

399
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,787
not the way to go. This other
method is better. Um, I would

400
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:22,207
love to hear that.

401
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:29,711
Todd: So, I mean, I've used
Lighthouse before. I don't really

402
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:34,662
rely on lighthouse. Lighthouse
runs off of axe-core and which is

403
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:42,132
great, but I don't think it
really gets to the root of every

404
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:49,301
issue. And it really can't. Uh,
plus you have false positives,

405
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,692
which is, you know, something,
it, for example, I was just

406
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,932
talking about this on the, in
the, in the Slack, uh, Virtual

407
00:29:55,932 --> 00:30:01,467
Coffee Slack. False positives for
color contrast, you know, I've

408
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:08,007
come across instances where it
will flag color, contrast errors,

409
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:13,676
but the color contrast is far
exceeds the 4.5 to one ratio. So

410
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,767
I don't really rely on
Lighthouse. I mean, it's a good

411
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:20,636
tool. Don't get me wrong because
there's that performance piece to

412
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:30,751
it that I really, really like,
uh, using and, um, As far as, you

413
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:37,852
know, it's a good tool, don't get
me wrong, but I use, and I used

414
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,432
to use it. I used to use it
myself. I mean, I used it on my

415
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,801
site and was like, yeah, one
hundreds. I got one hundreds

416
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,342
across the board and you know,
that, that virtual confetti

417
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:53,471
flying everywhere. But, um, the
tools that I use would be, um,

418
00:30:56,067 --> 00:31:03,356
It's a contrast hyphen ratio.com,
which is Lea Verou, uh, color

419
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:10,076
contrast site. I also use, um,
the, let me look, I have it on my

420
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:15,596
other machine here, the color
contrast analyzer. And that is by

421
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:22,106
The Paciello Group. So Steven
Faulkner has based on the Windows

422
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:26,156
version, the Mac iOS version was
developed by somebody else. Uh, I

423
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:33,926
use that, that tool as well. Um,
and I will provide, uh, the link

424
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:34,497
to that.

425
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,419
Bekah: This great, I'm like
really looking forward, it could

426
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,598
diving into a lot of these
resources that you are dropping

427
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:45,489
right now. Cause I think
sometimes it's hard to know where

428
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:51,068
to start. And, I think that's
just a problem with teaching

429
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:57,398
developers in general. There's
not a focus on it. It's not built

430
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:07,118
into most curriculums and, um, at
all. And so there's a lack of

431
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:11,773
focus, I think, as a result of
that. And then not knowing where

432
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:16,114
to start, or if you're with a
company that doesn't look at

433
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:21,223
those things, then I think it can
be, you can find yourself a while

434
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:27,223
down the path and and not know
what you should be identifying,

435
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,374
how you should be approaching
this. And so the more that we

436
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:35,084
talk about it, I think the
better, um, where do you think

437
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:39,044
people could get started if they
want to learn more about

438
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:39,403
accessible?

439
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:48,663
Todd: So the w three C has a
great, um, intro to accessibility

440
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:52,982
class, which I believe is still
free. And yeah, it's an

441
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:58,853
Introduction to Web Accessibility
on edex.org. And, uh, I took that

442
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:04,048
class even. Um, and it was it's
great. Uh, you can pace yourself.

443
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:09,657
Doesn't have to be real fast is
no, you know, there's no due date

444
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,907
or anything. There's a free
version. If you want a

445
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:17,877
certificate, you got to pay a
certain amount. Um, it's like if

446
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:21,238
you put in four to five hours a
week, it's like for four weeks

447
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:27,373
long, uh, to do. It gives a good
overview of, excuse me,

448
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:34,363
accessibility, and you know, some
of the guidelines there's, um, a

449
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:40,542
lot of good information on the
web, uh, and, uh, even have to

450
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:44,532
pitch Nobility's website and
their blog. They go over some of

451
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:50,337
the, uh, WCAG guidelines and
accessibility is also, I want to

452
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:55,077
make this clear accessibility is
more than just WCAG guidelines.

453
00:33:55,438 --> 00:34:01,647
Um, it's also about inclusive
design as well. Um, making sure,

454
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:07,048
you know, certain demographics
aren't, you know, kept out that,

455
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:12,117
that everybody's included, um,
hence the name inclusive design.

456
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:21,768
Um, but, um, Some other, um,
let's see. That's a good

457
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,797
question. Cause there's so much,
I mean, I guess, you know, a

458
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:31,728
search would come up with a lot
of different things. WebAIM.org

459
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:36,027
has some good stuff. As far as
accessibility, learning

460
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:43,018
accessibility, um, level access
does, uh, let's see who else.

461
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:50,293
TPGI has good stuff. So there's,
there's a lot out there that, you

462
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:54,913
know, people can find on, you
know, even there's even like

463
00:34:54,913 --> 00:35:00,943
courses on, I guess Udemy and
platforms like that as well.

464
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:09,373
Bekah: So, this has kind of been
your focus the entire time you've

465
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:15,373
been working in tech. Was there a
reason that you went down this

466
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:20,382
path or, or something that kind
of inspired this journey? Or have

467
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,463
you just always been interested
in it?

468
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:30,722
Todd: Uh, it started when a
couple of family members, I have

469
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:36,603
like three family members that
have disabilities, um, to have

470
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:45,012
motor skill disabilities, one
visual and. Seeing the looks of

471
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,342
frustration on their faces when
they're trying to access

472
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:52,842
something that's inaccessible on
the web really got me motivated

473
00:35:52,842 --> 00:36:01,362
in the beginning and carries me
to this day. Really. Um, I kind

474
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:08,916
of towards like 2018, 2019 was
kind of like. I guess slacking

475
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:14,347
off a little bit with my
accessibility, but I get together

476
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:20,047
with our friend, Chris DeMars in
Burlington, Vermont. There was a,

477
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:27,811
there was a conference and. You
know, he gave a great talk and

478
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:32,972
that really lit the fire again.
So there's been a really, it's

479
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:38,911
been like laser, like focus for
me as far as, since then. And,

480
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:44,851
um, just the looks of frustration
on faces of people that I've

481
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:49,831
seen, trying to access something
that's inaccessible on the web.

482
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:58,416
Yeah. It's just, it's very, um,
the word I'm looking for here,

483
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:04,086
very, uh, it hits home. It
really, you know, being that I

484
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:12,186
try to advocate for people that
don't have a voice. And, um, I

485
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:17,452
think as, as accessibility,
professional, We all, do we try

486
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:24,532
to advocate for those people? Um,
especially lately with certain, I

487
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:28,641
will use it in quotes,
accessibility, overlays, for

488
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:35,331
instance, but, um, yeah, that's
basically where it all started

489
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:40,581
was just those family members and
friends and just seeing people,

490
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:45,711
uh, yeah. Th the frustration and
the point where they're ready to

491
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:46,282
give up.

492
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:53,067
Bekah: Yeah, I, was just with
Chris last week. Um, he spoke at

493
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:58,117
KC DC. He along with Cass Ferris
and they did anaccessibility

494
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:00,777
talk. That was the first time I
got to see him speak in person.

495
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:05,052
It was really great because they
both come at it with a lot of

496
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:09,581
passion and examples. And I think
for so many of us, we have a

497
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,001
general sense of what
accessibility is, but we don't

498
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:18,876
have that broader sense of, uh,
you know, it might be. Um, there

499
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:23,257
might be a disability that you
can't see, or it might be a

500
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:27,007
temporary disability or a mental
health challenge that somebody is

501
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:30,126
going through and all of those
things can impact what

502
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:34,177
accessibility looks like. And if
you really look at the people

503
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:39,681
around you, you for sure know
someone that has one of those

504
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:43,492
challenges or, or you have one
yourself. And so, you know,

505
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,192
opening up the conversations
about this, you know, like you

506
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:50,751
have in, in like Chris and Cass
have, I think is so important to

507
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,902
really making change in, in tech
overall.

508
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:58,871
Todd: Yeah, I, you, know, you you
brought up invisible.

509
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:06,297
Disabilities. I have migraine
headaches. Uh, I get them when

510
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:11,306
something sets off, if there's a
website, I visit that as, you

511
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:17,306
know, animation or motion that
really it's too much. And it's

512
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:20,757
triggers a migraine. I mean,
there's all that stuff that you

513
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:26,541
mentioned and. Yeah. It's, you
know, uh, Chris is great. You

514
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:33,231
know, I, I I've seen him talk,
you know, virtually and then

515
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,132
before the pandemic and
everything, and we've gotten to

516
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:41,481
know each other and he, you know,
he does a great job advocating.

517
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,369
Bekah: yeah. I think, you know,
even so a couple of years ago I

518
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:48,090
was diagnosed with ADHD and it's
interesting how much I didn't

519
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,650
realize that impacts the things
that I interact with and the ways

520
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,965
that I interact with things.
Maybe this is just a personal

521
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,905
problem, but this is the
conversation between Discord and

522
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:04,135
Slack. For me, like I walk into
Discord, I don't walk in there.

523
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:08,875
Um, I open up Discord and it's
immediately just overwhelming and

524
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:11,514
I don't know where to go from
there. And then I just like

525
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,655
slowly back out the door, right?
Like there's too much going on

526
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,135
for me.

527
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:19,657
Todd: Yeah. That information
overload happens to me as well.

528
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:28,811
Um, it's like Slack and, uh,
Discord and. There's yeah, I was

529
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:35,532
on, I was watching a, uh, Twitch
stream yesterday and the chat was

530
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:39,882
going off and I was just like, I
just, I can't, I want to be able

531
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:44,112
to kind of read the chat and I
can't because you know it, yeah.

532
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:46,481
The information overload is a big
thing too.

533
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:52,929
Bekah: So I, you know, I think,
um, Your background, you talked

534
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:57,400
about your journey through this
and it seems like you've been

535
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,679
mostly self-taught then, is that
right?

536
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:05,911
Todd: Yeah. Um, I started, when I
picked up that Commodore 64 user

537
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:13,771
manual. And just, I love to read
and I read that I had purchased a

538
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:21,871
book. It was a Learn HTML in 21
days. And it was like a big, huge

539
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:26,851
thick phone book, like manual.
And I read through that. That's

540
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:33,242
how I actually made my first
website. Uh, not that I put it

541
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:39,632
out on the web or anything, but
then I. Um, I graduated from

542
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:43,891
there on, I went to Geo Cities
and Angel Fire and Tripod and all

543
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,922
those websites, if you remember
those websites

544
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:47,612
Dan: here. Yeah.

545
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,411
Todd: and all the great, you
know, lime green and pastel and,

546
00:41:52,742 --> 00:42:00,376
you know, fluorescent colors. Um,
and then, you know, It's been a

547
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:04,847
learning process the entire time
and I love to learn. So it's one

548
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,456
of those things where if I can
pick up something in a Slack

549
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:13,427
group or on a Discord channel,
that's great. I've, you know, I

550
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:19,947
keep learning every day and, you
know, learning. Lately it's been

551
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:23,936
learning the intricacies of the
WCAG guidelines because there's

552
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:29,577
so much there. Um, and being able
to, and I'm grateful for this

553
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:36,177
being able to work on the next, I
guess, version, which is 3.0,

554
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:41,097
which is a few years down the
road has been a learning process

555
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:45,086
as well. And being a member of
the W3C is to, and being in those

556
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:49,902
meetings and. We're learning so
much from a great group of

557
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:50,322
people.

558
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:54,152
Bekah: Yeah, that's awesome. I
love that idea of just consistent

559
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:57,121
learning and being open to
learning all of the time, because

560
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:02,161
I think no matter what part of
tech or, or any industry really

561
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,612
that you're in the being open to
learning new things and talking

562
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:09,782
through things with other people.
and understanding is, you know,

563
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:14,251
that that's what growing is
about. That's what is important

564
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:14,882
to what you're doing.

565
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:23,001
Todd: Yeah. It's, you know, even
I've, you know, learned, I

566
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:26,722
learned on Twitter as well, you
know, I see something, a link to

567
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:30,262
an article or something and I
check it out and it's like, oh,

568
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:37,981
well, you know, Today I learned,
you know, and you know, I it's

569
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:43,141
it's, you know, there was a quote
and I'll try to find that quote

570
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:49,532
because I love the quote. Um, it
had something to do with, uh,

571
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:57,601
doing something. Yeah, right
there. Um, there are three

572
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:03,976
things. Everyone should do every
day. Number one is laugh. Number

573
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:09,407
two is think, spend some time in
thought number three, you should

574
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:13,036
have your emotions, you to tears.
If you laugh, think and cry,

575
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:17,476
that's a heck of a day. And that
was just like the best quote. I

576
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,916
think I've seen it in a long,
long time. I even add to that

577
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,137
learning one thing a day.

578
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:27,838
Bekah: Yeah. I love that so much.
I didn't think, you know,

579
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:32,398
learning things on Twitter for me
has been really big as well. Even

580
00:44:32,398 --> 00:44:36,239
when somebody just has a small
portion of a tweet at, for some

581
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,329
reason, it sticks in my mind
better than if I read a whole

582
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,418
article on that thing. And I
think maybe because there's some

583
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:46,139
type of personal connection
there. Oh, I remember that person

584
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:48,929
said this one thing and it, you
know, it might be some type of

585
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,338
coding tip or whatever, but I
think that just be just sharing

586
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,568
that knowledge or, or it's Hey, I
know that I could ask that

587
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:02,849
person. That question can be
really helpful in finding the

588
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,768
answers to things or having more
confidence in, in being, being

589
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,298
able to ask questions.

590
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:17,648
Todd: Yeah. It's it's, you know,
I use Twitter as a tool to say,

591
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:22,358
you know, oh, you, you mentioned
something about the new, you

592
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:28,418
know, um, whatever coming, coming
down the line. I've got a couple

593
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:33,349
of questions for you. Um, you
know, Hey, can I, you know, DM

594
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,998
you, I got a question I need to
ask and it reaching out to

595
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:40,869
somebody to, or to the person
that, you know, had that tweet

596
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:47,228
it's, uh, and, and Mo you know, I
don't think I've ever had anybody

597
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:50,259
go no I don't want to tell you
the answer or anything like that.

598
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:55,418
So, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's
always been, you know, Hey, you

599
00:45:55,418 --> 00:46:00,074
know, I've got this question.
People are more than, you know,

600
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:04,304
more than welcome to, to answer
those questions.

601
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,943
Bekah: Yeah. And I think that's
so big, especially when we're

602
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:11,244
talking about this topic. If you
don't know it is okay to ask

603
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:15,173
somebody, Or ask someone just to
direct you, you know, I'm getting

604
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,833
started in this. It's not been a
focus. How, how do I get started?

605
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:22,764
What do I do? And dropped a lot
of great resources here, but, you

606
00:46:22,764 --> 00:46:26,333
know, I think in, in every place
and space we should, we should

607
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:29,454
know that it is okay to ask about
these things. And it's good to do

608
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:29,813
that.

609
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:34,358
Todd: Yeah, definitely. You know,
I tell people, you know, if you

610
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,119
have a question about
accessibility, I'll do my best to

611
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,688
answer. If I can't answer it, I
will find somebody that can, or I

612
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:43,518
will look it up and see if I can
get you the answer, because it's,

613
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:47,463
it's, it's that little, you know,
it's that being helpful? And

614
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:50,364
again, making, you know, making
sure that person has that

615
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:54,594
information for me anyways, is,
is big. And, you know, just

616
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:57,684
saying, you know, feeling good
about being able to help people.

617
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,364
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. That's so
important.

618
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:02,224
Dan: I love it.

619
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,818
Bekah: we have about one a time
for one more question. And, and

620
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:09,099
I'd love to hear what you have to
say about this. Cause I know that

621
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,699
there still are companies out
there that are, um, have some

622
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:18,398
pushback about paying for making
things accessible, or they say

623
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:20,588
like, well, that's not our focus
right now because we don't have

624
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,668
the time or the money to do that.
How would you that situation? Or,

625
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,639
you know, maybe if you were a
developer consulting on that, you

626
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,398
know, how would you kind of
convince them that this, this

627
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:31,179
should be a priority?

628
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:36,463
Todd: Okay. Funny. You mentioned
that. Cause I wrote a article,

629
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:42,164
uh, about that and it's on
smashing magazine. So I'll get

630
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:51,798
that. Link to you as well. It's a
very tricky slope sometimes. Um,

631
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:55,608
you know, I've heard people for
instance say, well, you don't

632
00:47:55,608 --> 00:48:00,534
want to get sued. And that kind
of. Perks up stakeholders ears

633
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,353
and says, oh, you know, well, I
guess we're going to have to do

634
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:14,934
this me. I use real world
examples of, for instance, I ran

635
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:21,083
into a stakeholder on a project
and I said, we've got to make

636
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:24,054
sure accessibility is done from
the very beginning of the

637
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:27,773
project. He turned to me and
said, we don't have disabled

638
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:33,233
users. I in turn said to him,
you're wearing eyeglasses, that's

639
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:38,454
an assistive technology and he
kind of perked up, but I'd,

640
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:43,403
hadn't convinced him. So the, you
know, there's some people that

641
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:47,934
can be very stubborn. So I went
as far as to say, you know,

642
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:52,974
somebody's working. You know,
using your product, they can have

643
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,554
a broken arm, it could be a
situational disability. They

644
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,224
could have a broken arm. They
could be at home working with a

645
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:02,094
child on their lap. That's very
fussy. I've been there a long

646
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:08,713
time ago. I know that feeling and
I, you know, I know Bekah, you're

647
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,753
a parent. I don't know if you're
a parent, Dan, but.

648
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:11,253
Dan: yeah.

649
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:15,264
Todd: Yeah. Yeah. So you both
know that, you know, you have a

650
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:18,563
child on your lap and they're
fussy, you know, and you're

651
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:22,164
trying to answer an email or
something. It's very difficult.

652
00:49:22,164 --> 00:49:30,653
So, you know, getting teams on
board is another thing too, where

653
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:35,918
getting somebody. A person
dedicated to doing accessibility

654
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,338
on the design side, on the
development side, on the

655
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:45,009
marketing side. That helps too.
But the main thing is getting

656
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:50,199
stakeholders on board. If you can
get a stakeholder on board, then

657
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,088
it should be much, much easier to
get the entire organization on

658
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:55,498
board.

659
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,599
Bekah: Yeah, that's great. I love
that. You know, it all comes down

660
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,228
to listening and being
open-minded right. If we work

661
00:50:03,228 --> 00:50:07,248
towards understanding each other,
then we can all do a whole lot

662
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:09,139
more to improve things for
everyone.

663
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:15,188
Todd: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely. Yep. I've heard it,

664
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:19,268
I've heard it before. We don't
have the budget, you know, we'll

665
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:26,418
get to it after launch. Well,
that brings me back to. Yep. If

666
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,998
you do everything from the
beginning, you will have the

667
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:33,108
money for it and you know, it
will be less stressed, so, yeah.

668
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:35,188
Dan: don't need to pay for it.
Find the budget to pay for a

669
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:38,454
whole round of. You know,
auditing and stuff.

670
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:45,298
Todd: Right. Yeah. And auditing.
So I'll use an example of a

671
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:53,664
company that got sued and what
they could have. What they could

672
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:57,623
have spent just with, you know,
doing it from the beginning, they

673
00:50:57,623 --> 00:51:03,804
ended up paying seven figures for
an audit. So that should tell you

674
00:51:03,804 --> 00:51:05,634
something about that process.

675
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,199
Bekah: Right. And it shouldn't
ever have to come to that. That's

676
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,989
know, absolutely ridiculous,

677
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:11,793
Todd: yeah.

678
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:14,768
Bekah: But I'm so glad that you
were here today to talk us

679
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,228
through this and drop all of
these great resources. And I

680
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:21,338
really hope that, you know, it
helps people who are listening to

681
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,878
work through the stuff. And to
know that it's okay to ask

682
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:30,233
questions. And to Grow and learn
more all the time. Um, so we'll

683
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:33,563
make sure that we drop all those
links in the show notes. And

684
00:51:33,713 --> 00:51:35,634
thanks so much for being here
with us today. Todd

685
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:37,134

686

Todd: Yeah. Thank you both for
having me

Bekah: Bye.

689
00:51:41,824 --> 00:51:44,023
Dan: alright, bye Todd.
