00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,529
Bekah: Hello and welcome to
season two, episode nine of the

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:13,489
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,449
that

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,408
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:21,953
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:23,498
their

7
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:26,559
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,124
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:29,689
it with

10
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,779
you. Here with me today is my
cohost Dan

11
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:36,753
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Um, we have a
cool episode today. We thought

12
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,094
we'd do a little, something a
little bit different. It's our

13
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:44,033
last episode of season two. Um,
it is our what? Eighteenth...

14
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:50,914
I've lost count many? Yeah, 18th
episode. Um, and. Last time we

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,493
are last season one finale,
Bekah and I talked about our own

16
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,042
coding

17
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:58,904
journeys. Um, and so we didn't
want to do that again. Uh, so we

18
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:01,124
thought this time we would talk
a little bit about what we've

19
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:04,034
learned, over the last year
building Virtual Coffee, what

20
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:08,103
we've been thinking about, with
Virtual Coffee, vis-a-vis

21
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:11,563
communities and, some of the
struggles, challenges, things

22
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,724
we're excited about, um, and
stuff

23
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,488
Bekah: Yeah, we love being
available to talk through kind

24
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,838
of

25
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:21,259
our approach to what the things
that we've been doing and the

26
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,149
challenges that we've faced. And
to share that with everybody,

27
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,948
because I think that we have a
lot of stuff that happens behind

28
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:33,243
the scenes. And it's nice to be
able to talk about that in a

29
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,538
way,

30
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:38,748
and to talk about all the
support that we've had from the

31
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:41,539
community, and to be able to
share that as well.

32
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:45,603
Dan: Yeah, Um, it was maybe a
little bit of a long

33
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,554
conversation, but it was, uh, I
don't know, as very fun. And I

34
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,634
think that, I think people are
gonna enjoy it.

35
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:56,162
Bekah: Yeah, I sure hope so. I
enjoyed it. We start every

36
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:59,433
episode of the podcast. Like we
started every Virtual Coffee. We

37
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,962
introduced ourselves with our
name where we're from and what

38
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,491
we

39
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:06,362
do, and a random check in
question. Today's random.

40
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:08,912
Check-in question is if you had
a remote control, it was only

41
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,462
one

42
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:14,643
button that controlled something
in your life, what would the

43
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:21,251
button do? We hope you enjoy
this episode. I am Bekah. I am a

44
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:27,859
front

45
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:34,008
end developer from a small town
in Ohio. And if I had a remote

46
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:39,258
control with one button, I would
do the Zack Morris button from

47
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,136
Saved by the Bell. You can't see
it, but Dan rolled his eyes.

48
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:45,014
Like

49
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:46,563
Dan: I did not I was nodding

50
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,604
Bekah: You rolled your eyes. I
saw it

51
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,644
Dan: well, if I did, it

52
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:53,734
Bekah: doing the timeout button
because sometimes my kids need a

53
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:59,104
timeout, but also I need the
timeout. So I am having a pause

54
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,274
on life button.

55
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,468
Dan: Yep. Well, if I did roll my
eyes because that was going to

56
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,882
be

57
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,243
my answer too. Although the Zack
Morris part, I did not make that

58
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:11,593
connection. Um, honestly that
might be, that's like a good

59
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,843
upgrade because, um, you know,
he had somebody to talk to,

60
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:16,063
right.

61
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,973
Like he says time out and then
he's like, talks it out with the

62
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:22,574
audience, you know, the pause,
the pause idea that that would

63
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:25,454
definitely be mine too. There's
many times where it's just, you

64
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:29,743
know, whether it's like, maybe I
need a break, but lots of times,

65
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:32,324
uh, I would like to pause to
just sort of figure out what is

66
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,533
happening in the moment or, you
know, what I'm going to say or,

67
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,918
uh, things like that. So, or
just to get a little extra time

68
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,243
in the

69
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,418
day, I suppose, although with
the pause thing, um, you know,

70
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:44,593
do you

71
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:50,084
get older? Like, do you continue
aging while it's paused? You

72
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:50,324
know,

73
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,984
Bekah: I wrote a screenplay
about that.

74
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,033
Dan: Well, what happened in the
screenplay?

75
00:03:56,044 --> 00:04:01,743
Bekah: Well, the protagonist,
she could move through the time

76
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,463
pauses. And so for her. One time
was paused for everyone else,

77
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,183
she

78
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:13,304
just sped up through those
pauses. And so she kept up with

79
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,208
everyone else, but she just had
the ability to kind of like do

80
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,112
it

81
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,903
on her own time without anybody
noticing.

82
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,459
Dan: Okay. So she didn't like

83
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,843
Bekah: I did some deep research
into physics, so

84
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:26,598
Dan: yeah.

85
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:31,204
Bekah: it could happen. Also

86
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:31,788
Dan: All right. Well, there you

87
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,663
Bekah: teacher from high school
was the worst, so

88
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,499
Dan: I'm sorry about that.

89
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,043
Bekah: I'm not a physicist.

90
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:41,238
Dan: That's exactly it. Yep.
It's the same. Yeah. I had to

91
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:44,118
get

92
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:46,488
actually I'd have, I liked her
physics teacher, but he was

93
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:47,628
cool,

94
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:51,139
but I also ended up not a
physicist.

95
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:55,173
Bekah: Hmm. My physics teacher
hated me. And so my lab partner

96
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,303
would always get A's on lab
reports and I would write the

97
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:03,014
same thing and she would give me
CS. I don't understand. Are we

98
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:05,413
going to do a therapy session
about my physics teacher today?

99
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:05,653
Okay.

100
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,678
Dan: I don't know if we need to.
We can.

101
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:13,504
Bekah: It will save that for a
different time. Um, as somebody

102
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:18,423
asked me recently about Virtual
Coffee and like, what are the

103
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:22,353
pain points that you feel what
are the things that are

104
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:27,334
challenging for you? And I said,
well, there's not 40 hours in a

105
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:32,374
day. And that's the most
challenging thing for me. There

106
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,708
are so many ideas and so many
things I would love to be able

107
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,042
to

108
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,658
do. Um, but just cannot happen
because there are hours in a

109
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:42,273
day.

110
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,579
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean
like that's, I mean, that's the

111
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:53,524
biggest, the biggest issue. You
know, I mean, we both work for

112
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:56,053
living, not for like, not for
Virtual Coffee. Right. I mean,

113
00:05:56,413 --> 00:06:01,004
uh, and so that's, that's, I
mean, that's always going to be

114
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,334
an issue. Right. And so one of
the things that we've been

115
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,074
working on really hard for the
last, however many months is,

116
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,814
um,

117
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:13,564
trying to, uh, get people
involved in, in helping out, um,

118
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:16,173
you know, but in, in, in ways
that both support them and

119
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:17,134
support us, you know,

120
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:21,713
Bekah: I mean, it's such a
important thing, right? Because

121
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,660
we're. Doing this thing and
we're building community and

122
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,607
we're

123
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,189
coding along with it. Like
whether it's part of the

124
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:34,069
community or what, or whether it
is part of a paying job. And I

125
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,409
think like it's a real
challenge, no matter where you

126
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,749
are, if

127
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,288
you're starting a community,
sometimes you start it

128
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,889
intentionally sometimes like
Virtual Coffee, it just kind of

129
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,668
happens authentically and then
you try and go with it. And

130
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,928
there's so many lessons that are
learned along the way. I want to

131
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:57,348
backtrack a little bit though,
and just kind of, um, explain

132
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,978
what Virtual Coffee is, because
I also get that question a lot.

133
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,053
Like, what is Virtual Coffee?
Like, what do you do? And for

134
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,128
me,

135
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,261
like the hardest part of that is
describing what we do at

136
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,393
virtual.

137
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,133
like, I think that I can
describe it, but I really want

138
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,843
to capture

139
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:17,043
like that energy and like all of
the beautiful interactions that

140
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,684
we have with people and like
getting to know people and to

141
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:24,093
understand them. And I just have
a really hard time being saying

142
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:28,444
like, oh, well, we meet up twice
a week and we chat and we have a

143
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:32,254
slack and then we usually have a
brown bag every week. And we do

144
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,254
these events and newsletters and
podcasts. And those feel like,

145
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,483
like I'm like doing a checklist
of all the things we do. And it

146
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:43,863
doesn't quite capture, I think
who we are. And I'm not really

147
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,204
sure how to do that. So I don't
know if you have ideas for that,

148
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,093
Dan, but, um,

149
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,698
Dan: Yeah, I, mean, I, would
say, well, if I wanted to,

150
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:54,728
succinctly,

151
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:59,168
you know, summarize what Virtual
Coffee is, I guess, uh, this is

152
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,559
just off the top of my head, but
I would say it's an intimate

153
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,238
community for developers.

154
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:05,814
Bekah: oh yeah. Is that off the
top of your head?

155
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,759
Dan: Um, no, I mean, that's,
that's it though, right? I mean,

156
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,319
it's, it's, it's just an
intimate community, right. And

157
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,879
it's, uh,

158
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,358
I, and I, and the intimate part
is, is, uh, important and

159
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:20,658
distinctive part of Virtual
Coffee, um, to me and all of the

160
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:24,348
things that you described. I
mean, some, I'm sure there's

161
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,288
communities doing all sorts of
different pieces of those, or,

162
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,229
you know, uh, like individually.
Um, but the way that we have

163
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,853
ended up, you know, both, both
through our direction and

164
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,248
through

165
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:41,328
following, you know, w the
member's direction and, um, and

166
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,768
everything is, is this commute
people who know each other

167
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:44,208
pretty

168
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:48,469
well, we have stuck through the
two days a week meet up, which

169
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:52,393
is, um, nobody's really doing.
Um, and it's an integral part

170
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:56,287
of,

171
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,033
uh, our community identity. Um,
I feel like it is the

172
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,388
face-to-face

173
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:05,979
conversations. Um, you know, we
have a slack there's. Everybody

174
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,458
is part of a million different
slacks, developers, slacks, or,

175
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:14,139
you know, Discord stuff like
that. Um, and one of the nice

176
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:17,109
things about our slack is that
I've seen all these people's

177
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:20,198
faces. You know, I I've talked
to them, um, you know, in, in

178
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:23,287
not

179
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:27,609
just like sitting next to them
at some presentation or not, you

180
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:32,229
know, anything like that. Right.
It's the w our, our

181
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,523
conversations, we have
conversations. Um, our events

182
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,817
our

183
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:37,399
brown bags, are presentations,
but they are, you know, member

184
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,778
led things, right. They're not
just us, the organizers, you

185
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:44,928
know, pumping out content and
expecting, you know, expecting

186
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:47,118
our members to join, uh, or
something like that. Right.

187
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,308
It's,

188
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,378
it's that the members that are
doing the presentations, um,

189
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,448
have

190
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:57,469
something to share and they want
to share it with our group. Um,

191
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,903
and you know, I was. Uh, we, we
just did the Magnolia

192
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,437
conference.

193
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:08,298
Um, we, we were a community
sponsor for Magnolia JS and I

194
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,788
missed a second one. My son was
sick for the second day of the

195
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,999
conference, so I missed it, but
what Virtual Coffee did there

196
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,609
was, um, did a Virtual Coffee
style, lunch table, zoom

197
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,219
meeting.

198
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:24,068
Right. Um, and, and went, and we
did breakout rooms with small,

199
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,379
small, you know, I had six
people in my room I think. And

200
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,629
it was

201
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,218
great. I, I, I've never been to
a online thing that is on

202
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:31,807
anything

203
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:35,859
like that before, you know, we
I've been to online events, uh,

204
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,018
where there's a, there's a
discord or a slacker or some

205
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,177
sort

206
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,568
of chat, you know, and that's
always fun. And I was, I was

207
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,609
having fun at the Magnolia one
and I have fun in our slack too.

208
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,764
Right. Um, but. And, and the
talks were really, really good.

209
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,884
Uh, I've been to a lot of good
conferences, you know, over the

210
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:57,144
years. Um, and this was one of
them. Um, but like the lunch

211
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:58,853
conversation was, I w I was
just, I had, I was in a table in

212
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,562
a

213
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:04,283
breakout room with people I'd
never met before. And Kayla was

214
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,143
in my room, uh, who organized
the event and she's awesome, but

215
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,003
I

216
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:10,913
had never talked to her before I
chatted with her, but I never,

217
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,188
um, I don't think she's come to
Virtual Coffee. I know she's

218
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,402
come

219
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:14,588
to Virtual Coffees. I'd never
had been in a breakout room with

220
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:15,773
her

221
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:19,344
before. Um, and it was really
great. And w with the six of us

222
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,573
just like talked, we talked
about what we were learning. And

223
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:21,802
we

224
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,754
talked about, um, some struggles
that we've been going through,

225
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:28,043
and it was just half an hour or
something like that. Um, but it,

226
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:34,214
I came out of that. Like, uh, it
it's one of the things, that and

227
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:36,138
Kenneth, um, one of the things
I'm going to like, remember

228
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,062
about

229
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:44,464
that event for a long time, you
know, um, the. Like the way the

230
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,894
Virtual Coffee's ended up with
fostering these conversations,

231
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:51,484
and, um, with small groups of
people is I feel like that's,

232
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:54,183
that is the, like, that's the
key, right? Um, the intimacy

233
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:56,703
and,

234
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:00,394
um, to keep like people have
people. Um, and we can talk

235
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,274
about

236
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:05,433
this more later, I think, but
like, people have talked to us

237
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,433
about scale and like prepare for
scale and all this stuff, you

238
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:13,025
can't have this at scale. And, I
just disagree. I think we're

239
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,765
going to, I think we're going to
figure it out and we're on our,

240
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,240
on our way down the path of
figuring it out, um, because

241
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,625
this

242
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,045
community is, um, is great and
we have, we have been holding

243
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,805
onto

244
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:28,775
the things that make it great.
And like we have also, and I'd

245
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:29,970
like to hear more about what you
think about this, but I feel

246
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,165
like

247
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:34,946
over the last. Six months, um,
really been trying to figure out

248
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,865
what it is that makes us great,
you know, it makes this

249
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,784
community

250
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:44,696
great. Um, besides the members
who, who, who are great, uh, you

251
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:50,245
know, but they could have gone
somewhere else or right. Every

252
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:54,326
single one of them and including
us, I suppose, and why they, you

253
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:58,466
know, like what, you know,
finding, finding out what it is

254
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,586
like, why they keep coming back.
Why they're here is, is, uh, has

255
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:02,336
been interesting too.

256
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,445
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. I there's
something I think of all the

257
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,290
time

258
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:10,471
and I always bring up to people
like anybody can open up a zoom,

259
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,461
right? There's um, you can start
a meeting, you can start a chat

260
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,535
with other people, but we're
here and it's been such a nice

261
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,609
thing.

262
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,686
And. You know, Dan, you pretty
sure you're the one that came up

263
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,576
with the tagline: "An intimate
community for all devs,

264
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:28,466
optimized

265
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:33,505
for you." Right. And early on
when we were like, just really

266
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,025
trying to figure out like, okay,
like what are we, how can we

267
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:39,296
define that? And, and that's
right. Like, I feel like I

268
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:43,466
that's, that's where I need to
put my emphasis on this idea of

269
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,466
an intimate community, because
you don't really hear that ever.

270
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:50,066
And if you're talking about like
tech communities, but it's true.

271
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,230
And I was asking some of our
more senior people, so somebody

272
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,335
had

273
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,706
asked me, okay, I understand why
new or early career devs are

274
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,970
there, like networking, trying
to find jobs and stuff. And

275
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,234
that's

276
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:09,596
part of it, but that's not like,
that's not the essence of what

277
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:13,556
Virtual Coffee is. And so they
had asked me like, well, why do

278
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:16,225
your senior devs come? And so I
reached out to a couple of them

279
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,130
in there and the answer was
like, We're friends, you know,

280
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,035
like I,

281
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:24,836
I know who your kids are, and I
know about you personally and

282
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:28,615
that personal connection is, is
what makes it special. I think,

283
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:32,365
because it's not like, yes, some
people will come through Virtual

284
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:37,225
Coffee and they won't be able to
come back or they'll find a new

285
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:40,556
job and they'll leave. And like
every time we have a person that

286
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:43,061
comes and they're looking for a
job and they find a new job, I

287
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,566
am

288
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:47,756
simultaneously super happy for
them. And like super sad,

289
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,916
because

290
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:54,056
I don't know if they're going to
be back here, but like, I don't

291
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:56,605
think that I'm the only person
that feels that, right? Like

292
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,635
these are our friends and we
have this time to spend with

293
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:02,035
them and

294
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,075
to share with them. And I'm
like, I always defined myself as

295
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,115
like a

296
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,550
shy introvert and this, this
week, my, my introvertedness,

297
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,985
um,

298
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,785
Was taxed a little bit because I
had so much stuff going on, but

299
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,395
still it's like, these are the
people that I look for forward

300
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:22,555
to

301
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:28,826
seeing all the time. And we
decided fairly early on ish. I

302
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,586
think that if you wanted to
become a member, you had to

303
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:34,495
attend Virtual Coffee because
there's something very special

304
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:38,096
that happens at those coffees
because you hear other people

305
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:43,105
because, um, you can see other
people in those moments and we

306
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,235
really just try to embrace
people where they're at. So, you

307
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,365
know,

308
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,605
like we are also say like, you
don't have to participate. You

309
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,125
can just come and listen, you
don't have to turn your camera

310
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,326
on. But for me, you know, one of
the most important things is

311
00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:00,956
like, let's recognize every
single member where they're at.

312
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:04,436
And, and yet like exactly what
you said, Dan, people say, well,

313
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:07,371
this can't scale. I'm like,
well, we'll figure it out. You

314
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:10,306
know,

315
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:14,306
because. We know there's
something special here and we

316
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,865
want to keep moving forward with
that.

317
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,035
Dan: Yeah, And that's, you know,
that's a good point about how

318
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,369
we,

319
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:23,620
we decided about, the way into
Virtual Coffee is through the

320
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,690
coffees. Right. You know, we
have the slack, um, and it's

321
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,760
great,

322
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,410
you know, but it's, it's sort
of, uh and it's almost, almost,

323
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,850
almost a side. It's not right. I
mean, cause people there every

324
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,485
day, but you know, it's, it's
um, we never wanted it to this

325
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,120
to

326
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,985
just be a slack developer
community. Cause they end up

327
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:49,775
being the same, you know, a lot
of times. And um, you know,

328
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,705
that's been a kind of a
struggle, right? Cause I mean,

329
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:51,635
you, you,

330
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,846
you have people, you want people
to come and, and you want people

331
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:59,385
to, be able to join. Um, so
that's something we, you know,

332
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,206
we've also been trying to figure
out, right. Is, is, uh, how can

333
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,486
we do that? How can we expand a
little bit, you know, how can we

334
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,705
slowly grow? Uh, you know, and
we have, it's funny, we have,

335
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,864
um,

336
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,385
there's some annoying hoops you
have to jump through. Um, I

337
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:12,944
think

338
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:16,816
to join right now and we have
sort of purposely kept those up

339
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:21,756
for, for awhile, to slow down,
um, the rate of people, people

340
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:28,236
joining, um, artificially just a
little bit, um, you know, w. We

341
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:31,566
have, we have some plans, uh,
some concrete, some not so much

342
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:34,355
concrete, you know, to improve
all of that stuff and to improve

343
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:38,586
the flow and to make it easier
for people to join. Um, and, but

344
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:43,355
I think that's, I think that my
suspicion is that is still going

345
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,776
to be the case for us is that
we're always going to be, you

346
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:48,306
know, the, the Virtual Coffee
will be the entrance. Um,

347
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:49,836
whether

348
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,666
it looks exactly the same as,
you know, as it does now, it

349
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,496
might,

350
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:57,846
might or might not. But, um,
that's like, that's the key that

351
00:17:57,855 --> 00:18:00,025
the coffees for us are the key
to everything else. Um, am I, am

352
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,195
I

353
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:07,086
like, in my opinion anyway, you
know, and I'm sure some members

354
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,145
will find, you know, find more
value in certain parts and some

355
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:13,405
members find more value in other
parts, you know, but the, the,

356
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:19,605
the coffees themselves, I feel
like are unique. Um, the coffees

357
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:23,480
and the enthusiasm for, um,
being together in a room, um, is

358
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,355
like,

359
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,165
that's, you know, that's it
right? So the coffees are like

360
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,665
the automated always scheduled
ways to do that, you know, and

361
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,135
we

362
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,476
have, we have other ways to do
that too. Even the brown bags,

363
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:39,955
um, the w the brown bags are
generally more presentation

364
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:44,336
style. Um, but they are still on
zoom for us, um, on zoom most of

365
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:47,935
the time. And which means it's
still people, you know, kind of

366
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,960
that, you know, already in a
room together. Um, and then one

367
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,894
of our

368
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:54,806
members will be just presenting
something that they want to

369
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,236
share, which is, uh, which is
cool too.

370
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,300
Bekah: Yeah, well, I think it's
so nice because it, because you

371
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,050
know, so many of the people and
you have seen them in Virtual

372
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,825
Coffee, it, when you give a
brown bag, it's a little bit

373
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,600
different

374
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,656
than, you know, so a brown bag
is about 60 minutes. You can

375
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,711
talk

376
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:21,500
for anywhere between a half an
hour plus, um, and you are

377
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,736
talking about one particular
topic and sometimes there's

378
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:25,611
times

379
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:29,080
for questions. Depending on the
speaker, the questions might be

380
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,111
throughout otherwise they're at
the end, but there's always that

381
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:36,040
continual relationship, that
content that happens in slack.

382
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,191
And so you can ask the questions
there or it's like, okay, I know

383
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,171
that person talked about that
and I can touch base with them.

384
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:43,151
And,

385
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,550
um, you know, the, the nice
thing is when you are doing

386
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,530
these

387
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,560
things, it feels like less of a
risk because you're doing it in

388
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,855
front of people that, you know,
and that you're supported by.

389
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,150
And

390
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:59,080
so I talked about this, I don't
know where I talked about it

391
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,290
recently, but you know, for me,
I give conference talks and I

392
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,500
keep

393
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,040
doing it to myself, but I was
super nervous and anxious before

394
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,111
and like burn out by the end
because the anxiety just like

395
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,276
consumes me. Um, But when I can
see other people's faces,

396
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:23,381
especially the faces of people.
I know, um, it provides this

397
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:26,486
more,

398
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:31,726
more comfortable atmosphere, I
guess. So like I gave this talk

399
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:38,056
recently about my journey into
tech and when I gave it, I, I,

400
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,315
the last two times I gave it, I
just like started crying from

401
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,515
the

402
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,225
very beginning. And I'm like,
oh, that's, that's what you want

403
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,934
from

404
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:49,756
a conference speaker crying. But
what helped me to be able to

405
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:54,165
refocus is looking out into the
people that were there and it

406
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,776
wasn't a Virtual Coffee event,
but there were Virtual Coffee

407
00:20:56,776 --> 00:21:00,105
people there. And I knew like,
okay, like, these are my people.

408
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:04,096
They're here. They've heard my
story before, but they're here

409
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,705
because they're supporting me
and they're willing to support

410
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,285
me as

411
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:12,915
I grow through this and cry
through this 50 minute

412
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:19,736
presentation of things. Um, and
it just. You know, allowed me to

413
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:24,145
kind of stretch myself and to
grow in that moment and to lean

414
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:28,766
on them. Like I know the first
time I gave the talk, I, Karen

415
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:34,346
Dickinson was there and Karen
just like her, she was just

416
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:36,925
giving me the head nod, you
know, and the smile and the

417
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:39,925
affirmation. I'm like, okay. Um,
I'm just going to look at Karen

418
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,445
and I'm not going to look at
anybody else because all I need

419
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:44,485
in this moment is Karen. And
that only happens because, you

420
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,525
know, I

421
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:49,855
met Karen at Virtual Coffee
because I'm comfortable with her

422
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,060
because I have shared with her
before. And so me as a person

423
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,265
who

424
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:58,496
really struggles with forming, I
think, um, authentic

425
00:21:58,556 --> 00:22:04,526
relationships with other people
to have that and to be able to

426
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:10,016
lean on that was, you know, just
one of the nicest moments in my

427
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:10,556
life.

428
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:13,635
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome.
Yeah. Virtual Coffee, real

429
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:15,809
strong

430
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,871
at other people's events, for
sure. As I always, I love seeing

431
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,690
that. I, you know, I, even my,
um, my, I have a Cleveland

432
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,509
react,

433
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,355
you know, meetup group. And
since it has started, you know,

434
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,140
since,

435
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:31,290
um, photocopies kicked off and
whatever, um, there's always,

436
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,625
there's always a few people
there too, which is, which is

437
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,930
just

438
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,871
great. I dunno. It's, it's, it
is fun. It's, it's great to have

439
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:40,770
your, your friends and these
people, you know, um, and my

440
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,766
like, outside of tech, aren't
going to come to my tech, you

441
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,445
know, related talk, you know,
and you know what I mean? Like,

442
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,124
uh,

443
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,455
they don't want to hear it.
Excuse me. I talk about react or

444
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,115
whatever enough around them as
it is. Nobody wants to, you

445
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:56,775
know,

446
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,516
you know what I mean? But like,
so, so it's, I mean, and that's

447
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,645
people talk about how, how
important it is to have

448
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:04,870
community, any, any, you know,
a, I'm gonna say any community,

449
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,095
any

450
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,365
community of people who care
about you, you know? Um, I feel

451
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,460
like it's very important for
Chicago is obviously not the

452
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,555
only

453
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:18,955
one. Um, but we do have a large
amount of very awesome people.

454
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,040
Bekah: I mean, we have so many
great people and I think like

455
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,891
some of the lessons that we've
learned over the last year,

456
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:29,201
that's, that's another question
I commonly get from people. Like

457
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,901
what lessons have you learned?
So my lessons, the lessons that

458
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,601
I've

459
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:37,641
learned, like one of them is
communication. I've grown as a

460
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:39,876
communicator so much, and last
year it was hard and it felt

461
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,111
very

462
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:45,740
terrible and awful the entire
way. So I'm not saying that it

463
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,530
was an easy process, but like.
Being able to communicate with

464
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,490
people and to talk about those
hard truths. I think sometimes

465
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,310
it's still a work in progress.
Right. And, and Karen, who I

466
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,820
mentioned before led the book
club conversation on Radical

467
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,550
Candor. And I was not going to
read it just because I had a lot

468
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,661
on my plate. And Dan, like, you
kind of brought it up when we

469
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:10,830
were talking about things.

470
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:13,355
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, wasn't
excited about reading. I didn't

471
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,786
know anything about it other
than the title, like, and that's

472
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,391
literally all I knew about it
and I've judged it on the, I did

473
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,996
I

474
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:21,445
judge it on the title? I've
judged the book by its cover. I

475
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:28,715
did it. Uh, but the, um, I got
into the intro and I read the

476
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:33,105
second edition and she actually
talked in the. Intro or forward

477
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,545
or whatever, um, about how she
wished she had chosen a

478
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:35,985
different

479
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:37,710
title. Uh, which was
interesting, but no, I got, I

480
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,434
got through the

481
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:42,016
I'm maybe halfway through the
intro and that's when I texted

482
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,605
you and I was like, Bekah, wait,
you need to read this to you.

483
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:44,775
Like, we need to, you know,
this, this is like, this is what

484
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,945
we

485
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,195
need in, um, in our, in our
lives for the first coffee

486
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,445
stuff. Uh,

487
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:52,185
I, I just need you to appreciate
it. And I appreciated it too.

488
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:53,384
You

489
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,165
know, it's a very good book.

490
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:59,931
Bekah: so good. And it's very,
very useful because I think, you

491
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,111
know, like one of the core
concepts of the book is that

492
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,611
sometimes you don't have those
direct conversations with people

493
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:11,901
because you don't want to hurt
their feelings or you think like

494
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:15,351
they're going to grow on their
own or that they'll recognize

495
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:20,361
those things. And number one,
like you're projecting to that

496
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:24,441
person onto that person, maybe
what you do yourself, but also.

497
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:27,105
You help people grow by being
honest with them and letting

498
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,309
them

499
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,020
know like, okay, yes, we've done
this thing or you've done this

500
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,931
thing. Here's how you can
improve. And you don't fix the

501
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:39,676
mistakes for them. And maybe
this is like a grade school

502
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:42,421
teacher

503
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,176
kind of thing. But I think we
kind of lose us as adults

504
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,931
because

505
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,530
we want to preserve these
relationships with people and

506
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,800
think that by being direct or
like, okay, so I'm projecting on

507
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,701
everybody else. This is what I
think like, oh, well, you know,

508
00:25:56,701 --> 00:26:00,810
I, I don't want them to feel bad
about all of the work that

509
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,760
they've put into something, but
when I'm not direct with people,

510
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:10,651
then sometimes what happens is I
ended up taking on more of the

511
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,061
work. No, no, that's, that's
what happens all of the time.

512
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,471
Right?

513
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,401
Like, and that's not helping
anybody, it's not helping them

514
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:21,421
for sure, because they're not
able to grow in that moment. And

515
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:27,451
so by saying things like, yes,
this is awesome. Well, you know,

516
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,026
you have a lot of reservations
there about the work that

517
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:30,601
they've

518
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:35,550
created. It doesn't allow them
to understand the process. It

519
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,250
doesn't create clear
communication and it certainly

520
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,680
doesn't create trust because
then when they see their work

521
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,110
with a

522
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:47,415
bunch of changes or if you just
don't. Put their work into

523
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:52,336
practice, then it can be really
challenging. And so it's hard to

524
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:55,816
kind of change those ways of
communicating with people. And

525
00:26:56,056 --> 00:27:00,286
for me, I've been trying to do
more of upfront. This is how I

526
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,036
communicate. Sometimes this is
how it comes across and please

527
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,215
feel free to let me know how you
feel about what I'm doing,

528
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:08,730
because you know, I want to be
on the same page as you. I want

529
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,245
to

530
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:13,695
work together. I want to grow
together. And sometimes that

531
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:19,096
works and Dan mentioned Magnolia
JS. And those, I think the first

532
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,576
email that I sent to Kayla after
Gant kind of connect us like

533
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,746
Kayla, this is awesome. This is
how I communicate. And so please

534
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,625
let me know, like if I'm
overstepping boundaries or if

535
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:35,135
we're not communicating in the
way that needs to be, uh, in, in

536
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:37,250
a way that is mutually
productive. But for me right

537
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,355
now,

538
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:46,871
like I'm leaning into that until
I can. Kind of be able to employ

539
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:53,891
those mechanisms or to be
"Radically Candor" in all of the

540
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:58,000
ways that I think are useful to
everyone and helping them grow.

541
00:27:58,211 --> 00:27:59,770
So that, that's my number one
lesson.

542
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:03,615
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I it's
something I've and honestly,

543
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,525
like I've like

544
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:09,826
noticed you improving that, that
sort of, I've noticed you're

545
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:11,020
working on it. I've noticed you
improving, in your

546
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,214
communications

547
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:15,786
with, with everybody, um, and
including me, but I that's

548
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:17,736
something I struggled with you
and I, I don't know that I've

549
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,236
turned the corner so much, but
it's definitely something I'm

550
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:25,226
working on. Uh, another thing
that, um, that I sort of related

551
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:31,455
it, you know, that I've been,
that I both discovered was I was

552
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:34,185
going to say discovered that it
was harder than I thought. And I

553
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,705
think the real answer is more
that I discovered that I never

554
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,700
even thought about it or how,
you know, what I mean is, um,

555
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,695
sort of

556
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:43,635
when you're planning and you're
communicating with, with people,

557
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:48,790
um, if you're going to ask
somebody for help, um, like. You

558
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,320
owe it to them, and to yourself,
um, to, to be sort of specific

559
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:56,431
about everything, maybe not
everything, but specific about,

560
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,595
you know, what help you want,
you know, what, like what help

561
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,729
you

562
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,451
don't want maybe. Um, and Kim
Scott talked about this in

563
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,995
Radical Candor, too, you know,
uh, about laying expectations

564
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,539
for

565
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:09,570
things, you know? Um, so if you
just give somebody a one word

566
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,691
task and say, go, um, you know,
you, I mean, if you're going to

567
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,790
be okay. with whatever comes out
of it, then great. You know what

568
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,580
I mean? Um, but if not, then
it's, you know, it's on you, you

569
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,610
know, on me, on the person
asking to improve that, ahead of

570
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,549
time, I

571
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,641
feel like, and that's something
we've been even struggling with

572
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:36,201
the times here, as well as, um,
that takes work. You know, the,

573
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:41,121
the outlining that stuff takes
time. And, um, time is the thing

574
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:45,111
that we have the least that was,
I mean, that was our first both

575
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:48,080
of our answers for our, uh, our
remote control thing was just

576
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,210
like, all just we need more
time. Um, but anyway, it's so,

577
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,340
so like

578
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:55,340
balancing that with, um, having
to manage day to day stuff, um,

579
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:57,005
and, and everything else has
been interesting. I feel like

580
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,579
we,

581
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:04,401
that, I feel like we are, um,
turning a corner on at Virtual

582
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:08,540
Coffee. We have some great new
teams of people that are helping

583
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,755
out with things. Um, we have
this team that's been going for

584
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:10,970
awhile

585
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,931
that has just been helping on
the coffee events, um, leading,

586
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:18,215
leading breakout rooms and
taking notes. Uh, and, um, it's

587
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:21,079
been

588
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,780
great having a little community
of people that is just like,

589
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,401
that's their, that's the thing
they're working on. And they're

590
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:27,621
excited about it. And, you know,
um, we have like a slack channel

591
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,080
that's just for that. And It's
been, it's been really cool and

592
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,850
we've improved our processes.
Like we did have, we did put

593
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,620
work

594
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,315
into putting things in, you
know, some documentation and

595
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:39,009
stuff like

596
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,855
that ahead of time. Um, but
since people have gotten

597
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,700
involved,

598
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:44,830
we've been able to improve it.
We've seen where things work,

599
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,135
where they don't, you know,
what, when things are confusing

600
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,440
when

601
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:51,971
they're not. Um, and I mean,
that's just one piece of the

602
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,846
whole, the whole pie, but, um,
it's, you know, and this is

603
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,721
like,

604
00:30:55,721 --> 00:31:00,520
we, we think of Virtual Coffee a
lot as, um, an open source

605
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,470
community, you know, like we've,
we've, uh, we've used that

606
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,269
phrase

607
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,351
before. And, I think everybody
realizes that being an open

608
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,961
source maintainer is hard, you
know? I mean, everybody sort of

609
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:14,951
knows it in the back of their
mind, you know, and that like a

610
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,421
lot of the struggles that, and
of course we have, our

611
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,891
documentation

612
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,691
is open source. Our website is
open source. You know, we have

613
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,916
open source projects, um, as
well. Right. And so, uh, A lot

614
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:26,141
of

615
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:29,570
the same things we ended up
having to work through, um, and

616
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,790
it's, it can be hard sometimes,
it can be a really great a lot

617
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,010
of

618
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,921
times, uh, you know, and it's
definitely a learning, you know,

619
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,560
uh, like a very large learning
process. I've never, I've never

620
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:43,820
maintained a large open source
project before. Um, and I've

621
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,100
never been any kind of
community, community organizer,

622
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,380
um, before,

623
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:53,961
so I've been struggling and
learning and, um, uh, you know,

624
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:58,701
over the last I keep saying, I
don't really know how time works

625
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:02,901
anymore. Uh, the last six months
or so months, you know, since,

626
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:05,780
um, since I've been in any sort
of leadership position here and,

627
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,250
um, yeah, it's been hard.
There's been some things where

628
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,660
I've done,

629
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:16,250
you know, and, uh, I, you know,
I just sort of missed, uh, I had

630
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,395
like, I missed, I don't know how
to describe this. I was

631
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,540
surprised

632
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,580
by, uh, you know, I think that
happened, you know what I mean?

633
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,290
And it was just like, uh, the
same kind of thing where it

634
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,471
hadn't occurred to me to think
about yet, you know, you know?

635
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,351
Um, and that happens that that
is, that's a common thing in my

636
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,060
life. Uh, you know, I, I
learned, I learned by, you know,

637
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,769
falling

638
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,840
down, um, most of all and, um,
yeah, I don't really know where

639
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:44,560
it's going there, but there's,
there's been other times where

640
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,750
I've done something that I
thought was just like, oh, this

641
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,770
is kind of cool or whatever, and
they just kind of toss it out

642
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,790
and

643
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,340
it's been, you know, like,
everybody's been very excited

644
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,705
about it too, you know, that
kind of thing. So it's, uh, I

645
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,070
don't

646
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,500
know. It's been, it's been fun.
It's been, it's been, it's been

647
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,930
a

648
00:32:58,931 --> 00:32:59,230
journey.

649
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,290
Bekah: yeah, for sure. Yeah. And
it is interesting to kind of

650
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,600
see,

651
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:07,343
so. I think because we were not
an intentional community to

652
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:10,025
start

653
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:13,236
with some people, you know, I
I've described it in this way.

654
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:19,056
Like, um, well I was talking to
Tom Cudd, I think recently. And

655
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:24,536
he, maybe he, I'm sorry, Tom, if
I am taking this and putting

656
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:28,435
words into your mouth, but in my
mind, what I remember is, um,

657
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,786
Virtual Coffee is kind of like a
social startup, right? And so

658
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:36,175
startups are, we typically think
of them as like move fast and

659
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:39,806
break things. And so I like to
say, like, we move slow and

660
00:33:39,806 --> 00:33:44,006
deliberately here at Virtual
Coffee. Um, we try to at least,

661
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:50,260
because, you know, we're, we're
focused on the people. And if we

662
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,530
talk about what Virtual Coffee
is and what the goals are for

663
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,310
Virtual Coffee, number one in my
mind is never let's grow Virtual

664
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,330
Coffee. Like yeah, that's on the
list. But my number one is let's

665
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,750
support the people who are here
right now and figure out how we

666
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,881
can continue to do that. As we
grow,

667
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:11,085
Dan: Yeah, I

668
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,090
Bekah: just like, looked

669
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:13,036
Dan: know I

670
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,070
Bekah: were going to respond to
that.

671
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:17,085
Dan: well, I was, uh, I mean, I
was agreeing with you, you know,

672
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:22,456
I mean, I, I, uh, that's the,
the, the top of our list is not,

673
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:24,885
none of our lists have at the
top of it, you know, increased

674
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:27,135
growth

675
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:31,005
rate, you know what I mean? Uh,
and like, a lot of that is

676
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:37,036
because we don't have the
incentive to do that. Right. I

677
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:41,896
mean, we, we want, I want more
people to join because I want

678
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,071
them, like the people that
aren't members of Virtual

679
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:46,246
Coffee, like

680
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:48,735
should be members of Virtual
Coffee. You know what I mean?

681
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:50,611
Like, I want that, I want them
to join for them, you know, but

682
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:51,976
we

683
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:53,940
don't have, like the, we're not
a paid community. We're not like

684
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,904
we

685
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:59,246
don't even. Right now have
advertiser, you know, we we've

686
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:02,485
been talking about and sponsors
and stuff like that. And I

687
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:06,445
suppose, um, if you you know,
some company, if you were

688
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:07,810
designing a company around this,
then that would be the

689
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,175
incentive,

690
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:13,376
you know? Um, and that's not
ours. And that's what, like, one

691
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:14,906
of the things, like way, way
back when we first started

692
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,436
talking

693
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,506
about any of this, like first
started talking about like,

694
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:20,576
doing

695
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:25,315
anything beyond the slack, you
know, in the zooms. Um, I don't

696
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:28,856
know who put the line down at
first, but we, we all, I think

697
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:31,525
we're agreed that we're never
going to put content behind a

698
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:36,686
paywall basically. Um, I guess,
I guess this is all to say it to

699
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,576
support what Bekah was saying is
it's like everything that's like

700
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:39,996
high on our list are things to
just improve. Like what are,

701
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,416
what

702
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:45,416
we got going on right now? So we
have things like improve, um,

703
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:49,976
event management, improve, you
know, improve our workflows for

704
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,691
working with teams. And, um, all
of that. stuff is much higher

705
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:55,346
and

706
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:57,746
provide more value to our V to,
to our existing members, you

707
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:59,801
know, as much higher on our
list, then try to open up the

708
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,856
flood

709
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,405
gates and, you know, buy some Ad
Words or whatever. And you know

710
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,640
what I mean? Um, and just
started pumping members in. We

711
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,875
could, I

712
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,406
think, you know what I mean?
Like we, we could make a couple

713
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:11,936
of

714
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:19,166
little changes and, um, increase
our like membership count very

715
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:22,255
quickly if we want to do. I
think, I mean, I'm, I'm not

716
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:24,898
saying like astronomically, but
like we could do that. Um, and.

717
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:27,541
I

718
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,065
think we can. I mean, we don't
have very many members. We have

719
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,580
a

720
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:33,731
couple hundred, I don't remember
what it is right now, active

721
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:39,400
members. And, um, I think if we
just decided right now, like

722
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,800
let's double that we could do
that in like two weeks, probably

723
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,490
honestly. Uh, if that was our
only goal, it's just not, you

724
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,840
know, um,

725
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:50,670
Bekah: for sure. And I think
like, and that's the thing that

726
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,240
like, I keep coming back to, and
sometimes I get super frustrated

727
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,581
with people who are asking about
like, okay, well, what are your

728
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:00,780
metrics? Like I know about
metrics of community building,

729
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:04,351
but I'm not interested in a lot
of them because they don't

730
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:09,181
include so many people. And so
for me, it's about making sure

731
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:12,990
that we get it right for our
people and for people who are

732
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,621
underrepresented. And, you know,
there's a trend in tech that

733
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,190
everybody who talks the loudest
are the people that get hurt.

734
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:24,391
Right. And we have so many
amazing developers and our

735
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:28,951
community at all stages, and
they don't have 40,000 Twitter

736
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,855
followers or whatever, you know,
they participate in the ways

737
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,759
that

738
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,041
are meaningful to them. And
that's like so many systems of

739
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:43,976
judging, like, who are your top
members? They just like focus so

740
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:48,206
much on like, um, I guess,
quantity over quality. I don't

741
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:54,326
know. We had Courtney on earlier
this season and Courtney is not

742
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:58,945
ever going to be the loudest
person in the room, but she

743
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,545
provides so much value to
everything that we're doing at

744
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:08,335
Virtual Coffee, you know, by
mentoring, by, um, you know,

745
00:38:08,335 --> 00:38:12,596
giving talks by supporting other
members and like, that's great.

746
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:17,215
And that's missed in so many
metric systems, but also like.

747
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:23,485
There are valuable community
members who listen, right? Like,

748
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:26,485
why are we placing value? Why
are we saying a community is

749
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:32,146
valuable? Cool. Only if you have
people who are out there, um,

750
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:36,195
speaking in all of the channels
and doing all of the things,

751
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:41,626
right? Like we should not be
discounting the quiet people or

752
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:43,980
the people who just choose to
listen because they, they

753
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,334
deserve

754
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,606
to be served as well. They
deserve to be part of a

755
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:52,696
community. And this is me
getting myself box now. Um, but

756
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:55,786
like,

757
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:59,896
this is, this is how changes are
made, right? Like you allow

758
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:05,596
people to participate as quickly
as slowly as they want to

759
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,948
participate. And you. Say it
like you're a unique human

760
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:10,300
being. You

761
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,260
are doing things in the ways
that are more comfortable to

762
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,220
you. And

763
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:18,481
like, we are here for that. Like
we're not here for that. If in

764
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,081
the future you decide to give a
talk. Right. Like, that's great.

765
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:23,476
If you decided to give a talk,
but also it's great if you

766
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:24,871
decide

767
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:30,121
to be here and, and just listen
the entire time, like that's

768
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:31,651
okay. It's okay for you to be
there with your camera off. It

769
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:33,181
is

770
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:37,411
okay for you to not drop
something in the chat. Um, yeah.

771
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,170
Will be maybe a little bit more
challenging to be interactive,

772
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,190
but maybe that's not what you're
looking for four. And so I don't

773
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,370
know. I feel this like
consistent struggle with that

774
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,550
question of,

775
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,931
well, how has your community
impact people? Because I think

776
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:58,860
that it doesn't quite capture
that and I've been like slowly

777
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,685
working on this Virtual Coffee.
Um, model for community

778
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:04,510
building.

779
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,225
And one of the things that I
have there is that, um, well,

780
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,940
I'll

781
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,371
just read, it says the goal of
Virtual Coffee, the Virtual

782
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,915
Coffee model is to have a
lasting impact on your

783
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,459
community. It's

784
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,911
create ripples that extend far
beyond your community. And so

785
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:23,530
like this idea of ripples to me
is really important because it,

786
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,831
it is, um, supporting people
where they're at and allowing

787
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:32,561
them to feel comfortable in the
ways that they feel comfortable

788
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,710
and then taking that forward in
the ways that are meaningful to

789
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,971
them. And so what's meaningful
to me as not meaningful to every

790
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,945
other person in the community.
And. That, you know, sometimes

791
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:47,485
that requires me to learn a lot
about how other people function,

792
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:50,666
but also to just embrace people.
Like where are you at right now

793
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:52,750
in your journey? And that's
totally okay. And so I think

794
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,415
that

795
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:58,675
personal connection is so
important and also why people

796
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:00,595
say, um, well, you can't scale
or you don't have enough

797
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:02,515
members.

798
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:04,855
Like never, I don't, I don't
need a certain number of members

799
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:07,194
to be

800
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:10,091
meaningful because it's, it's
one person, all I need is one

801
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,146
person

802
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,781
Dan: Yeah. Uh, I mean, I love
all of that and I agree with it,

803
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,521
you

804
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:26,311
know, I mean, w w the, and I
don't know, sort of changing the

805
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:27,525
subject a little bit. Well, not
changing the subject, but

806
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:28,739
related

807
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:34,650
segwaying, I guess. Um, anyway,
the that's one of the struggles

808
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,555
that I've found with learning
about community building and,

809
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,190
um,

810
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:42,581
especially the tooling around
community building is that it's

811
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,061
almost entirely set up on the
premise that you want to make

812
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:51,971
money from your members. Um, w
whether it's, whether it's, uh,

813
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:54,116
you're a company trying to sell,
you know, um, sell things to

814
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:56,231
your

815
00:41:56,231 --> 00:42:00,041
members, or whether it's, you
know, just trying to take, uh,

816
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,960
getting, um, event fees or
membership dues, stuff like

817
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,850
that,

818
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:06,791
making money from your members
directly. And, um, you know,

819
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:10,210
we're not there, right? Like
that's not us at all. Um, and so

820
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:12,880
this is what I was saying before
our, all of our incentives are

821
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,451
different. And the, if your goal
was to make money in some way

822
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:23,501
from your members, then the
incentives are to ignore those,

823
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:24,716
the people, the quiet people, or
the people that aren't, you

824
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:25,811
know,

825
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:29,643
there's a, um, We started using
a service called Orbit, um,

826
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:32,935
which I

827
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:35,096
like a lot actually. Um, but I'm
going to pick on him a little

828
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:36,776
bit, but, uh, one of their, one
of their things, so orbit is,

829
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:38,456
um,

830
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:40,435
sort of a community. I don't
know what to, how to exactly

831
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,024
describe

832
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:45,806
it, but it's a way to, um, to,

833
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:47,115
Bekah: management

834
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:50,545
Dan: yeah, it's not so much for
managing, um, w what it is, is a

835
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:53,545
way to keep an eye on what your
members are doing across your

836
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:54,700
different services. Right? So we
have slack and we have GitHub

837
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,855
and

838
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:59,396
we have Twitter and we have
whatever, and it's hard to know,

839
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:00,970
you know, it's, it's hard to
like, know what people are

840
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,515
doing,

841
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:04,495
um, when it's all spread out
across different services.

842
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:06,384
Right?

843
00:43:06,385 --> 00:43:10,436
And so what Orbit can do is you
can just, um, have one thing and

844
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,670
then add your services in, and
you can, uh, and then it'll

845
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,875
track

846
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,440
events and, and say where they
happened and who did them. And

847
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,004
it

848
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:23,365
will sort of identify, you know,
or you can add them in. But, uh,

849
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:27,331
so if we have a member, um, I
can usually find on orbit there,

850
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:28,821
their Twitter and their GitHub,
you know, and their slack are

851
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,311
all

852
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:34,150
like in one person, you know? So
you can see if, oh, this person

853
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:36,940
commented on slack and then, oh,
they liked something on Twitter,

854
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,820
that sort of thing. But one of
the things that I don't like is

855
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,840
they have a metric called
"reach" and that is all what you

856
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,860
were

857
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,951
talking about before. was the
high, um, Twitter followers, you

858
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,661
know, uh, that sort of thing.
And that's like, that's a metric

859
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,371
I'm

860
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:53,021
not interested in at all, for
Virtual Coffee, um, I would be

861
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:57,161
interested in it if I was
incentivized to, you know, like,

862
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,245
like I was saying, like, if
those are the like orbit is

863
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:01,030
trying to

864
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,130
say, those are the high value,
um, members, but we knew, we

865
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,230
just

866
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:09,521
know that that's not, um, you
know, that that's not true for

867
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:14,240
us. Right. Uh, I mean, my, I
don't know. I have, like, I have

868
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,635
a followers on Twitter, you
know, I'm not even saying that I

869
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:17,010
value,

870
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,291
but like, man, remember, but you
know what I mean? Like it's just

871
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,433
like, not, not a thing. We
don't, we don't. It's great. If

872
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,575
people

873
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,716
want to talk about Virtual
Coffee on Twitter or whatever,

874
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:25,856
to their

875
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:28,405
friends, uh, when do you want
people to do that? If they want

876
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:31,210
to, you know? Um, but not
because we want to make more

877
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,015
money, if

878
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:37,916
that makes any sense, you know?
Um, and so like, that's, that's

879
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,885
been a struggle with that. All
the, a lot of the, um, event

880
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:44,306
management stuff is, you know,
sort of based around ticket

881
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,695
sales, um, things like that. Um,
community management stuff is

882
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:54,025
like a cheap, you know, free
tier. And then after that, it's

883
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,180
like, they're taking a
percentage of your member dues,

884
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,335
for

885
00:44:56,335 --> 00:44:58,626
instance, you know, we just know
we're not gonna have member dues

886
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:02,485
ever, you know, so I don't know.
It's, it's been, it's been

887
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:02,965
interesting.

888
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:06,605
Bekah: Yeah. I mean this idea
of, I mean, we're not, we're

889
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:09,029
losing

890
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,990
money on Virtual Coffee, right?
Like we're paying things out of

891
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,880
our pockets and we're taking
time out of our day. But also

892
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,770
like,

893
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,670
what we want to do is, you know,
support people where they're at,

894
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,331
especially so many people that
have come to Virtual Coffee have

895
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:28,440
said things like, I never felt
like I belong to a community

896
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,300
until this one. Right. And I
would, I'm going to just guess

897
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:41,141
that our average age is about.
35 ish, metal, thirties. Yeah.

898
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:43,515
Anyway, that's me. And also
same. Like, I never really felt

899
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:45,779
like I

900
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,565
belonged to a community before
this. And it's just so nice to

901
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:49,350
be

902
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,105
able to have such a diverse
group of people. And we've gone

903
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:52,859
back

904
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,771
and forth about like what
expansion for Virtual Coffee

905
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,736
means. And like, should you be
able to have Virtual Coffee

906
00:45:57,736 --> 00:45:59,701
React

907
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:04,800
or Virtual Coffee? Um, that
belongs to a particular group of

908
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,310
people. And I think, you know,
like it depends, but also what

909
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,820
we

910
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,770
love so much is the diversity of
people, people being at

911
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,720
different

912
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:19,740
stages, people being here to
support each other. And so, you

913
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,041
know, when people ask me like,
okay, well, if you had to choose

914
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,670
a metric, what would you choose?
And like, well, authentic

915
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:28,726
connection. So go ahead and
figure out how you describe

916
00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:30,721
that.

917
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,403
But I like one of the things.
People ask questions in slack

918
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:36,055
and

919
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:38,530
they get a response, right.
There is almost never a time

920
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,004
where

921
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:43,735
nobody gets a response. Um,

922
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,221
Dan: And one of the, this was, I
had thought about this before,

923
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,561
but one of the things that
happens with that is that I love

924
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:50,910
is, Um, lots of times there's
the response is:"I'm not really

925
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,259
sure.

926
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,615
Let's jump on a zoom and talk",
you know? Uh, and it's just,

927
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:56,939
it's

928
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,920
not a Virtual Coffee official
thing, you know, it's just one

929
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,041
member talking to another member
and th they just throw a zoom

930
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,590
link in and they're like, Hey,
let's, let's go talk. yeah. And,

931
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,411
um, that almost always works out
too.

932
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,070
Bekah: Yeah. And I want to say,
like, you know, as I'm working

933
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,435
through my own Virtual Coffee
model of doing things like

934
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:13,800
there,

935
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,061
there are two major tenants
here, right? And there's this

936
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:18,291
idea,

937
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,661
this is, this is my idea of like
a person centered approach, I

938
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:24,751
think is kind of what I've been
talking about this entire time

939
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:27,630
and why it's so important to
recognize each person where

940
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,787
they're at, but also like there
there's this. Second part of

941
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:31,944
like

942
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:33,895
the tools and the structures
that are there in place to

943
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,814
support the

944
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:39,985
people. And so you can see each
person individually and you can

945
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,605
recognize them, but if you don't
have support in the tools, in

946
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,225
the

947
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:46,795
structures, you're not going to
get very far. And Dan, I know

948
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:50,786
like you've worked so hard on
that. And the, the co-working

949
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:54,896
room especially has just like
taken off as one of the most

950
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:58,735
important things I think we've
ever done in Virtual Coffee. So,

951
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:02,635
um, if you want to just give an
overview of the coworking room

952
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:03,715
or, you know,

953
00:48:04,335 --> 00:48:06,690
Dan: yeah. yeah. Excuse me. This
was another, um, this was

954
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,045
another

955
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,180
instance of, um, our members
were just doing this, like. On

956
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,225
their

957
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,161
own, um, just posting in
whatever general or, you know,

958
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,096
just

959
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:19,826
posting in slack. Hey, um, I'm
just working, just sitting here

960
00:48:19,826 --> 00:48:22,346
working if anybody wants to work
with me and posting that zoom

961
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:26,275
link, you know, from their own
Zoom. Um, and they're just doing

962
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:29,396
that often and it seems like
people were, um, enjoying doing

963
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:35,275
that, you know? And, um, we
talked about, I don't remember

964
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:39,536
who shoot, I'm sorry. I can't
remember. Who's somebody shared

965
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:41,635
an article about a way that
somebody had done this before

966
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:46,766
with Zoom and, um, who's Joshua,
uh, sorry,

967
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:46,846
Bekah: of

968
00:48:47,195 --> 00:48:48,225
Dan: I'm gonna, I'm going to
have to look it up. I'm gonna

969
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,255
have to

970
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:51,925
look it up. Cause I wrote it
down, um, a while ago. Um, but

971
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,595
so

972
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:57,226
so yeah, so we thought, um, well
let's, maybe we can just make a

973
00:48:57,226 --> 00:49:00,206
coworking room. That's just like
basically a conference room, um,

974
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:01,855
that people can go in and work
and leave and whatever, you

975
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,475
know,

976
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:10,240
no pressure. No, no. Um, you
know, I don't know. Yeah, no

977
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,920
expectations, you know, and, um,
and it turns out you can. And so

978
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,240
like one of them, one of, I mean
like, so, so this is combined,

979
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:23,621
um, a bunch of different, a few
different services, uh, but, um,

980
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:28,181
in zoom and we can, you can
create a, uh, sort of ongoing

981
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:29,456
recurring meeting. So it's
actually really funny. It's,

982
00:49:29,456 --> 00:49:30,731
it's

983
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:33,130
a recurring meeting and it
recurs at any select, uh, "no

984
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,529
particular

985
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:41,380
time," right? So this is a
meeting that has the same ID or

986
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,775
whatever, you know, it's the
same meeting, but it has a bunch

987
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:44,170
of

988
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,231
instances that just start when
somebody joins and stops when

989
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,610
they leave. Um, cause that's
what we wanted. We wanted to be

990
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,989
able

991
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,170
to, to have members join. Um, we
wanted to not have to have a

992
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,030
host, you know, cause that's one
of the struggles we have with,

993
00:49:55,061 --> 00:49:57,190
um, other, other events, right.
Is, uh, having to have a

994
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,319
licensed

995
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,221
user, be a host to start them
into two controls, but for the

996
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,738
coworking room, um, you know
that we did, we didn't. We

997
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:08,255
wanted

998
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,320
members to be able to start
them. Right. And so obviously

999
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,385
you can

1000
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:16,405
have, uh, zoom meetings have
people joined before the host.

1001
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:18,311
Uh, and so what we ended up
doing is creating a licensed

1002
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:20,186
user that

1003
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:24,485
is just a bot that is just like,
not any person. Right. And, that

1004
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,105
user just has one meeting. It's
just this meeting and that

1005
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:27,694
person

1006
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,750
is not a person, right. That
user never joins, never logs in

1007
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,174
never

1008
00:50:31,175 --> 00:50:32,705
does anything, but, um, they
just own that meeting. And so

1009
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:34,235
when

1010
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:38,255
somebody has the link and they
join, then a new instance starts

1011
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:40,175
and then people can join. And
then when the last person

1012
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:42,004
leaves,

1013
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,075
that instance ends, um, and then
to tie that into slack, you

1014
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,145
know,

1015
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:52,715
we want it to, um, like creating
the room was, was cool. We did

1016
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:55,985
want to have some, it, you know,
the, the next part was like

1017
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:59,601
letting people know when people.
were in the room or not. Right.

1018
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:00,680
Cause there's no way to do that
with zoom. There's no way to

1019
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,759
just

1020
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,880
like look. Um, and, and so we, I
ended up, uh, zoom has, you

1021
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,000
know,

1022
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,400
web hooks are and, um, slack,
you know, we created a slack

1023
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,770
app, um,

1024
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,885
awhile ago, Mike Rogers like
was, was, was the one that

1025
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:16,910
pushing

1026
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,921
that like pushing the slack app.
Um, you know, when we started,

1027
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,931
we

1028
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,490
have the slack app, uh, does
like event notifications, stuff

1029
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,049
like

1030
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,791
that. And so we use that slack
app to, um, between the zoom web

1031
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:32,570
hooks, the slack app, and, um,
Netlify functions, uh, basically

1032
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,201
notifying our slack room. We, we
created a coworking room and

1033
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:40,161
then, um, notifying that room
when the room opens and closes,

1034
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:41,841
you know, when people join and
leave that kind of thing. Um,

1035
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:43,521
and

1036
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,940
it was, it was kind of fun. I
have a blog post that is a.

1037
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,340
Planned and not at all written
about this, about this, you

1038
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,990
know,

1039
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,570
the technical details of this,
because it was kind of fun, but,

1040
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:57,561
um, but yeah, so, uh, and people
have been using it pretty

1041
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:58,840
regularly. Very

1042
00:51:58,925 --> 00:52:00,996
Bekah: All the time. It's
constant. They're constantly

1043
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:01,775
people in there.

1044
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,490
Dan: We, uh, we, I do wish that
you could do, there's no way to

1045
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,050
do breakout rooms, um, which is
a bummer. Uh, it would be nice

1046
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,610
to

1047
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:11,230
cause, cause sometimes, you
know, people are, it's like, if

1048
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,819
you

1049
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,061
imagine you're in a room, you
know, in a co-working real life

1050
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:18,101
room working with somebody and
you're like, want to have like a

1051
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,710
chat about something like, okay,
let's go step over here and talk

1052
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,260
to me. Don't bother everybody.
Um, I wish we could do that. Uh,

1053
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,240
unfortunately there's no
breakout room control right now

1054
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,220
in zoom,

1055
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,001
um, through the

1056
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:31,885
Bekah: feel like the, the, like
the, um, easy way to do that is

1057
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:35,335
just mute. Like if people come
into the room and they're chatty

1058
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:37,945
and you're working just

1059
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,471
Dan: you can just mute. Yeah,
sure, sure. But then you won't

1060
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:44,621
know when the conversation
stopped, whatever to you it's

1061
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:47,106
like. The breakout rooms would
be cool. It's not like a deal

1062
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:49,505
breaker. Obviously people are
using the coworking room a lot,

1063
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:51,906
um, and, and seem to enjoy it.
So that's been kind of fun. I

1064
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:54,186
don't

1065
00:52:54,186 --> 00:52:56,240
know if this is a thing that
would grow our members. Like,

1066
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,294
you

1067
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:02,465
know, if we were focused on, on
profits or whatever, um, I don't

1068
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,085
think this would have ever
happened or it would be on the

1069
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:06,155
bottom of the list, you know?
Um, but since our members were

1070
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:08,225
doing

1071
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,865
it already and then our kind of
goal is to support them, it was,

1072
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,531
it was a pretty easy choice, um,
to just kind of go and set it

1073
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:14,166
up,

1074
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,706
um, spent a couple days on it.
Yeah,

1075
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:19,184
Bekah: Yeah, I mean, it's been
nice. I wish I can spend more

1076
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:21,343
time in the coworking room. Like
I just low key hover over and

1077
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:23,502
see

1078
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:26,023
like, oh, they're all in there
having fun without me. So

1079
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:28,543
there's

1080
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,868
some FOMO there, but, um, I
think it's been nice to be able

1081
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:33,193
to go

1082
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:37,213
in and I've been in both
situations where I come in and

1083
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,844
somebody is working quietly and
they say like, well, this is

1084
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:43,793
where I'm at in my Pomodoro
session or, or whatever. You

1085
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:47,603
know, like, okay, cool. I can
work. And then there are other

1086
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:52,733
times where I just start talking
to people or they start talking

1087
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:56,903
to me and we just deep dive into
things that I want to be able to

1088
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,313
talk about with community
members, but just don't have

1089
00:53:58,313 --> 00:53:59,723
that

1090
00:53:59,724 --> 00:54:05,393
opportunity to all the time. And
it's been really, really nice to

1091
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:08,423
have those conversations and to
be able to think about like,

1092
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:12,773
okay, like, you know, how do we
keep moving this forward? How do

1093
00:54:12,773 --> 00:54:15,848
we keep pushing? How do we do
things that people need, and

1094
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:18,923
that

1095
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,503
are not being done right now, or
at least like, not in ways that

1096
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:24,083
I

1097
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,408
can see. So it's, it's been
really, really nice to be able

1098
00:54:26,408 --> 00:54:28,733
to

1099
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:35,153
have that. And I think like two
in one way, or looking through

1100
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:36,458
these things, or we're talking
about community and we're

1101
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,763
talking

1102
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:42,893
about code and we're talking
about tools, um, There's this

1103
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:47,333
like very fine balance of
automation of things, right?

1104
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:50,453
Like, um, I was in this
community building conference

1105
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,542
recently and,

1106
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,884
or maybe it was made up, I don't
know, whatever. And they were

1107
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:57,878
talking about, oh, well we
automate all of these things,

1108
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,872
man

1109
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:07,373
or not, man. Wow. That feels
really impersonal. You're asking

1110
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:09,938
people to give of themselves
personally in their responses

1111
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:12,503
and

1112
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:14,813
you are collecting that data,
very impersonally. And to me

1113
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:17,063
that

1114
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:21,893
just, just doesn't quite match
up. And I think that's just in

1115
00:55:21,893 --> 00:55:25,284
general, like a problem with
tech, but something that we try

1116
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:31,974
and figure out like that balance
of automating things to make it

1117
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:38,333
easier on a very small team of
volunteers. But also recognizing

1118
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:41,753
that like the personal
interaction is super important.

1119
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:48,864
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um,
you know, there's. I mean, yeah,

1120
00:55:48,893 --> 00:55:50,108
we we've stepped into the
automating stuff and, another

1121
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:51,323
one

1122
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:56,034
of the challenges, um, is since
we're a developer community, you

1123
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:58,974
know, everybody, everybody gets
very excited about, um, wanting

1124
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:03,023
to help and wanting to have, uh,
and having ideas and things like

1125
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:07,793
that. And, um, and I love it,
but it's like, it's, it's never,

1126
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:12,054
there's so many moving pieces,
you know? Uh, and it's, uh, I

1127
00:56:12,054 --> 00:56:16,103
don't know, it's not always
simple. Um, or, you know, if you

1128
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:18,923
have one event or one problem,
you're like, oh, here's an easy

1129
00:56:18,923 --> 00:56:21,143
fix for this. Right. But it, it
kind of all kind of cascades

1130
00:56:21,143 --> 00:56:23,603
together. And the other side of
that is that every single

1131
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:26,063
service

1132
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:27,428
that's out there I'm like, that
makes it makes things easy.

1133
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:28,793
Like,

1134
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:33,233
like Zapier is Zapier as a cool
service. Um, but it's so

1135
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:35,033
expensive. Um, if you want other
people to help and that's how

1136
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:36,833
all

1137
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,923
of these, all of the, uh, all of
the, like no code and stuff is

1138
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:42,623
set up for that. Right. So
they're set up to like pull in,

1139
00:56:42,623 --> 00:56:44,678
um, somebody who's just working
solo. Right. But then they

1140
00:56:44,678 --> 00:56:46,733
assume

1141
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:49,793
that if you're, if you have a
team that you're like a startup

1142
00:56:49,793 --> 00:56:53,693
that has like, started up and
have money coming in, um, and

1143
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:56,164
that's not, obviously not the
case, um, for us. And so that,

1144
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:58,733
that's another struggle too, is,
is, uh, trying to find services

1145
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:00,788
that we can add. Like have
people help, you know, I can't

1146
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:02,843
add any,

1147
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:04,013
like, we have a couple of things
happening on Zapier and, um,

1148
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:05,153
I've

1149
00:57:05,153 --> 00:57:09,233
been trying to get off of it
because of this. Um, and I can

1150
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:14,423
literally, like, my choices are
to pay a large amount of money

1151
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:16,268
that we can't like, I'm not
going to do, um, to add people

1152
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:18,113
to a

1153
00:57:18,114 --> 00:57:22,014
team, you know, or, um, share my
password, which like, I don't

1154
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:24,923
really, we don't tell anybody,
but we do this on a couple of

1155
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:28,403
services and it's not fun. It's
like a pain, you know? Uh, so

1156
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:30,226
it's. That's. I mean, that's
another part, like that's

1157
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:31,478
another

1158
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:33,308
struggle too. And so we, we
we've actually been on the tool

1159
00:57:33,308 --> 00:57:35,138
side.

1160
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:43,159
Um, I have been working on some
in-house some in-house tools to,

1161
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,328
uh, solve some of these
problems, you know, and, and

1162
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:45,497
build on top

1163
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:50,509
of that. Um, and that's, that's
kinda fun too. I I'm going to be

1164
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,778
doing a preview, I think in a
couple of weeks. Like we're not

1165
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:57,768
quite there yet, you know? Um,
but to get off of some of the

1166
00:57:57,768 --> 00:58:01,278
extra services that we're using,
um, and use our own stuff, um,

1167
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,168
will help us, because it'll
solve our own problems and, you

1168
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,608
know,

1169
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:07,458
scratch our own itches or
whatever, but it'll also, um, be

1170
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,909
cool because we can open source
parts of it and, get the

1171
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:13,239
community involved, um, things
like that too. So that's, uh,

1172
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:18,083
that that's coming up, uh, some
sometime in the next. Whatever,

1173
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:20,753
I'm not making any promises. So
it's coming.

1174
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:24,653
Bekah: Well, and it's, it's a
challenge like to be at this

1175
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:30,623
stage. I think of growing where,
like, there are lots of ways to

1176
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:36,054
do things when you're really
small. And like, I don't want to

1177
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,824
say we're middle because we're
not, we're not really middle,

1178
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:39,594
but

1179
00:58:39,594 --> 00:58:43,134
where we're at this point where
there, we certainly feel those

1180
00:58:43,134 --> 00:58:46,583
growing pains. And so it's like
it's with tooling, but also we

1181
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,623
have a lot of people that are
excited and want to help. And

1182
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:52,313
that's great. We love that. But
also we know that that's a

1183
00:58:52,313 --> 00:58:55,824
challenge too, because when you
are onboarding new people to

1184
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:59,844
help, like you're onboarding
them and you, there has to be

1185
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:02,873
processes set up, there has to
be structures set up, right.

1186
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:07,224
Otherwise, it's not going to go
bad. It's not going to go, well,

1187
00:59:07,434 --> 00:59:09,053
it's going to go badly. Like
you're, everybody's going to

1188
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:10,672
feel

1189
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:16,403
let down in that situation. And
so those growing pains of like,

1190
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:19,313
okay, like there's tools that we
wanna be able to use, but we

1191
00:59:19,313 --> 00:59:22,324
can't use these as a team. And
also like, hey, we want to be

1192
00:59:22,704 --> 00:59:24,234
able to onboard new team
members, but we have to be able

1193
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:25,764
to have

1194
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:30,503
these things set up for them.
Otherwise we're not setting them

1195
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,933
up to succeed. We're not setting
them up as partners, as

1196
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:35,332
teammates

1197
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:40,193
or in a way that allows them to
understand like, okay, like what

1198
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,893
is the goal? And can we
accomplish this thing? And so

1199
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:46,344
like when you're in that like
middle spot that we're in now

1200
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:51,653
that it requires just so much
work and effort to be able to

1201
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:55,643
support people and like yeah,
long term, it's going to be

1202
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,953
better if we're able to do those
things. But like right now in

1203
00:59:57,953 --> 01:00:00,263
the

1204
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:05,574
midst of it, it is a challenge
because like, like we said, in

1205
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:08,574
our random check-in question,
there's just not enough time in

1206
01:00:08,574 --> 01:00:12,324
the day to be able to do all of
the things that we want to be

1207
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:16,989
doing with the knowledge and
understanding we have of who our

1208
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:21,608
community members are and being
able to support them in the ways

1209
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:24,323
that they want to support us.
And so it's, um, it's a good

1210
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:27,038
problem

1211
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,748
to have for sure. But also it's
something, again that like we're

1212
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:36,338
working really deliberately to
do, to be able to empower all of

1213
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:43,148
these people in for them to, um,
be able to succeed in, in what

1214
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:44,993
we're handing off to them or
what they're, we're asking them

1215
01:00:44,993 --> 01:00:46,838
to do

1216
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:50,619
to support us. And so that's,
it's just like the, the middle

1217
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:55,329
ground of growing pains. I think
of that's where we're at.

1218
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:56,969
Dan: Yeah.

1219
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:57,509
Bekah: think we're at

1220
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:00,568
Dan: Yeah, no, I agree. I agree
with that. You know, it's.

1221
01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:03,433
Bekah: we're 11 years old.
That's the growing pain age. I

1222
01:01:03,433 --> 01:01:05,488
got an 11

1223
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:08,429
year old. That's how it feels.
And a little smelly.

1224
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:16,514
Dan: Fair enough. Um, the, yeah,
I mean, I, I agree though, it's,

1225
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:21,523
it's, we're in an interesting
phase, um, you know, but it's

1226
01:01:21,523 --> 01:01:22,903
exciting too, you know, we've
just created some of these

1227
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:24,283
teams,

1228
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:29,264
um, to do some cool stuff. I'm,
I'm very excited to see how that

1229
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:34,364
goes. Um, we, you know, we have
a, an ideas team, you know, I

1230
01:01:34,364 --> 01:01:35,684
think that we started, right.

1231
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:36,673
Bekah: we, we do have the

1232
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:41,233
Dan: yeah, we kicked it off.
Cool. And a, um, but what are,

1233
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:43,034
what are the teams that we do
with the monthly, the monthly

1234
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:43,393
challenge

1235
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:46,963
Bekah: monthly challenge team is
rocking it right now. So shout

1236
01:01:46,963 --> 01:01:49,664
out to all those people because
you're amazing

1237
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:52,704
Dan: Um, but it took a long time
to get to that point. You know,

1238
01:01:52,704 --> 01:01:54,038
we we'd been wanting to do it.
We started talking about teams

1239
01:01:54,038 --> 01:01:55,372
in

1240
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:56,843
like, exactly like this, except
well, yeah. months and months

1241
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:58,252
and

1242
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:03,153
months ago. And, um, we had a
couple false starts and, um, I,

1243
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:04,884
you know, I mean the only thing
to do from that is learned.

1244
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:08,213
Right. And, um, we have, you
know, and I feel, I feel really

1245
01:02:08,213 --> 01:02:10,568
good about, uh, you know, about
like, about what's going on

1246
01:02:10,568 --> 01:02:12,923
right

1247
01:02:12,923 --> 01:02:14,363
now. Um, and, and the direction
we're moving forward. I feel

1248
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,803
like

1249
01:02:15,804 --> 01:02:17,738
it's a little bit of a new
phase, you know? So, um, I don't

1250
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:19,672
know.

1251
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:20,213
I'm excited.

1252
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:26,204
Bekah: 2.5. Oh, how that works?

1253
01:02:26,853 --> 01:02:29,454
Dan: I don't, I, it, isn't a
major version of, I feel like

1254
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,773
it's still just a minor version
now,

1255
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:33,193
Bekah: We're in the middle. I
feel like the Hacktoberfest for

1256
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:37,003
me, like kicked off Virtual
Coffee 2.0, and we're

1257
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:38,153
Dan: Yeah. So

1258
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:40,333
Bekah: halfway to next version.

1259
01:02:40,643 --> 01:02:41,603
Dan: that's, that's another
thing I was going to say that

1260
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:42,563
I'm

1261
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:45,054
excited. Speaking of things I'm
excited about is, I mean, it's,

1262
01:02:45,204 --> 01:02:46,756
it's still. Farther away a
little bit, but like it's

1263
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:48,308
getting closer

1264
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,998
and closer is Hacktoberfest and,
and, and, you know, we don't

1265
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:51,687
have

1266
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:56,429
any specific new plans, um, for
that yet, but we have had some

1267
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,938
ideas pop up and, um, I'm like,
I am, I'm pumped up. The

1268
01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:01,708
Hacktoberfest was a blast last
year and for, for Virtual

1269
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,478
Coffee.

1270
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:07,978
Um, and for anybody who doesn't
know, this is, um, oh shoot. Who

1271
01:03:07,978 --> 01:03:09,929
does, um, who does

1272
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:12,588
Bekah: Digital Ocean and Dev I
think

1273
01:03:13,048 --> 01:03:15,838
Dan: and Dev is partnering with
them. Okay.

1274
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:16,699
Bekah: last year.

1275
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:18,343
Dan: Well, either way, um, you
know, they've done that for

1276
01:03:18,343 --> 01:03:19,618
years

1277
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:21,659
and, um, we sort of thought it
would be cool to get our

1278
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:23,639
members,

1279
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,859
you know, involved. Um, and it
was cool. It was so much fun

1280
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:28,079
last

1281
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,278
year. And, uh, I think this
year's gonna be even even

1282
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:30,477
better.

1283
01:03:30,478 --> 01:03:33,358
So that's another thing I'm
excited about that is on the

1284
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:34,978
near, near horizon for us.

1285
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:38,389
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. It is.
It's October about like, we're

1286
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:41,389
already talking about it now,
which is nice. Like last year

1287
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,949
when we were doing Virtual
Coffee, Virtual Coffee started

1288
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,509
in

1289
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:47,088
April. So at this point I
thought like we would be done by

1290
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:49,608
the time

1291
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:54,708
summer rolls around and then we
were not done and we're still

1292
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:59,179
going today. And so like, it's
nice to be able to think like,

1293
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,669
this is what we did last year
and this is how we can preplan

1294
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:03,199
for

1295
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,608
all of these things. So it's,
you know, last year we started

1296
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:09,978
planning Hacktoberfest and it
was amazing. But now like

1297
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:12,348
knowing

1298
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:16,699
we're going to do Hacktoberfest
again, it's just extra exciting

1299
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:22,068
because I know we have so much
time to work through some plans

1300
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:25,489
and ideas and to do these
things.

1301
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:31,364
Dan: it's gonna be awesome. Um,
another thing that our community

1302
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:33,563
members have been doing on their
own, that we've been enjoying

1303
01:04:33,563 --> 01:04:35,708
watching, uh, is, is something
that we, we eventually

1304
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,853
identified

1305
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:41,603
as interest groups. Right. Um,
but this, this is our members.

1306
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:43,993
Um, there's been a few different
ones where members have

1307
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:46,352
basically

1308
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:49,083
started talking about something
that they're interested in and

1309
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,288
then, um, started doing more
regular meetings with people,

1310
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,493
um,

1311
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,074
things like that because other
people weren't interested too.

1312
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:59,583
Right. And so we have, um, Marie
has been doing a tech interview

1313
01:04:59,614 --> 01:05:03,184
study group. Um, and it's been
awesome. Like there's been so

1314
01:05:03,184 --> 01:05:04,714
many people that have been, um,
I feel, I feel like I've gotten

1315
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:06,244
a

1316
01:05:06,244 --> 01:05:08,873
lot of value in, you know, um,
and they've made some friends,

1317
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:12,153
things like that, you know? Um,
Karen's been running the book

1318
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:15,844
club and we were talking about
before. Um, that's been amazing.

1319
01:05:15,903 --> 01:05:18,318
Um, Ray has been just like
killing it with, uh, he's

1320
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:20,733
created

1321
01:05:20,733 --> 01:05:23,178
a, uh, React sort of help
support group and, um, also an,

1322
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:25,623
uh, an

1323
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:28,773
indie hackers. Um, I don't know
what you want to call it support

1324
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:31,998
group as well. Um, And that's
been a really cool thing to

1325
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:34,248
watch. It's been cool thing to
watch happen. It's it's been

1326
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:35,703
something that we've been trying
to figure out how to support,

1327
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:37,158
um,

1328
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:38,703
while not getting in the way or
anything like that. So right

1329
01:05:38,703 --> 01:05:40,068
now,

1330
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:42,978
uh, these, these, our members
are doing are doing these all on

1331
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:45,699
their own, you know, and it's
very cool to see

1332
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:49,708
Bekah: Yeah, it's been really
nice to also be able to go in

1333
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,679
there and listen to the things
that they have to say and to

1334
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:57,748
learn from them. And, you know,
in, in those groups too, I'm

1335
01:05:57,748 --> 01:06:02,153
going to just like, Go back to
the soap box on metrics of

1336
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:04,823
community building, because Ray
has been here for awhile and

1337
01:06:04,823 --> 01:06:07,493
he's

1338
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:10,583
watched things and Karen too,
um, Marie's been pretty active

1339
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:13,672
since

1340
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:17,153
the beginning, but we have
members that have been here for

1341
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:21,293
awhile and just took these
initiatives and went with them.

1342
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:24,534
Right. And so if you look at
traditional metrics of how

1343
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:26,903
communities are measured, I
think that, um, some of these

1344
01:06:26,903 --> 01:06:29,272
falls

1345
01:06:29,273 --> 01:06:32,378
through the cracks and they are
not weighted as high in points

1346
01:06:32,378 --> 01:06:35,483
as

1347
01:06:35,483 --> 01:06:38,994
other people. And this is like,
this is the whole thing. Why

1348
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:44,918
these systems are not great or
they're. Not open to people at

1349
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:48,369
different stages of where they
are, because sometimes it takes

1350
01:06:48,398 --> 01:06:51,878
like sitting back and listening.
Sometimes it takes a moment in

1351
01:06:51,878 --> 01:06:55,838
your life to open up to these
opportunities, to be able to do

1352
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,639
these really great things that
are impacting so many members of

1353
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:03,758
the community. And like, yeah,
they are, would be weighted

1354
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:06,607
right

1355
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,573
now in this moment. But prior to
doing these things, you know,

1356
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:10,538
we,

1357
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:16,719
we have quieter members and I
that's like a totally valid and

1358
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,559
great place to be because the
value should be placed on like

1359
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,119
what you're getting from the
community, not what the

1360
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:23,679
community

1361
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,239
is getting from you. And I know
like I've learned so much from

1362
01:07:28,688 --> 01:07:33,099
each one of these members and I
couldn't. You know, possibly I

1363
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:36,759
like try to say how much I've
learned from them. And I try and

1364
01:07:36,759 --> 01:07:39,668
talk about how amazing they are
and the words just can not

1365
01:07:39,668 --> 01:07:45,398
capture how I feel about them as
people and what they're doing.

1366
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,918
Like they're just amazing.

1367
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:53,759
Dan: Yeah. I absolutely agree.
I've started talking to, um, the

1368
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,528
members that are doing these
kinds of things, you know, to

1369
01:07:55,528 --> 01:08:00,329
learn just a bit, um, is, is how
we can support them, how we can

1370
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:02,278
make it so that they can do this
easier or whatever, or how we

1371
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,227
can

1372
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:05,998
make it, um,if another member
has something similar that they

1373
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,768
want

1374
01:08:07,768 --> 01:08:10,128
to do, you know, but don't have
the tools, maybe we can come up

1375
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:13,188
with some sort of process, you
know, um, to, to allow that to

1376
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:16,939
happen with less friction or, or
just, you know, less, less

1377
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:19,038
worrying about the details, you
know, and, and more just

1378
01:08:19,038 --> 01:08:22,309
concentrating on the good stuff,
right? The actual talking, the

1379
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:24,418
interactions, the learning stuff
like that.

1380
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,599
Bekah: And I think that leans
into the authenticity of the

1381
01:08:27,599 --> 01:08:30,899
group, you know, like these
things just come about naturally

1382
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,948
Virtual Coffee happened
naturally. And like, if you look

1383
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:39,399
five years this is part of it,
you know, just being able to

1384
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,874
support people and what they
want to bring to the

1385
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:44,349
organization and

1386
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:47,979
like, yeah, that makes it
challenging because you're.

1387
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:55,144
Constantly pivoting, but if
you're not, then I don't know

1388
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:56,778
what kind of community that is.
I mean, it's not really a

1389
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:58,412
community

1390
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:02,913
that, that I would be a part of
because I like that idea of

1391
01:09:02,913 --> 01:09:09,873
growing and learning from each
other and being able to go with

1392
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:13,594
what the community brings and
support them where they're at.

1393
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:17,658
Dan: yeah. no, that's an
interesting point, you know? And

1394
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:20,078
I, I don't feel like we've been
constantly pivoting, we've been

1395
01:09:20,078 --> 01:09:23,019
doing course corrections. Um, I
feel like that's a little closer

1396
01:09:23,019 --> 01:09:26,918
to, to what we've been doing and
that's part of, and that's part

1397
01:09:26,918 --> 01:09:29,319
of, one of the challenges that
we've you and I personally like

1398
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:31,613
specifically have struggled
with, right. Is sometimes, you

1399
01:09:31,613 --> 01:09:33,337
know,

1400
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,338
how far do we steer one way or
the other, do we steer at all?

1401
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:40,088
Right. Like that sort of thing.
And I, you know, I know I've had

1402
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,483
long nights where I've just
been, I don't know, stressed

1403
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:42,878
about

1404
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:48,418
that, or, you know, like
community members want people

1405
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,269
like want us to even be steering
at all, you know, that sort of

1406
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:52,948
thing. And I mean, I say
steering is, I'm just like

1407
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:54,627
leaning really

1408
01:09:54,628 --> 01:09:57,719
hard into this metaphor because
there's it cause it's easy to

1409
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:00,828
talk about. But, I personally
feel like we've done a good job,

1410
01:10:00,889 --> 01:10:05,179
you know, w with this overall,
and that doesn't mean like, we

1411
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:06,318
have definitely made missteps
too, you know, along the way.

1412
01:10:06,318 --> 01:10:07,457
Um,

1413
01:10:08,088 --> 01:10:12,479
and it's been. You know, th th
this is why I'm so excited about

1414
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,218
the interest groups for
instance, is, uh, that it's like

1415
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:15,957
a very

1416
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:18,598
clear, like, signal, like, Hey,
steer this way, you know, um,

1417
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:21,238
you

1418
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:25,708
know what I mean? Uh, and the
people have floated off. I mean,

1419
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:28,078
we get, I mean, like whatever
our members are excited, we're

1420
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:30,448
excited all the time. You know,
we, we floated ideas, people,

1421
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,939
other people float ideas, but,
um, you know, like we always

1422
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:35,399
want

1423
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,673
to take into, and we do take
into account, you know, the

1424
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:37,947
health of

1425
01:10:37,948 --> 01:10:39,448
the community, how we can
support them, um, things like

1426
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:40,948
that. And,

1427
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:45,269
um, Yeah, it's, it's been, I
don't know. It's been, it's been

1428
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:47,354
wild. It's been, uh, it's, uh,
it's been cool and I'm still,

1429
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,439
I'm

1430
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:51,988
still very, very excited about
it and where we're heading, you

1431
01:10:51,988 --> 01:10:52,168
know,

1432
01:10:53,884 --> 01:10:57,409
Bekah: Yeah, for sure. It is
very nice to see people

1433
01:10:57,409 --> 01:11:00,934
comfortable in

1434
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:06,814
our community and being willing
to grow and to support each

1435
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:09,484
other. And that's the biggest
thing for me. So if you're going

1436
01:11:09,484 --> 01:11:14,404
to ask me, what metric do you
use to tell whether or not your

1437
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:18,064
community is healthy? It is the
supportiveness of the community

1438
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:21,003
for every member that's here.

1439
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:24,954
Dan: Well, did you have anything
else you wanted to cover? We've

1440
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:28,015
kind of gone for the traditional
amount of time,

1441
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,989
Bekah: here's your last question
of the day: Virtual Coffee in

1442
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:33,279
five years? What does it look
like?

1443
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:35,900
Dan: Hmm. Yeah. I don't know.
Five years. All right. So in

1444
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,215
five

1445
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:44,368
years, um, that will be 2026. I
mean, what I have to do for any

1446
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,033
of these kinds of things is
place myself, right? So like?

1447
01:11:46,033 --> 01:11:47,698
I'll be

1448
01:11:47,759 --> 01:11:50,813
even more old. Uh, Ben will be
10 and Samson will be seven,

1449
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:53,867
that's

1450
01:11:53,868 --> 01:11:54,498
going to be,

1451
01:11:57,274 --> 01:11:57,814
Bekah: different,

1452
01:11:57,899 --> 01:11:58,338
Dan: be something.

1453
01:11:58,413 --> 01:11:58,594
Bekah: or

1454
01:12:00,139 --> 01:12:01,849
Dan: And, um, yeah, I don't
know. Hopefully, I mean,

1455
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:03,559
hopefully it

1456
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:09,048
looks kind of the same, you know
what I mean? But I mean, feels

1457
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:12,373
the same is I guess, more more
what I think, you know, um, I

1458
01:12:12,373 --> 01:12:16,923
imagine Virtual Coffee, having
a, sorry, a larger presence as a

1459
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:21,724
platform, you know, um, you
know, we've, we've talked about

1460
01:12:21,724 --> 01:12:23,539
different satellites. We talked
about a million different

1461
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,354
options

1462
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:27,528
for everything, you know? Um,
but the essence of it is still,

1463
01:12:27,528 --> 01:12:29,702
I

1464
01:12:29,703 --> 01:12:34,194
feel, I feel like it's important
for us to, um, hold onto, you

1465
01:12:34,203 --> 01:12:35,673
know, the intimacy and
everything like that. And so I

1466
01:12:35,673 --> 01:12:37,143
just hope

1467
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,304
Virtual Coffee, it looks like a
place that you can go and have

1468
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:43,713
real conversations with real
people. And, uh, um, that's,

1469
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,384
that's it? Yeah. You know, I, I
can't, I can't even picture it

1470
01:12:46,384 --> 01:12:50,224
five years from now. Um, like on
a, on a low, on a practical

1471
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:53,344
level, you know, I have, no, I
have no idea. I mean, who knows

1472
01:12:53,344 --> 01:12:58,024
even what kind of frameworks or
whatever will be out there, you

1473
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:02,014
know, maybe it'll all just be AI
stuff and it'll all just be, uh,

1474
01:13:02,493 --> 01:13:07,033
us learning how to, um, you
know, feed datasets to things or

1475
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:07,753
something. I don't know.

1476
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:14,418
Bekah: and like, I set you up to
fail. I think the idea of, you

1477
01:13:14,418 --> 01:13:17,268
know, the real relationships is
the best answer. So you got

1478
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,118
that.

1479
01:13:21,304 --> 01:13:29,644
Dan: Um, okay. So speaking of
Hacktoberfest and, um, awesome

1480
01:13:30,394 --> 01:13:33,194
members, I literally just got
this Twitter notification that

1481
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:36,213
just popped up on my phone, um,
from Lucia who's one of our like

1482
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:38,433
long-time, uh, OG members and
she just like, this just

1483
01:13:38,433 --> 01:13:40,653
happened.

1484
01:13:40,743 --> 01:13:42,038
She said, "woke up this morning,
looking forward to

1485
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:43,333
Hacktoberfest.

1486
01:13:43,934 --> 01:13:47,264
Yes, it's May. Thanks to Virtual
Coffee IO." And, uh, I don't

1487
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:50,923
know. That was, that was
awesome. Um,

1488
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:51,298
Bekah: notes.

1489
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:53,628
Dan: I, um, yes. And that this
is what I'm talking about

1490
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:55,543
though, is

1491
01:13:55,543 --> 01:13:58,133
like, you know, she is, she's a
person who like came, I feel

1492
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,723
like

1493
01:14:00,724 --> 01:14:02,284
she was in bootcamp, um, and,
and starting the job search and,

1494
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:03,844
uh,

1495
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:08,493
Hacktoberfest is like this great
experience that we all did

1496
01:14:08,493 --> 01:14:13,069
together. And, um, Lucia is just
like woke up this morning,

1497
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:18,754
thinking about how Hacktoberfest
It's awesome. Well, well, cool.

1498
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:24,439
I

1499
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:25,908
think that was, I don't know
that I think that was really fun

1500
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:27,377
and

1501
01:14:27,378 --> 01:14:31,219
