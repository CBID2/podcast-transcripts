00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season one, episode two of

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,110
the virtual coffee podcast.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,250
I'm Bekah.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,010
And this is a podcast that
features members of the

5
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:24,270
virtual coffee community.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,690
Virtual coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,040
stages of their coding journey.

8
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:32,165
They're here on this podcast,
sharing their stories

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:32,975
and what they've learned.

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,185
And we are here to share it with
you here with me.

11
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,045
Today is my co-host Dan.

12
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:39,185
Dan: Hey everyone.

13
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,155
Um, we have another great
episode today.

14
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:45,785
Um, Kirk will be joining us to
interview Marie Antones

15
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,935
about how she went from being a
chef to a junior developer.

16
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,035
Marie is from Cedar rapids,
Iowa.

17
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:53,765
And she changed careers from the
culinary industry

18
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:57,365
to software development in 2020,
after living in

19
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,475
Bermuda for four years.

20
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,445
Um, she's currently a c.net
developer, uh, working

21
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,375
for a small startup.

22
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,245
Um, Marie shared with us, her
story, how she's used

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,195
her past experience as a chef to
help understand

24
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:09,335
coding in her own way.

25
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,575
She also talked about the
challenges of coming into her

26
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:15,935
first job from a bootcamp and
what she wishes she would've

27
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,075
known before starting that.

28
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:22,005
Marie is one of my favorite
people, uh, in virtual coffee.

29
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,994
And I was just very glad that
she agreed to come and talk with

30
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,235
us and, uh, share her story.

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,120
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,710
Like we start every virtual
coffee.

33
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,100
We introduce ourselves with our
name, where we're

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,340
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,420
Today's question is what are you
most looking forward to today?

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,400
We hope you enjoyed this
episode.

37
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,525
Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end
developer from a small

38
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,915
town in Southeastern Ohio.

39
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:04,665
And what I am most looking
forward to today because we are

40
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:08,445
recording on a Friday is the new
episode of the Mandalorian.

41
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,905
Dan: Hi, I am Dan.

42
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:14,295
I am front end developer from
Cleveland, Ohio, and

43
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:17,025
the thing I'm most looking
forward to is the lunch I'm

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,955
going to have after this.

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,290
Kirk: Hi, I'm Kirk, I'm a.net
developer and the Caribbean.

46
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,000
The thing I'm most looking
forward to today is working on

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,829
a secret project after work.

48
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,829
Marie: Hi, I'm Marie Antones.

49
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,690
I am from Cedar rapids, Iowa.

50
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:42,540
I am a junior developer for a
small startup called

51
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,079
strata folio and the thing I'm
most looking forward to.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,590
Today is going for a walk on the
beach.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,990
Bekah: That sounds amazing.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,590
We are super happy to have you
here with us today, Marie.

55
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,900
Thanks so much for agreeing to
be on the podcast.

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,950
Thanks for having me.

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah.

58
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,520
All right, Marie, I think what
we wanna start off with

59
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,490
is finding out a little bit
about your origin story.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,100
So you come from a
non-traditional

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,270
path to programming.

62
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,790
Can you tell us a little bit
about how you got.

63
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,975
Marie: Yeah, well, I have had
many different paths in

64
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,415
my educational background.

65
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:19,964
I first started off with
nutrition.

66
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:23,084
I wanted to be a nutritionist,
but then I

67
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,285
moved around quite a bit.

68
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:28,575
And then I got into kinesiology
and then eventually I got

69
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,704
into the culinary industry,
which I stuck with.

70
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:36,554
Um, and then my husband and I
actually moved to Bermuda.

71
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:40,035
He, he got a different promotion
for his job.

72
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,265
He works for Transamerica.

73
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:46,305
And he was like, oh, Hey, this
position opened up in Bermuda.

74
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:47,445
We should go.

75
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:50,535
And I was like, sure, no way
we're ever gonna get

76
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,245
that, but might as well.

77
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:55,785
And then lo and behold, we were
here.

78
00:03:56,145 --> 00:04:01,755
I thought there was gonna be
like forest, lots of

79
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:05,985
animals, lots of like fruit and
tropical stuff, but that

80
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,695
was not the case, which.

81
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,205
Leads me to kind of where I am
now.

82
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:14,895
Bermuda's quite hard for some
expats, depending on

83
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:18,735
your industry to have a job
without work, permits,

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,295
visas, all of that.

85
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:25,695
And so I really took a four year
vacation basically, where

86
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,035
I didn't really have a job.

87
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:32,625
I, I then spent my time
volunteering for a

88
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,215
international women's club.

89
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,705
, which does a lot of like
marketing and fundraising for

90
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:42,135
local charities on the island.

91
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,435
So I really spent all my time
doing that, which

92
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,474
that was, that was fun.

93
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:50,985
But then when he got a new
position back in

94
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:52,635
Iowa, I was like, perfect.

95
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:55,125
I can get a job thinking I was
gonna go back to

96
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,355
the culinary industry.

97
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:01,035
And then my main idea was to
build a pasta website so I

98
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,245
could sell homemade pastas at
the local farmer's markets.

99
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:08,565
So like no one sells fresh
pasta, homemade,

100
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,125
fresh pasta anywhere.

101
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,655
So I was like, this would be
perfect.

102
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,095
No one does it.

103
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,865
Like it would be great.

104
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:20,925
So then I was researching how to
build a website or to

105
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,415
find someone like you guys to
build a website for me.

106
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:23,715
And I was.

107
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,380
Wow.

108
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,600
That's a lot of money that I
don't have.

109
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,820
So I was like, I'm just gonna do
it myself,

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
basically with everything.

111
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,010
If I can do it myself, I'm gonna
do it myself.

112
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,950
Anything from like going to get
a manicure.

113
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,310
I just watch the lady take
notes, go home, buy

114
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,930
the stuff, do it myself.

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,060
save myself some money.

116
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,530
But that really led me to
finding Delta V code

117
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,020
school, which is the bootcamp I
attended.

118
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,400
And.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
It was actually right across the
street from where I lived.

120
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,340
So I was like, this is so
perfect.

121
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,630
And so my husband told me that,
yeah, you could try the

122
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,590
first, first class because I'm
not a technical person.

123
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,090
My background's not technical.

124
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,860
I only use a computer when I was
on social media or looking

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,080
at the recipe, but that's about
the extent of my te knowledge.

126
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,130
So I took it.

127
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,994
The first class was just on
basic HTML, CSS.

128
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:30,914
They had you build like a 1, 1,
1 page website.

129
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,164
It was one, a one day course.

130
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,335
I fell in love with it.

131
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,474
I was like, wow, this is great.

132
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,614
I can make anything I want.

133
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:38,835
like anything.

134
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,875
And then I took one or two to
really like, make sure.

135
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,550
I wanted to do this career path,
which it was the same story.

136
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,540
Still loved it.

137
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,170
Still.

138
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,990
We had to do some pre-work on
Khan academy.

139
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,540
I don't know if you guys have
done any Khan

140
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,890
academy, but I built this.

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,860
I spent all week building this
little pixelated,

142
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,690
Mario with animations.

143
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:04,380
That's awesome.

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,990
And that's, that's all I could
spend my time on.

145
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,270
So I was like, if I, if I could
get lost spending

146
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,360
my time on something, it's
definitely worth my time.

147
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:17,775
So that's kind of how I got into
software development.

148
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:23,055
Bekah: I have to say, I love so
much, um, hearing your

149
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:26,505
story, but also the idea of not
having a technical

150
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,835
background at all, because I
would say like, my background

151
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,785
was not technical at all.

152
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,965
I taught college English for 10
years and I also was not.

153
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:39,224
building my space pages when I'm
working or whatever, you

154
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:44,505
know,  um, but I think that it's
really good to hear that

155
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,224
because I think sometimes people
get really nervous about

156
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:49,875
thinking that they can do it.

157
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,315
Like, well, I don't have
background.

158
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,715
Like, I don't know what HTML
means.

159
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,255
And I think that you don't have
to know that.

160
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,805
I mean, it's, it's about like,
exactly what you're saying.

161
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,635
It's about the learning process.

162
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:07,110
Marie: Mm-hmm . One thing that a
lot of times in bootcamp they

163
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,130
talked about is your previous
experience really helps you in

164
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,130
software development, because
think of a recipe as kind

165
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,500
of like building a website,
like, oh, I know I need this

166
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,260
piece, but what if I don't know
how to do this piece?

167
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,440
I'll go look it up, go watch a
YouTube video.

168
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,919
Do all the stuff to like, do a
little research

169
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,830
or fiddle with it, play around
with it experiment.

170
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,020
And then eventually you get to a
place where

171
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,159
you're like comfortable.

172
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,260
Oh, I can make cookies now
without looking at the

173
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,220
recipe, I can make this, I can,
I can create a modal.

174
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,549
I can do this CSS grid without
really having to go to the

175
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,380
documentation every single time.

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
Cuz it kind of just practice
and.

177
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:50,535
Enjoying the, the process.

178
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,255
Yeah, it's awesome.

179
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,165
Dan: I could see a lot of like a
lot of the thought processes

180
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,035
like that are the same.

181
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,795
And there's also like with
cooking there's language

182
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,445
stuff that you need to learn,
there's, you know,

183
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,795
terminology and everything.

184
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,505
Um, there's, there's a lot of
like a lot

185
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:03,645
of parallels for sure.

186
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,825
I, in the kitchen, when I'm
cooking, I'm totally lost all

187
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,105
the time and I'm looking up
every single word and, you

188
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:10,155
know, doing that same thing.

189
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:13,155
So it's, I can see a lot of, a
lot of parallels there.

190
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:13,275
That's.

191
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,045
Kirk: So king makes me angry
because I want the food to be

192
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,145
ready immediately and it is not.

193
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:22,425
And I suppose that is the way my
clients feel when they're

194
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,005
like, why isn't the code done?

195
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:29,265
Uh, well it takes time to get it
right, but I'm hungry now.

196
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:34,380
I will also say when you said
like, Knowing what HTL means.

197
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,819
I did have to do a quick self
check.

198
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:37,260
Like, do I know what HTML means?

199
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,740
I text.

200
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,160
Okay.

201
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,579
I'm cool.

202
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,630
but definitely echoing what
everyone else is saying.

203
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:47,040
Like at the beginning, there's
so much, you don't know.

204
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,230
And I feel like software is one
of those spaces.

205
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,250
Where's almost like immediately
obvious how much you don't

206
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,920
know, because you're seeing
everyone's conversations and

207
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,670
you can't follow any of them.

208
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:01,035
And like, I suppose the solution
is just like, kinda

209
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,195
like put your head down and like
focus on what's in front

210
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:06,015
of you, but it's definitely
daunting at the beginning.

211
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:10,905
Um, and kind of in the middle,
cuz like, I don't know,

212
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,045
like it just never stops.

213
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,205
Like you'll go online and used
to people talk about something,

214
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,955
you know, nothing about.

215
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,515
And you're like, I really don't
know anything.

216
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:19,035
Marie: Yeah.

217
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,075
Or that's like even being in the
industry for a

218
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,835
long time, you could hear
something completely new.

219
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:28,935
I think Kirk, when we were
pairing the other day for

220
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,385
the code challenge, you're like,
oh, dot net has

221
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,005
so many new cool things.

222
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,714
I was like, yeah, I'm guessing
most people in.net

223
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,905
when something new comes out,
they're just like, wow.

224
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:44,775
Or something they haven't worked
with before or a section

225
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:45,314
they haven't worked with.

226
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:47,055
It's really hard to know
everything.

227
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:48,915
So, yeah.

228
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,895
Which is kind of what makes it
fun.

229
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:52,395
There's a million new recipes.

230
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:52,905
There's a million.

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,700
Code things, new new
technologies.

232
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,690
Yeah.

233
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,700
Bekah: I think you need to start
a site.

234
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,020
That's called code recipes.

235
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,450
If there's not one, it would be
like, so

236
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,140
Marie: perfect.

237
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,760
That one would be perfect.

238
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,330
Dan: Yeah.

239
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Sorry.

240
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,890
I was just gonna say no, go
ahead.

241
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,550
I was just gonna say recipes has
become like a language in

242
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,280
code documentation that has I
found actually to be really,

243
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,060
um, really helpful, like cuz cuz
people know what it means.

244
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,050
Like what a recipe means.

245
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,050
Like this is like a, a set of
steps and ingredients

246
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,810
that you need to.

247
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:27,075
Do this one thing, you know, and
it's, it's just like

248
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,305
that sort of thought process.

249
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,515
I've, I've found to be very
level as a, as a consumer of

250
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,035
documentation or whatever, you
know, it's like a, trying to

251
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,435
learn how to do a thing, you
know, like here's a recipe

252
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:38,085
for whatever, whatever.

253
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:38,475
Marie: Yeah.

254
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:43,605
Like, like wiring up a mole,
like first you do this and then.

255
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,510
What would be great.

256
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,910
And like a recipe book would be
like, oh, here are the

257
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,110
problems you could encounter.

258
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,330
Mm-hmm  and here's how you solve
them.

259
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,199
Have you checked this?

260
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,870
Bekah: That's so awesome.

261
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,280
I love that, Marie.

262
00:11:56,285 --> 00:12:00,840
I know you have gone through
such a journey since I've

263
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,250
met you at virtual coffee.

264
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:05,565
You know, I think that you are
still in school and

265
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:07,245
then you got your first job.

266
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,305
Um, but one of the things I've
always been super impressed

267
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,885
with is I know that you say that
you're a junior developer,

268
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,345
but you've never felt like a
junior developer when

269
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:19,125
I'm talking to you, you are just
very knowledgeable and,

270
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:23,955
um, great at communicating what
you're talking about.

271
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,850
um, but so it's been great to
see that whole journey

272
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,380
through virtual coffee.

273
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,680
And just out of curiosity, how
did you find out

274
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,910
about virtual coffee?

275
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,870
Marie: I found virtual coffee
because.

276
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,335
In bootcamp, they were like, oh,
networking,

277
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,345
networking, networking, which
I'm pretty sure.

278
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,625
I was the only one who did
Twitter at that time.

279
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:48,555
Cuz I only got a Twitter to
follow tech people and your name

280
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:52,635
actually popped up as someone to
follow Bekah and I saw, oh,

281
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:55,245
she's from Ohio, I'm from Ohio.

282
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,745
We're gonna be like the same
person.

283
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:59,595
So I followed you and then you
kept tweeting about, and

284
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:00,975
I'm like, Hmm, virtual coffee.

285
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:01,875
That seems is weird.

286
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,665
And I'm like, I might as well
just go.

287
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,560
It's just like how I found the
women's club.

288
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
If I hear about it enough, I'll
be like,

289
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,590
might as well try it out.

290
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,670
And so there I was, I'm like,
oh, I'm nervous, new people.

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm also not a great public
speaker.

292
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,360
So I was just nervous in
general, but.

293
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,985
It's nice seeing people's faces.

294
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:25,425
Everyone had their cameras on.

295
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,345
You're like, oh, these are real
people.

296
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,725
I'm not talking to a wall.

297
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:29,895
They have emotions.

298
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:31,964
And that just makes it more
comfortable.

299
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:36,165
And then also the icebreakers
that we do, the random questions

300
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:39,944
that also helps because it kind
of like lets you know

301
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:42,675
more about the person other than
just their tech side.

302
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,985
And there's not these barriers
of, oh, you

303
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,185
have to speak about tech.

304
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,415
When you come to virtual coffee.

305
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,000
We talk about so many things
that it just

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,050
makes it more personal.

307
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,260
And I get to know everyone who
comes and you get to

308
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,550
know like their story.

309
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,060
And it really feels like, oh,
we're actually friends.

310
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,120
This is like, I'm going to
coffee to meet a friend because

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,350
how many times do you go to a
meetup and everyone's silent.

312
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,600
No one knows what to talk about.

313
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,880
You don't really know how to
introduce yourself, even

314
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,840
if I've been to say a meetup
that I'm consistently at.

315
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:20,295
There's some weird barrier
communication barrier or

316
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:23,594
something where you're like, I
don't really know this person.

317
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,055
And in virtual coffee, that's
completely different.

318
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,125
Everyone knows everyone's story.

319
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,865
Everyone knows your background.

320
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,385
Everyone knows what you like,
what your strengths are.

321
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,194
Like every time I see F sharp,
I'm like, where is Kirk at?

322
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,185
Kirk: I like a

323
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:37,714
Marie: brain.

324
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:38,474
We all know.

325
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:39,344
Yeah.

326
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,474
We all know like about each
other.

327
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,755
What's which makes it like
really great

328
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:44,925
to just come back to.

329
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,570
And I think you really get a
sense of community with that.

330
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,470
I'm

331
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,880
Bekah: just gonna start crying
over here though.

332
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,160
so wonderful.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,390
Marie: Thank you.

334
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,650
Yeah, but it is great because no
other meetup and I go

335
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,380
to a lot of meetups because
Delta V really like was like,

336
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,220
networking is probably the most
likely to get you a job.

337
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,520
So I'm like, well, looks like
I'm going to everything now.

338
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,630
So.

339
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,140
Out of all my meetups, nothing
has ever felt

340
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,690
like a solid community.

341
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,910
So it's just great.

342
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:22,980
Kirk: Yeah.

343
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,910
I really, as somebody who used
to go to a lot of meetups, I

344
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,510
definitely remember being that
guy by like the cheese plate.

345
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,550
The only I can think of saying
is like, oh,

346
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,540
a lot of cheese today.

347
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,020
So, you know, like, I don't know
what we're supposed to

348
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,510
do here until like the main
presenter starts stalking.

349
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,680
So I'll just try and look.

350
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,540
Mm-hmm,  intrigued at
everything.

351
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,660
Um, I do definitely also
appreciate that.

352
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:49,005
The conversation, isn't that
hard to start here.

353
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:51,975
Like, you know what to do, like
there's a nice lead in versus

354
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:54,435
just middle about make friends.

355
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:58,545
It seems like between the ages
of four and like 74,

356
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,165
we still have the same advice
for certain people.

357
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,425
Like you just sort of push them
in a room and

358
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:05,775
say, go, go be yourself, which
is not as helpful.

359
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:06,345
Terrifying.

360
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,520
Bekah: I am very much an
introvert.

361
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,650
So like going to a conference or
I've, I've never

362
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,670
actually been to a meetup.

363
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,230
Um, that's not online, but I, I
will just stand by the

364
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,455
wall and then like, Try and make
eye contact with somebody

365
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,475
and hope they're friendly.

366
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:29,295
Marie: I am the same way.

367
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,155
And then when they come up to
you and talk, you're just like,

368
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:35,925
Dan: I actually have been
running the, the

369
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:36,735
Cleveland react meetup.

370
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,925
We started like a, I don't know,
a year and a half

371
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,715
ago or something back when we
could see people.

372
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:44,985
Uh, but I was also the same way,
like in general,

373
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,324
you know, wanting to like, I
don't know, just kind

374
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:48,194
of hang back or whatever.

375
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:48,615
And.

376
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,630
It was a really hard problem to
solve for, you

377
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,560
know, as an organizer.

378
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,470
And I saw it happening and, you
know, didn't know

379
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,340
how to fix it, really.

380
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,630
Um, having this sort of
structure that we have is, I

381
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,030
don't know, has been really
awesome at virtual coffee.

382
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,740
Nice way to solve all

383
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:04,860
Bekah: that.

384
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah.

385
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,720
I, I was talking to a conference
organizer recently

386
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,370
about, you know, the, that idea,
that same idea, like

387
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,569
how do you bring people in?

388
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,180
How do you make people feel
welcome?

389
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,480
And one of the things that he
was talking about was when,

390
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,160
you know, the people who are
there, um, that's how you're

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,880
able to make the connections and
with virtual coffee

392
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,900
and having these, you know,
frequent coffees, we, we do

393
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,280
get to know each other and, um,
it makes it easier for all

394
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,850
of us to kind of talk to each
other about different things.

395
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,360
Um, and also I think it provides
a really great environment.

396
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,695
People at all levels, um, which
can be, I think really

397
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:53,145
challenging, but to, you know,
feel welcome as a

398
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:56,445
new developer and to feel like
you have a place here.

399
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:00,135
If you've been doing this for
your whole career is just

400
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,605
something that is, I don't know.

401
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,345
I really value it about this
community.

402
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:11,115
Um, Marie I, one of the
questions that I, I love

403
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:17,880
to hear people answer is, um,
Finding that transition

404
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,680
period from going to bootcamp
into your first job and

405
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,230
how, how does that play out?

406
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,120
So I know for everybody it's
different, but it

407
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,770
can be really challenging.

408
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,400
So can you talk a little bit
about that experience and

409
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,560
maybe some of the challenges you
didn't anticipate?

410
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,380
Marie: So I think the biggest
challenge with transitioning

411
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,320
from bootcamp to my job.

412
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:49,095
I assumed a lot of things would
be similar to how we

413
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,935
structured, like the code base
or laid things out

414
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:56,715
because we did C sharp the last
six weeks of bootcamp.

415
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:01,695
And the project I'm on now works
as C sharp, but things

416
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:05,415
are completely different how
they're laid out, which going

417
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:08,235
into a really huge code base.

418
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,205
I didn't really learn how to
navigate through.

419
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,225
Something with hundreds of
files.

420
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:20,205
So I'm also lucky that my
instructor, Keith,

421
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:23,325
which you guys have met, he also
consults for us.

422
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:28,665
So he is in with me most days,
teaching me how to navigate,

423
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:34,035
how to just like go from one
part of the project to the next

424
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:38,055
or little tips like, oh, this is
like, look, look for this.

425
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,495
Or you can tell why this.

426
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:45,389
Which is nice because I'm not
sure how other teams are, cuz

427
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,850
I only have this experience with
a very small team, but I'm

428
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,340
guessing on a bigger team you'll
you would have someone pairing

429
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:58,050
with you showing you kind of the
ropes of, oh, here's the project

430
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,120
you might run into this or like
here's how we, I personally

431
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,649
get from file to file.

432
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,524
Um, But I think that was the
hardest transition was, wow,

433
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:11,564
this there's a lot of files.

434
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,115
This isn't just like 10 files.

435
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,794
And then just all of the, the
new things of adapting to

436
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:23,594
people you don't know, like, of
course, like I've been

437
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:27,794
there since July, whenever you,
you start something new

438
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,834
or go to a new school or go.

439
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,524
Anywhere new you're very like
closed off.

440
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:36,645
You don't really wanna tell them
like, oh, I'm

441
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:38,205
not really sure about this.

442
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:43,235
You just wing it until you're
like, okay, I

443
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,235
actually need help now.

444
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:51,044
so it's just like, uh, and then
Keith is always like,

445
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,544
no, just ask right away.

446
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:54,044
It's just better.

447
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah, probably just adapt
adapting to new the new

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,639
code base and new structure.

449
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,450
That's not the same as.

450
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:07,965
The day to day bootcamp life.

451
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:09,885
Bekah: Yeah, for sure.

452
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,345
I'll echo that as a bootcamp,
grad myself.

453
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:13,935
I mean exactly what you're
saying.

454
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:17,655
Like you go from working with 10
files and then you're like, what

455
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:23,264
is this even, um, how do these
things connect and why and what?

456
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,865
Um, and then it is that, that.

457
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:28,814
Time period.

458
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:31,304
You have to figure out how to
communicate.

459
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:33,824
And this is why I har on
communication being like

460
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,195
one of the most important skills
all of the time.

461
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,745
Um, especially as a new
developer, because it's

462
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:41,925
hard, like one, you don't know
when to ask, right?

463
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,054
Because certainly you need to
dig in and you need

464
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,034
to learn things yourself.

465
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:49,185
Um, and there's not really a
hard and fast role.

466
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,764
I know some people say, well,
like look at it for 15 minutes

467
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:53,175
and if you don't know, then.

468
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,300
Ask, but when you have a huge
code base, I think

469
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,129
that maybe is not, at least for
me, it's not a, a good

470
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,930
tool for judging one to ask.

471
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,129
If you're going from piece to
piece, just trying to

472
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,379
track down where all of this
stuff is coming from,

473
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:13,350
it's gonna take you longer than
15 minutes and that's

474
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,750
still valuable time spent.

475
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,040
Um, but it is that like, okay, I
need to learn these new things

476
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,409
and I need to learn how to
communicate with these people.

477
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,830
And, and basically, you know,
how to trust the people

478
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,730
that you're working with.

479
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,090
That's super important to, I
think, growing as a develop.

480
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:32,445
Marie: Yeah.

481
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,895
And trying to, um, kind of make
the connection between,

482
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:40,544
oh, let me just look at this
file and piece things together

483
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:43,125
and see if I can figure that
much out by myself so I can

484
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,465
explain kind of where I'm going.

485
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:49,845
Um, I keep mentioning Keith, but
he's very big on, you

486
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:50,985
should probably draw it out.

487
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:54,075
Can you just draw it out or
explain.

488
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:57,195
Just earlier today, he was like,
explain to me what

489
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,304
you were trying to do.

490
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:01,544
Mm-hmm  because usually that
gives you a hint to where

491
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:03,165
you're going in the first place.

492
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:03,254
Yeah.

493
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:07,274
And if you're writing it wrong,
then you're like, oh, could

494
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:08,504
you read that code out to me?

495
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:09,465
What is that doing?

496
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:11,804
Oh, that's not even what I said
in the first place.

497
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:16,065
So just trying to figuring out
how to communicate that

498
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:18,465
way as well, I think is very.

499
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:23,715
Kirk: That, um, that I, I'm
starting to think

500
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:25,455
about that concept.

501
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,065
I feel like a lot of people,
almost everyone from boot

502
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,625
camps could probably echo the,
I, I had very small

503
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:37,755
projects in boot camp and then
IL, they are not so small.

504
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:43,065
Mm-hmm  and it sort of makes me
wonder if that's there's

505
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,675
is there a way to like, work
that into curriculums?

506
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,235
Like maybe like part of the
process, like.

507
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:52,395
This section, we're working on a
large established code base

508
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:56,205
where obviously as the bootcamp
student, like you're not

509
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,655
building it from scratch, but
it's like this already exists.

510
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:02,534
And some part of the learning is
like, okay, how do you

511
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:05,655
integrate into like an already
existing system that feels

512
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:09,014
like something that can be
really valuable for people?

513
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:09,764
Or maybe

514
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:15,284
Marie: even like, yeah, I think
even just, um,

515
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:16,635
maybe boot camps could.

516
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,910
I guess talking from my bootcamp
experience, maybe,

517
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,320
um, have you tried to work on an
open source project?

518
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,300
Because even just trying to work
through that, because usually

519
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:33,060
those projects are big anyways.

520
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,410
Um, like the forum project,
there's so many files in that,

521
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,260
that, so you could even pair up
with another boot grant boot.

522
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:51,645
Person in your class and just
try to pair on it, figure it out

523
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:53,505
and walk through it that way.

524
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:54,075
Dan: Yeah.

525
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:54,675
That's interesting.

526
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,035
There's a lot of different, like
ways to that, that sort of

527
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,485
how to make a small change in a
large code base, I feel like

528
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,025
is an important skill and seems
like a solvable one from like a

529
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,665
bootcamp's perspective, whether
it's open source thing or just

530
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:10,845
like, I dunno, just like they
just have a large app that they

531
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:13,875
use, you know, like the open
source stuff is, is important

532
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,550
and, but it has its own whole
set of, you know, Whatever.

533
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,560
And then also, if it's not your
open source project,

534
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,030
then you, you know, have to hope
that there's just issues

535
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,790
that are appropriate to work on,
you know, but yeah,

536
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,870
just having some huge app.

537
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,020
Yeah.

538
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,470
That, and you're like, okay,
your next assignment is fix

539
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,850
this bug, you know, whatever.

540
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:35,820
But in this huge app, you know,
that, that's

541
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,030
interesting to think.

542
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,260
Marie: I don't know if, uh,
bootcamps can

543
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,790
pair with like local.

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,370
I don't know if flat iron has
sponsors, but

545
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,900
Delta V has sponsors may.

546
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,670
Maybe they could for a week out
of the, out of the, uh,

547
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,920
curriculum pair with those
sponsors and have students work

548
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:59,820
on a small feature, like, oh,
get to know our, our product.

549
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,800
I know a lot of companies are
private.

550
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:06,330
but even just like looking,
looking at sign some consent

551
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,139
form or something, but looking
at a large company's

552
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,480
code base and being like, oh,
maybe partner or pair

553
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,720
with one of the employees,
because that even will give

554
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,870
them an insight to how like day
to day jobs are as well.

555
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,610
Bekah: Yeah.

556
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,235
I think, um,  there's a program
called collab lab.

557
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:30,615
Um, and they are doing something
similar because they're working

558
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:35,280
with a lot of people who, um,
Are from nontraditional

559
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,909
backgrounds, but they're finding
that the issue when they go

560
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:41,250
to interview is, well, you don't
have enough experience

561
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,969
or you, the way that you talk
about code, isn't clear.

562
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,250
I mean, a lot of us aren't used
to talking about it.

563
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,290
If we're coming from
nontraditional backgrounds, if

564
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,320
you're teaching yourself, who
are you talking to about code?

565
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,379
If you're in a bootcamp or
you're working self-paced,

566
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:58,860
um, remotely, then it's the,
it's the same issue.

567
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,740
So they pair up teams to work on
a project.

568
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,210
And I, I don't wanna say exactly
what it is cuz I can't remember,

569
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,040
but it's a larger project.

570
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,050
It helps 'em to develop skills,
um, team building communication.

571
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,240
They're using GitHub for the
project.

572
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,550
So really developing a lot of
the skills that I think

573
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,280
that boot camps miss out on.

574
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,830
So that's, you know, certainly
helpful.

575
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:28,245
And I think like for me, one of
my favorite things that we've

576
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:31,004
done at virtual coffee is the
hack Tober Fest initiative.

577
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:36,014
Mm-hmm  um, and that was just a
really great way to learn about.

578
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:40,560
um, working on different
people's projects, how different

579
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,180
people communicate, um, how to
work with contributors and then

580
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,950
just have a wide variety of
both, um, open source projects,

581
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,660
but support of the community.

582
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,680
So, you know, having that there
as well was, was really

583
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,260
fruitful, um, for me anyway.

584
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,780
And I think that, you know,
you're definitely on the right

585
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,440
track of terms of like, kind of
thinking through some of

586
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,105
the issues, um,  and I love too
how you were describing

587
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:12,875
like different how learning a
process almost for what you're

588
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:18,605
doing and how you're doing it,
um, is, is super valuable too.

589
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:19,685
Marie: Yeah.

590
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:22,625
One thing I liked about Heto
Fest is I worked with

591
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:26,274
a lot of people's projects who
weren't my language

592
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:27,905
that I was comfortable with.

593
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,125
So I'm most comfortable with C.

594
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,740
I worked with Kirk quite a bit
on his Elm project.

595
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,570
And we could talk about like
similarities between what I know

596
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,490
and what he knows through Elm.

597
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,690
I'm like, oh, I like, I can, I
can basically understand this

598
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,920
or get where this is going.

599
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,870
Even though I don't know the
language.

600
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,500
And this is the first time I've
ever worked in Elm before.

601
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,550
So it's kind of nice just
knowing that, oh, I know

602
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,820
the basic core concept of like
JavaScript C sharp.

603
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,375
HTML all that.

604
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:07,125
And then I could translate it
into how to help Kirk

605
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:12,495
with his Elm project, which is
nice to know like, oh,

606
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,385
or nice to gain experience,
knowing like, oh, even though

607
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,925
I don't know this language or
know this, this project

608
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:26,415
or no, like this library, I know
I can at least figure

609
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:29,475
out some pieces to make the
connection between what I know.

610
00:29:30,074 --> 00:29:34,094
And the new project language or
anything new

611
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:35,445
that I might be working on.

612
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:40,425
Kirk: What also Marie did not
mention was that while

613
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:44,024
she was pairing with me, we
totally found a weird

614
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:45,614
thing that VSCO does.

615
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:48,945
And I had no idea what was going
on and I was panicking

616
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:51,975
and I'm like, I've ruined her
hack, Tober Fest experience.

617
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:55,094
Everything is terrible now, but
she was very, she was

618
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,584
very pleasant about it and she
told me it was fine.

619
00:29:58,155 --> 00:29:59,235
And we eventually figured it.

620
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:03,014
, um, which is one of the fun
things about, about pairing,

621
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:07,334
but yeah, I, I do, cuz I
remember when we, we spoke about

622
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:09,435
Octoberfest and how we wanted to
do it, we spent a lot of

623
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:12,135
time thinking, well, do we wanna
reach out to different groups?

624
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,875
And should we source like good
projects?

625
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:18,135
And then we realized it was so
hard to sort of do quality

626
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:22,344
control on like the wider open
source universe that.

627
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,130
We just, oh, we should probably
just like do our own thing at

628
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,920
least make sure, like, we have
one established project that

629
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,120
like, we know will provide like
a good experience for people

630
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,060
because like we made it and
we're the ones maintaining it.

631
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,300
Um, and I think that actually
turned out pretty well.

632
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:42,090
And then, you know, everybody
who participated kind of

633
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,990
like fed off each other.

634
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,100
So someone had a good read me.

635
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,640
I'm like, oh, okay.

636
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,810
I'm gonna use a read me like
that.

637
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,810
Oh, you have good, um,
templates.

638
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,740
I'll borrow your templates.

639
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:49,860
So.

640
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,264
and the projects are still the
projects they're still, you

641
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:55,395
know, like unique in different
languages and wonderful, but

642
00:30:55,395 --> 00:31:02,205
at least the approach and the
user friendliness for newer

643
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:05,685
developers was like something we
could try and standardize.

644
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,085
And I'm, I'm really happy with
how that turned out.

645
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:13,485
Um, you know, even, even for me,
like, I, I didn't have that much

646
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:16,815
experience contributing to other
people's projects before this.

647
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,635
Um, it was fun.

648
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:22,305
That was, that was really, that
was really cool.

649
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:27,255
And I, I, I also wish, like I'd
had more chances to do that way

650
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:30,015
earlier in my career than now.

651
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:32,325
I wish I had just been doing
that from the start, cuz that

652
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,185
is the majority of people.

653
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,495
When you work in software, like
you're not fielding

654
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,405
up something from scratch,
you're working on something

655
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:40,425
already established, right.

656
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,770
Marie: One of the aspects of
Octoberfest that I really

657
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:53,219
enjoyed was, um, Nick helped me
set up, um, forums, project,

658
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:57,870
which you get to learn about how
to be taught by someone

659
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,419
else, because how many times are
you on a new job?

660
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,260
And then you have to work with a
new developer or a

661
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,199
new senior developer, or just
someone new on your team.

662
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,659
And you have to like try to find
a way to.

663
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,270
Discuss your problems or like
collaborate with them and figure

664
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,379
out what they're trying to say.

665
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,360
Cuz everyone explains things
differently.

666
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,530
But I think having virtual
coffees hack Octoberfest,

667
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,980
we, most of you guys had smaller
projects.

668
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,760
And that even helps people with
an introductory

669
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,970
project because it's like, oh,
here's my project.

670
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,020
I have like five to 10 files,
maybe a few more.

671
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,960
And then you guys are like, oh
no, I'm trying to

672
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,700
build this feature in this
feature and this feature.

673
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,370
So we have quite a bit more code
and then you could go to even

674
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:53,129
bigger open source projects like
forum and then, and then work.

675
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,420
Like my work has.

676
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,250
A ton of files.

677
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,139
So it's just like more steps, I
guess.

678
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,210
Bekah: Dot net.

679
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,420
Yeah.

680
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:04,080
I wanna touch.

681
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:10,125
Something that you said, um, the
ability to be able

682
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,555
to dive into code bases with
different languages.

683
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:14,805
And one of the things that I
heard pretty

684
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:16,365
early on was, well, okay.

685
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,125
You learned Ruby in bootcamp and
you learned JavaScript, but that

686
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,254
doesn't mean that you should
limit yourself to applying for

687
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:23,325
jobs with just those languages.

688
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:25,544
And I had heard that, but I
didn't.

689
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,220
Quite understand it.

690
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,400
And I think that you did a
really good, I, uh, good job of

691
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,970
kind of talking through how that
works, because so much of it

692
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,770
is the thought process, right?

693
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,510
It's problem solving.

694
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:37,600
Yep.

695
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,750
Um, and it's just, you know, you
have, there are gonna be

696
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,660
different terms and there are
going to be different patterns

697
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:46,000
with different languages that
you have to learn.

698
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,740
But essentially, if you have
that problem solving down,

699
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,580
and if you could do a good
analysis of what you're looking

700
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,689
at, then, then that does open
doors for you to move

701
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:00,870
to projects with different
languages or to apply for a

702
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,570
much wider variety of positions.

703
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,400
Marie: One thing we did at
bootcamp at Delvy is we had

704
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,529
mock interviews on Fridays.

705
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,969
So.

706
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,270
um, one of our sponsors actually
came into interview us.

707
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,020
They, he got a huge like
question packet and one

708
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,529
of my questions was about a
Python dictionary.

709
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,610
I don't, I know a little Python,
but I don't know Python,

710
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,710
but I know C has dictionary.

711
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,759
So I explained it.

712
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,690
Oh, I'm, I'm not familiar with
Python as much as I am C sharp

713
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,860
and I know C has dictionaries,
then I want to explain how I

714
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,219
know dictionaries and I'm like,
I'm assuming it's like Python.

715
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,129
They might not be exactly the
same, but here's what I know

716
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,639
about dictionaries, which I
think that like, anytime you're

717
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,889
in an interview and you don't
exactly know, but you've heard

718
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,049
something that could tie in.

719
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:55,080
I think that that is just really
good.

720
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,899
Just to know, oh, you might not
know the answer, but if

721
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:00,419
you can make connection to
something that, you know,

722
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,410
that really will benefit you in
the long run and even make

723
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,750
you possibly stand out, cuz some
people will just say.

724
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:08,190
Sorry.

725
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,089
I don't know Python.

726
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:12,569
I can't answer the question, but
maybe elaborate a bit more and

727
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,859
be like, oh, well, I don't know.

728
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,400
However, I am familiar with C
sharp and they have have a

729
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,750
dictionary and here's how I
would use a C sharp dictionary.

730
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,520
Python might be similar, but I
know I have

731
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,540
enough information to.

732
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:28,709
Find out how a Python dictionary
works.

733
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,810
Dan: I think that's great
advice.

734
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,290
Just like the, I think the thing
that people are looking

735
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,990
for when they're hiring,
especially, um, you know,

736
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,169
earlier career developers is, is
not so much the knowledge

737
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:43,020
of everything, but just the
ability to maybe connect the

738
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,399
dots and willingness to learn.

739
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:44,640
And.

740
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:48,315
Maybe some evidence that they
have learned things , you know,

741
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:52,005
and it's like, cause you know,
if you're hiring somebody, uh,

742
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:54,884
you know, in a, I don't know,
junior or whatever, that sort

743
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,035
of role you're expecting them to
be learning, you know, I

744
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,835
mean expecting everybody to be
learning on the job, but

745
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,835
you know, I, I think that just
great advice is like connecting

746
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:06,045
mm-hmm  like going into an
interview knowing like, I know

747
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:09,345
I'm not gonna know everything in
the world cuz nobody can,

748
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:13,185
you know, but um, the, the like
practicing and connecting the.

749
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,339
There are questions to your
knowledge, you know, uh,

750
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,470
is, is like a great, I think
that's some great insight.

751
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,000
Marie: Yeah.

752
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,280
Bekah: Um, one of the things I
also wanted to ask, I know,

753
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,990
um, it, in tech, there's so much
to learn and so much to

754
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,540
be excited about, like all the
shiny things are out there

755
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,020
and like, how do you figure out
what you wanna learn next?

756
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:43,560
So I just am curious, you know,
what are things that you are

757
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,300
interested in learning about in
the future and kind of how, how.

758
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:51,375
Or why you decided on those
things

759
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:53,835
Marie: right now?

760
00:36:54,075 --> 00:37:01,605
I am one of my, uh, tasks or
requirements in my contract.

761
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:05,415
When I, when I started work with
strata, folio is creating

762
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:09,044
a dashboard using D three JS.

763
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,944
So I actually started the
interview process

764
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,524
with strata folio before I
graduated bootcamp.

765
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,255
And they told me about this.

766
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:22,815
So I did a bit of research and
in our bootcamp we spend

767
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:26,775
a week doing self-learning so
teach yourself something new.

768
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:28,785
So I got to play around with it.

769
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:33,195
So I am really trying to learn
more D three ass and create

770
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,375
more graphs and charts and just
really cool things with it.

771
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:43,905
Um, even just trying to do that
in my free time,

772
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:44,805
or at least reading about.

773
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,770
I don't really have too much
free time, but when I do

774
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,350
finally get the free time,
that's what I would like to

775
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,339
work on just to play around with
it and see, see some

776
00:37:56,345 --> 00:37:57,480
cool things I can do with it.

777
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,200
Cause you always on, I think D
three has a website called

778
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,200
observable, which you can like
look at all the different,

779
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,230
um, like implementations of, of
the library.

780
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:14,805
I think just playing around with
it and learning about

781
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:17,085
it is just gonna be fun.

782
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:17,775
That sounds awesome.

783
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,415
I was just thinking about like,
oh, maybe, maybe I

784
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:24,674
could use one of my cookbooks
and like, try to like chart

785
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:25,964
something from a cookbook.

786
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:31,845
Oh, wine regions verse like, oh,
this said it

787
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,305
could pair with this.

788
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:39,615
This like type of dish or some,
some sort of graphic

789
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:43,875
I could make just to be fun or
different, I guess.

790
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:47,265
And just to, just to keep
learning fun.

791
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:47,955
That's

792
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,225
Dan: awesome.

793
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,995
D three D three's really cool.

794
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:51,435
There's some really cool stuff.

795
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,455
I think you can do with it.

796
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,785
I've only like you just
scratched the surface of it,

797
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:59,055
but I always keep trying, I'm
like, oh wait, let's use that.

798
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:01,245
You know, everyone's like, no,
no, it's not.

799
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,395
It's not about yet, but.

800
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:06,105
Marie: I'm not, I'm not into
like physics or anything

801
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:08,455
like that, but they have that
like force mm-hmm

802
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:11,055
force, layout, or force.

803
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:14,205
And so like playing with the
bubbles and like pulling

804
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:17,565
the bubbles and yeah, it's
really interesting.

805
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,755
And I would definitely like
playing with that a bit

806
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,195
more just to tinker and.

807
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:24,240
Like have fun with it.

808
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,080
I guess I'm it's

809
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,040
Bekah: on my list too.

810
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,950
So we should like get something
going so we

811
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,360
can all do fun stuff.

812
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,049
I feel like there's gotta

813
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,840
Dan: be something, something we
can put on the website.

814
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,040
So on the VC website,

815
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,130
Marie: one of, one of my
thoughts for next year

816
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,980
is Octoberfest, which I know a
bunch of people.

817
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,370
I just know everyone's gonna
love it is creating

818
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,210
something for students, for data
structures.

819
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,529
Because D three uses can use a
lot of animations.

820
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,810
So like, as you scroll through
the page, like maybe like

821
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,980
building like link list or going
through different, um,

822
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,890
data structures and explaining
how they work and different

823
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,180
problems that go along with them
as using D three.

824
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,160
And just like, as you scroll
through the page, like, oh,

825
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,430
this is how you go through a
binary tree or reverse

826
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,370
a binary tree or anything.

827
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,069
It would just be really cool to
build something out like that.

828
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:19,529
As you scroll through the page,
you just see like the data

829
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:24,090
structures being like built or
like going through a array or

830
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,660
a multi-dimensional array or
something like that would be, I

831
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,200
think that would be really fun
to do as like a group project.

832
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:35,100
Cuz we do the exorcism or
different like advent of

833
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,290
code, just like then you would
have to like the, the.

834
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:46,245
Code recipes is kind of
explaining in more basic

835
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:50,535
terminology, how to work through
like data structures

836
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,875
or different challenges.

837
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:58,695
Dan: There is somebody's I'm
man, there's a woman who has

838
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:01,365
a blog that she does kind of
like what you're talking about.

839
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:03,765
And I cannot remember what her
name is, but I will,

840
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:04,635
I will send you the link.

841
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:05,595
I'll share the link.

842
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,700
As soon as I find it, cause she
has done, she's done

843
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,340
some they're mostly front end
tutorials, I think.

844
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,820
But, um, mm-hmm,  uses D three
and uses animation

845
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,890
as you scroll and like all this
really cool stuff.

846
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:19,530
I, I haven't, it's spoken me
that I can't remember her

847
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,660
name, but I will, I will, uh, I
will send it to you.

848
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,880
And I'll if I remember it, I'll,
I'll put in the show

849
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,960
notes as well, so yeah.

850
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,010
Marie: Yeah.

851
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,590
Cuz that, just doing that, like.

852
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,129
Is exciting because you get to
build something cool.

853
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,740
And then you're like learning in
the process like, oh, I'm

854
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,569
not like awesome at DSAs.

855
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:39,900
But if I get to like fiddle
around with something, pick

856
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,279
apart something, and then show
you this website I

857
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:48,480
built that shows you this cool
DSA  using D three.

858
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,049
It kinda like solidifies your
knowledge while keeping

859
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:56,580
totally like how kids play with
like fun, like little.

860
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,710
Little things and they still
learn from it.

861
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,129
So

862
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,089
Kirk: that's, um, there's
another project you might

863
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,379
be interested in Marie.

864
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,450
Uh, one of the folks in the Elm
community, he does touch

865
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:14,790
dreams and he was working on a
recipe site for himself in Elm.

866
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,330
Yeah.

867
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,690
And an interesting thing he was
doing was trying to make it so.

868
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,605
You could adjust, you could
scale recipes.

869
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:25,335
So like there's the way it's in
the book, like

870
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,685
a slider and like, okay.

871
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,595
But what if I actually need more
servings?

872
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:33,675
Marie: Um, yeah, like for 10
people or what if I wanna cut

873
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:36,465
it just for date night for 10,
instead of having to like

874
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,315
Kirk: buy hand, figure out, oh,
how do I trim

875
00:42:39,315 --> 00:42:40,035
all these ingredients?

876
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,445
And he was working on that, and
that was really interesting.

877
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:44,925
Because of course, nothing in
software is ever easy.

878
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:48,585
Like some things don't scale
linearly.

879
00:42:48,585 --> 00:42:50,535
So he would end up with weird
units, one third of an, a

880
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:53,505
yeah, like 0.01 grams of salt.

881
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,095
And it's like, that can't be
right.

882
00:42:55,095 --> 00:42:57,285
So it was just, it was just like
a really interesting

883
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,475
problem space that I think he's
still working on it.

884
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:03,855
But I'm wondering, I don't know
when you mentioned, I

885
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:05,505
feel like we still haven't
established by the way, whether

886
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:07,515
you made the fresh plastic site.

887
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:13,665
Marie: Do I made just like the
basic like first page,

888
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:16,935
but then from then on, I've just
been making other things.

889
00:43:17,115 --> 00:43:21,285
So it's kind of hard to get back
and careers have shifted now.

890
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,955
I'm like, oh, just focusing on
software.

891
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:27,705
So maybe in the future, people
will get fresh

892
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:28,964
pasta, people need fresh

893
00:43:29,055 --> 00:43:29,625
Kirk: pasta.

894
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,915
Um, yeah.

895
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:35,174
But yeah, I just, I remember
like I would watch him.

896
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:39,885
that was one of the ways like I
wanted to learn, not just

897
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:43,035
Elm cuz at that point, like I
was pretty familiar with the

898
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:45,345
language, but all the stuff you
were talking about, like how

899
00:43:45,345 --> 00:43:49,515
to actually set up a project,
you know, you know, what,

900
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:51,045
what is his build process?

901
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,195
Like?

902
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,485
What is his order of operations
when he is working on

903
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:57,495
something as somebody who's like
been in the industry

904
00:43:57,495 --> 00:43:58,455
for a really long time.

905
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:01,695
Um, so that was really fun to
watch and even just like how

906
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:04,425
he did his tests and like how he
iterated through solutions.

907
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:06,375
Bekah: um, okay.

908
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,375
Marie, you talked a little bit
about you're working

909
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,255
on different things you started
with this pasta site.

910
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:15,105
What other fun stuff are you
working on?

911
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:17,025
Marie: Currently?

912
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:19,935
I'm working still trying to tidy
up some of my projects

913
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:29,505
from boot camp, but, uh, we made
this C sharp website called AYQ

914
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:34,395
in and it's just asynchronous.

915
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:40,875
Like adding hotels, deleting ho
hotels editing, but I am trying

916
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,845
to tidy that up and just like
really build it out into like a

917
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:50,265
whole hotel website, which has
the backend like administrative

918
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:55,005
section with like permissions
and then the actual like hotel

919
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:59,415
site where you can go look at
these fake hotel rooms that

920
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:01,035
I'm gonna put up fake hotels.

921
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,825
So like a multi-branch hotel.

922
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,049
Um, corporation and then every
time you click, like,

923
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,420
oh, I'm going to go to, well,
I'm in Bermuda now.

924
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,580
So I'm gonna look at hotels in
Bermuda.

925
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,830
It'll show these fake hotels I
populated or put in the database

926
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:24,270
and then the rooms and, um,
prices, amenities, all of that.

927
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,450
Just building out that kind of
stuff, because I.

928
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:31,785
Right now we do stuff with like
permission checks.

929
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:35,745
So just like practicing what I
know and I'm learning on

930
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:39,555
the job, but applying it to a
different project that I'm

931
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,405
working on to kind of like
solidify my knowledge, which

932
00:45:42,465 --> 00:45:45,645
I'm gonna do it differently in
my personal project versus

933
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:49,125
work because my personal project
is set up completely

934
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,385
different than work.

935
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:59,220
And, um, Yeah, just, just using
what I'm learning, like kind of

936
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,240
fresh on the job and applying it
to my like fun side project

937
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,500
that I'm, I guess didn't start
as a fun side project, but it's

938
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,360
now a fun side project, but kind
of just solid solidifying,

939
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,520
like what I'm doing.

940
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:20,265
To Ayn, which is gonna be super
cool when it comes out.

941
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:25,215
Because I think I'm even gonna
add like, maybe not with D three

942
00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:31,965
GS, but like putting in, um, on
the administrative side, like.

943
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:37,905
Expense reports and salary and
payroll and all of that

944
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:40,455
to like have some sort of
dashboard to show, oh, you've

945
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,215
paid employees this much, but
you only made this much or

946
00:46:43,755 --> 00:46:45,645
here's where your money's going.

947
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:50,055
Or I, I haven't worked out
exactly what I wanna do with

948
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,155
it, but it's gonna turn into a
whole work in progress.

949
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:58,325
It's like huge, huge project
sounds.

950
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,165
Dan: Sounds awesome.

951
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,285
Kirk: Find someone ambitious,
but.

952
00:47:01,815 --> 00:47:03,465
Like developers look at their
side projects.

953
00:47:05,415 --> 00:47:05,865
Bekah: yeah.

954
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:11,025
I also love how you're talking
about taking what you are

955
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:13,845
learning at work and applying it
to a different project,

956
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:16,365
because that does really help to
solidify your knowledge.

957
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:21,585
Cuz sometimes I find that I can
do something in one project.

958
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,985
And then when I go to transfer
to the other project, I'm

959
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:28,005
like, wait, why, what, why isn't
this working?

960
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:28,395
Right.

961
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:30,135
And so to ha to be able to.

962
00:47:30,855 --> 00:47:35,625
Skills from one and put them
into another really does, um,

963
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:38,085
you know, help you to get a well
rounded understanding

964
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:38,895
of what you're doing.

965
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:40,634
And I think that's really great
advice.

966
00:47:42,285 --> 00:47:42,585
Marie: Yeah.

967
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:45,855
And trying to figure out, oh,
now these are the differences

968
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:52,605
between my work project and my
personal project, because we use

969
00:47:52,964 --> 00:47:55,964
old.net and my project is new.

970
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,590
The new do net core, I think.

971
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,850
Um, so there's just little tiny
little differences that

972
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,900
you're just gonna do completely
differently because there's

973
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:13,380
now new built in features and
methods, but just, yeah.

974
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:16,080
Learning to translate something
that.

975
00:48:16,635 --> 00:48:19,935
Maybe I watched this on a
YouTube video or Kirk walked

976
00:48:19,935 --> 00:48:23,295
me through this, on his project
and he set his, his project up

977
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:26,235
one way because we paired the
other day and I was like, oh

978
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:30,105
Kirk, you you're, you're setting
your project up this way.

979
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:32,535
And then see him was also there.

980
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,305
And she's like, oh, that's not
how we set it up.

981
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:36,405
But you also did yours
completely

982
00:48:36,405 --> 00:48:38,025
different, which worked.

983
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:39,165
And you.

984
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,420
There's a million different ways
to do the same thing.

985
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,320
And it's still right.

986
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,800
It still works, but it's just
figuring out, oh yeah, I

987
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,120
can think about it that way.

988
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,350
And it still works.

989
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,630
And Kirk explained, oh, I did it
because, because this

990
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,620
is how I know how to do it.

991
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,210
And I was like, oh, I did it
because this is

992
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,080
how I know how to do it.

993
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,140
Yeah.

994
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:58,440
Don't give

995
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,120
Kirk: me too much credit and
they're completely different.

996
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,400
I didn't, because that's, I only
know one away.

997
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,570
I'm like, well, this is gonna,

998
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,840
Marie: yeah, exactly, exactly
though.

999
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,370
But then you see like, You think
of it one way.

1000
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,450
I think of it this way.

1001
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,759
They're both right.

1002
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:20,790
We both got solutions to work
and like, if you see

1003
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,690
someone's stuff, their code and
it's not how you do it,

1004
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,000
just have them walk you through
it and be like, oh yeah,

1005
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:28,890
that is how it could work.

1006
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,550
Bekah: Yeah, I love that so
much.

1007
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,700
And I, uh, with my background
being in English, I always

1008
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,600
like, think about it in terms of
literature and writing.

1009
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,530
And so much of coding is, is
you're an author of something

1010
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,670
that's being written, right.

1011
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,290
There are different styles and
there are different

1012
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:49,530
patterns and ways of doing
things, um, that give you.

1013
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:53,685
Different feels, um, and can
provide different things,

1014
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:57,915
but there are many valid ways of
doing it and also fun.

1015
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:02,355
Like if you've ever written with
a person, um, if you've

1016
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:05,085
collaborated on a project, like
there's a negotiation,

1017
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,035
like it, it has to flow, right?

1018
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:08,595
Like it all has to sound the
same.

1019
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:11,145
And I think too, when you're
diving into a new code base,

1020
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:13,245
you might have come with.

1021
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:16,105
A certain style or even certain
bad habits.

1022
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:16,495
Right.

1023
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:19,345
And then you're working through
that like, okay, well, this

1024
00:50:19,345 --> 00:50:21,955
is, this is the style of this
project that I'm working on.

1025
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:24,205
And now I need to figure out how
to kind of

1026
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:26,095
translate that in my brain.

1027
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:29,004
And when you're looking at
people doing the same thing in

1028
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:32,125
multiple different approaches, I
think that can also really

1029
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:39,055
help you to understand, um, how,
how many different methods

1030
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:42,595
there are and inform your, your
own understanding and style.

1031
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:43,860
Marie: Yeah.

1032
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:48,330
I, I think like collaborating
with people, hearing how they

1033
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,290
work, seeing how they work and
just having all of that

1034
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,670
knowledge of different ways,
even not of the same thing,

1035
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,750
but like Kirk working on his
project, you working on your

1036
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:05,490
project and me pairing with Nick
on forum, seeing all the

1037
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,220
different ways you could set
projects up, it just helps,

1038
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,440
you know, that you can adapt.

1039
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:17,040
And learn new styles, learn or
just read other people's

1040
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,430
work and understand it can still
work, even if it's not

1041
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,140
exactly how you would set it up.

1042
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,630
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely.

1043
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,910
All right, Maria, I wanna thank
you so much

1044
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,140
for being here with us.

1045
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,300
Uh, this has been a great
interview before,

1046
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,460
uh, we end the episode.

1047
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,250
I just wanna make sure that I
haven't missed anything

1048
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,160
that you wanna talk about or
anything that you'd like to.

1049
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,150
Marie: No, I think, I think we
discussed it a lot.

1050
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,800
Not really sure what else?

1051
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,610
That's great.

1052
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,960
Bekah: I think this has been
really fantastic.

1053
