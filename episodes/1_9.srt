00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,280
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to season one, episode

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,870
nine of the Virtual Coffee
podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,050
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,620
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,649
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,380
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,950
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co host, Dan.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,590
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. This is
the last episode of our first

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,439
season. So we thought instead of
having a guest, we just talk a

10
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,109
bit about our own journeys to
tech and share some thoughts and

11
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,560
experiences spending the last
year with Virtual Coffee.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,320
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,500
like we start every Virtual
Coffee, we introduce ourselves

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,490
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,599
check-in question. Today's
question is, if you could choose

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,140
any fictional person to be your
imaginary friend, who would it

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,840
be? And why? We hope you enjoyed
this episode.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,560
Hey, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end
developer from a small town in

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,819
Ohio. And if I could choose any
fictional person to be my

20
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,900
imaginary friend, I've got
WandaVision on my mind, because

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,549
today is the series or season
finale. And so I'm going to go

22
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,390
with Wanda.

23
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:46,090
Dan Ott: Wanda. Hi, I'm Dan. I
am a front-end developer from

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,549
Cleveland, Ohio. If I could
choose any fictional person to

25
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:58,239
be my imaginary friend, I think
I would choose Chewbacca. He

26
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,450
seems he seems like really good
friend, you know, always got

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,590
your back, good copilot
whatever; can, you know beat

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,959
people up? Like if they are mean
to you and stuff like that.

29
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,259
That's useful, or at least
threaten to beat people up.

30
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,629
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I've got a
dog that looks like Chewbacca.

31
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,180
And so I'll just send her to you.

32
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,530
Dan Ott: Excellent. This is the
dog that you know, and jumped on

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,610
the counter and eats all your
food.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, she
had a bag of chocolate chips

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:35,639
this morning. But she, she might
be able to defend you. When one

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,849
of my kids caught the microwave
on fire she barked a lot. And

37
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,370
that was good. So that's
helpful. Let's see, that's

38
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,500
useful. I'll just send her up
later.

39
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,360
Okay, so this week's episode is
a little bit different than

40
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,800
other week episodes. This is the
last episode of season one,

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,819
which just means we're going to
take a couple of weeks off, do

42
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,319
some recording and get ready for
season two. And today, we don't

43
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,810
have a guest, we're just going
to kind of talk about how we got

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,250
started doing this. So in other
episodes, we get the origin

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,330
stories of our guests, usually.
And so today, we're gonna start

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,469
with our origin stories. And so
Dan, why don't you go first.

47
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,099
Dan Ott: Okay, so how I got into
tech, I sort of grew up having

48
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,530
computers, you know, around the
house, and started doing web

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,449
stuff in high school. So this
was, like 99 ish. 2000 I think

50
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,069
the first couple of things I did
were flash sites actually. So I

51
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,189
had like, I was in a punk band,
you know, in high school, and we

52
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,270
did a little like site. And some
web stuff. The fire flash was

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,539
fun, because I don't know
there's a lot of drag and drop

54
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:03,699
stuff that you could do cool
things with. And, and then

55
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,259
through college, I was I went to
college, as a computer science

56
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:13,719
major switch to English, because
I had a hard time with some of

57
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,800
especially the math and also
higher level computer science in

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,709
college got real boring, because
I wasn't really doing any

59
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,329
programming anymore. It was like
more theoretical stuff. And also

60
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:33,490
like assembly language, which is
not very fun for me, and but on

61
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,339
the side, I was kind of
continuing to do more web random

62
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,740
web stuff. And at some points, I
don't know, at some point in

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,310
there when I was in college, did
a couple for pay sites or you

64
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,079
know projects for people and
that was kind of fun. And I

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,639
ended up dropping out of
college. Not really to pursue a

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,870
career or anything like that,
but I was struggling in college

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,290
for a lot. Different reasons and
when I got home, so I moved in,

68
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,800
you know, back home with my
parents, and there was a sort of

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,500
family friend that had was
starting a local newspaper. And

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,029
so the Lakewood observer, and I
started just working for him and

71
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:22,930
doing that, and went pretty
well--did not pay very much. And

72
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,490
I didn't really know that it
didn't pay very much. But also I

73
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,970
was, you know, 20, whatever, and
just living with my friends.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,029
And, you know, it was it was it
was fun, and started working for

75
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,720
Sprokets,  around 2007, I
think--Sprokets is another

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,009
independent kind of group that I
don't know they do projects for

77
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,459
clients. And so I was doing
front end for them and have been

78
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:56,709
doing front end for them since
then. And I don't know, and

79
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:03,009
then, now we're here. So I don't
remember exactly when it was,

80
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,779
but some couple years ago, I
guess I thought we, I could use

81
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,069
some extra help with some
Sprokets work. And so right

82
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,459
around that time, I saw Bekah's
tweet--I wasn't even following

83
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,610
you on Twitter, somebody
else--and I keep meaning to go

84
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,430
and track down who it was--but
somebody you know, shared, your

85
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,579
looking for a job, you know
tweet, you know just graduated

86
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,779
from--I always want to say grid
iron.

87
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:29,860
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Flatiron.

88
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,660
Dan Ott: You know, and so I just
I think DMed your reply on

89
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,540
Twitter, and and so you were my
first like, contractor,

90
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,529
subcontractor or whatever. So we
start working together and then

91
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:54,290
and yeah. Yeah, and then right,
so and then we got to when the

92
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,579
pandemic started, and all of my
work dried up, which meant, of

93
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,269
course, all of Bekah's work
dried up. And so we had to sort

94
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,199
of stop working together for a
little bit. Which it turned out,

95
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,319
worked out pretty well, because
I think that's when Bekah

96
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,290
started. Virtual Coffee. Yeah,
and so I obviously, we were

97
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,480
still friends. And you know, you
were doing the Virtual Coffee

98
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,889
thing. And so I, I don't know, I
think I came to the third or

99
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,560
fourth one that you did
something like that. And so

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,910
that's how I found out about
Virtual Coffee, as well. And

101
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,329
yeah, so yeah, so that's my,
like, sort of long winded tech

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,319
and Virtual Coffee origin story
on on one story.

103
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:42,089
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: All mixed
together. Yeah, so my first

104
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,319
experience with coding,
actually, so I have an English

105
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,829
degree. And my first job--I
wanted to be a lawyer for my

106
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,939
entire life. And then I decided
in my last semester of undergrad

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,910
that I didn't want to be a
lawyer anymore. And so then I

108
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,850
was just kind of left like, "oh,
what am I supposed to do?" And

109
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,250
so, I ended up, I taught adult
education for almost a year. And

110
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,399
then I got a job as a community
organizer. And I planned to go

111
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,550
to grad school for English. But
while I was a community

112
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,670
organizer, one of my first
tasks, my boss was like, "Okay,

113
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,569
I need you to go home and learn
HTML and CSS this weekend." And

114
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:26,610
I was like, Okay. So, my, I
don't know if he was my

115
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,009
boyfriend, or my fiance at the
time, Jesse, who is now my

116
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,840
husband. And he had taken a
bunch of CS courses. And I knew

117
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,659
he had some books. I was like,
"Can you teach me HTML and CSS?"

118
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,899
And literally, we just like,
opened a textbook. And we're

119
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,139
looking through the textbook
over the weekend, and I came in,

120
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,690
on Monday, I was like, "Okay, I
learned HTML, CSS." But I just

121
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,370
basically had to know how to use
Dreamweaver. And so you don't

122
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,029
need to know that to make the
site and I was just doing mostly

123
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,100
content updates, but
occasionally, there would be

124
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,879
like some weird thing that would
happen, and the template would

125
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,360
mess up. And then you would have
to go in and look at the HTML

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,429
and CSS. So, um, I did not
really like it. And I did not

127
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,779
want that to be part of my job.
But it was, um, and then I went

128
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,850
to grad school for English. And
I taught for eight years. And

129
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,090
then I went through a trauma
with my fourth kid, and it just

130
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,570
kind of like flipped my world
upside down. And so I was going

131
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,720
through all these mental health
things, and I had PTSD and I

132
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,899
didn't realize that I was just
like cycling these events over

133
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,019
and over in my head. And my
husband was like, "Hey, why

134
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,110
don't you learn to code?" And I
was like, "why would I learn to

135
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,120
do that? Because I can't even
think straight." Um, but I

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,299
finally just wanted him to shut
up so I started FreeCodeCamp.

137
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,350
The fun part of that was the
cycling thoughts stopped when I

138
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,690
was coding. So I don't know if
it was learning a new skill, or

139
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,129
if it was just my brain was
getting into hyperfocus in a way

140
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,940
that like shifted away from all
of those thoughts., but it just

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,370
became a huge form of therapy.
And I found a really supportive

142
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,210
community. I think, like, I had
signed up for Twitter, and I was

143
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,759
trying to be funny on Twitter.
And I'm like, not funny. So that

144
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,769
wasn't going so well, and so I
was like, okay, well, I guess

145
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm just gonna tweet about what
I'm learning about. And then

146
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,350
people were like, "Hey, good
job." And I was like, "Oh, cool.

147
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,110
I've got I've got
cheerleaders--that's fun--or

148
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:47,250
hype, people." Um, and I know,
just like having somebody being

149
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,820
encouraging, kind of like, okay,
I can keep going with this. And

150
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,299
then I found a group of moms who
were coding. And that was really

151
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,809
important. And one of them had
talked to me about her

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,559
experience with postpartum
depression, and how learning to

153
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,409
code really got her through
that. And that resonated with

154
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:09,149
what I was going through. And so
I ended up going to Flatiron

155
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,970
School. And I did that for a
year, I think it took me a year

156
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:23,220
to do that. Um, it's a part
time, remote, I can't remember

157
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,230
what it's called. It's like work
as you go kind of thing, right.

158
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,789
So like, there, there's, you set
your own pace, basically. And so

159
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,419
that works the best for me,
because I had kids at home, I

160
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:40,799
had a one year old, three year
old, six, and eight at the time.

161
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:48,720
And, and so after I graduated, I
felt 0% ready to apply for jobs.

162
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,620
And my husband was like, Hey,
you should just put it out

163
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,799
there. And I did. And then Dan
messaged me, and I thought, this

164
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,230
is this is not going to work
out. I am not ready for this.

165
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:08,399
Um, but then we had a
conversation and I felt really

166
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,759
comfortable. Like, okay, you
know, maybe I can do this. And

167
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,200
maybe I can work my way through
these challenges. And it was, I

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,059
mean, the first six months were
really rough. And just a lot of

169
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,549
like, second guessing myself,
and not knowing when to ask

170
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,960
questions. And then I feel like
we hit our stride, and then the

171
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,470
pandemic it. And then that was
really challenging. And that is

172
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,649
when I started Virtual Coffee,
because I started going to

173
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:43,320
interviews, and I never
interviewed before, because we

174
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,309
just basically had a
conversation. And the interviews

175
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,419
were horrendous. They were so
awful. And I just remember

176
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,779
thinking, like, you know, I need
to be able to talk to other

177
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,909
people. And so I just put it out
there on Twitter, and people

178
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:06,299
wanted to talk to, um, and so,
yeah, that's just kind of how

179
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:13,830
Virtual Coffee started. Because
I was having a hard time and I

180
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,730
needed friends.Yeah,

181
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,779
Dan Ott: yeah. Yeah, I mean, the
man, being able to talk to

182
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:31,429
people has been just so great.
It's been like the, I don't know

183
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,789
if it's like, I mean, this
probably isn't like news to a

184
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,600
lot of other people. But it was
sort of, to me, I, you know,

185
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,289
it's like, one of the things
that were, I didn't really

186
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,009
understand how much it was
affecting me not having it, you

187
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,509
know, being independent, my, my
whole career and even working,

188
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,419
like, working with Sprokets and
working with other groups at

189
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,309
almost all small, you know,
small organizations, and I'm

190
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,330
usually the only one doing the
work like, front end or

191
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,700
whatever, like, I'm only I'm
like working alone, even when

192
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,940
I'm working together. Right. And
having the, you know, having the

193
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,070
community I started, I like,
helped create the Cleveland

194
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,429
React meetup. Last, like,
summer or whatever that was 2019

195
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,370
I guess. And that was, you know,
really fun. It was the same

196
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,769
thing. I was just kind of, like,
just want to, like, I just want

197
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:33,769
to, like be able to talk to
people, you know. And, and, and,

198
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,669
yeah, and then Virtual Coffee
has been great, because it's, I

199
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,309
mean, Cleveland React is
awesome. But it's all you know,

200
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,740
just React stuff. Right? And so
Virtual Coffee is just a

201
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,169
collection of people in all
like, all different levels, all

202
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,789
different interests, you know,
we have, you know, people that

203
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,240
are front end people, we have
people that our back end people

204
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,850
you know, people are just like
learning for the first time, any

205
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,200
kind of code. You know, we have
people who have been doing for a

206
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,830
really long time, and you know,
I don't know, it's, it's great,

207
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,159
it's just so great to have a
collection of people like to

208
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,539
just talk, you know, talk to you
about things and share things,

209
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:11,840
you know?

210
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,100
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, yeah,
and, you know, one of the, one

211
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,100
of the things that I like a lot
about Virtual Coffee is that how

212
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:23,450
willing everybody is to share.
So it's not just technical

213
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,970
things that they're talking
about, but we do have people

214
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,929
from all over. And so, like to
learn about DevOps, or to learn

215
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,779
about management, those are
things that I don't know that I

216
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,440
would really get to understand
anywhere else, but then also to

217
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,500
hear them talk about their
challenges, whether that's, you

218
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,350
know, in their personal life, or
at work those things, I am, I

219
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,899
think, helped me to really grow
a lot, because I'm looking at

220
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,309
this, this person, and a lot of
times what we see online,

221
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,460
especially, you know, as someone
who learned remotely, and has

222
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,529
always worked remotely, you
don't get a lot of to see a lot

223
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,620
of like, the frustrations or,
you know, all of the other

224
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,240
things that come with being
human because people put on

225
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:15,139
social media, like they're
curated personality or whatever.

226
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,500
And so to see, all of that is, I
know, has been really great to

227
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,559
understand that we're not just
what we see online, you know?

228
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,409
Dan Ott: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
I, you know, and that idea has,

229
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,590
even come up here on the podcast
with some of our other guests,

230
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,120
you know, that same thing. I
mean, I don't have much more to

231
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,159
add to it. But yeah, I mean,
like, that's it, right. I mean,

232
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,120
it's just like, the, we're not
just like, you know, putting our

233
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,269
best, whatever faces on, you
know. And it's, it's hard to do

234
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,259
sometimes, you know, it's, it's
hard to do, excuse me, some

235
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,049
people can do it really well,
even just on Twitter, you know,

236
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,389
to share this, like, like that.
I, I struggle with it, you know.

237
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,190
And so when I don't have
something like perfect and fancy

238
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,970
to show off, I usually just
like, just don't say anything on

239
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,730
Twitter. And it's hard. I don't
know, it's, I don't feel like I

240
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,990
always have to be like that, you
know, here, or Virtual Coffee,

241
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,220
etc. Especially, just the zoom
meetings, you know, I mean,

242
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,630
like, slack is great. It's like
so, you know, on Virtual Coffee,

243
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,049
we have this slack conversation,
that's pretty much always going

244
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,660
but the coffee's, you know,
twice a week are like, where we

245
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,269
really just get to, like, hang
out, you know, and talk. And

246
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,700
we're not like presenting,
nobody's presenting and nobody's

247
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,559
you know, doing anything like
that. And it's just people kind

248
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,319
of talking and following, like,
letting the conversations kind

249
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,680
of flow. And like, as if we were
actually just having coffee to

250
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,000
get there. And, it's nice.

251
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,279
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I was
in Glenn's breakout room a

252
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,339
couple of weeks ago. And I loved
how he described it. He was

253
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,500
like, let's just pretend we're
sitting around a coffee table.

254
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,109
And we're all just like,
sharing, like, "We're friends

255
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:17,160
here." Right? And that's, you
know, initially, Virtual Coffee

256
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,920
was so much of that. It was just
like me coming into zoom and

257
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,319
saying like, Oh, I'm really sad
right now. And I just spent all

258
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,230
last night crying. That's like,
been my theme for the last year.

259
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,230
I cried today. Um,

260
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,039
Dan Ott: --yeah, but it's been a
rough year.

261
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,519
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's been a
rough year. But also, like, it's

262
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,190
a group where we can, I can feel
comfortable, at least like

263
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,450
saying that stuff out loud.
Somebody messaged me last night

264
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,309
or this morning, and they were
like, thank you for talking

265
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:53,029
about crying, because I am
always afraid to cry in front of

266
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,549
people. And like, that
definitely was me too. And now

267
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:59,029
it's just think I had like three
meetings this week. And I just

268
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,890
cried in all three of them. Was
having a rough week, and like, I

269
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,849
don't want to spend emotional
energy trying to not be human

270
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:14,180
right now. So I'm, I'm very
appreciative of the supportive

271
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,549
environment that allows me to be
able to be human in those

272
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:20,329
moments.

273
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,390
Dan Ott: Yeah. I think that's
great. I think that's a great

274
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,700
way to frame it too. You know.
And it's really, I mean, we've,

275
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,170
we've, we've come to it sort of
organically, you know, over the

276
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,609
last year, but that like a lot
of people to just be people you

277
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:43,099
know, and not like developers or
job seekers or whatever else,

278
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:49,190
you know, x thing. And just like
a lot of us have similar, you

279
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,519
know, things we're dealing with
or whatever but the whole point

280
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,900
of Virtual Coffee is, is more
just like, you know, providing a

281
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,710
space right to be an actual
person, another 10x developer,

282
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,190
whatever.

283
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,809
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: --or robot--

284
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,210
Dan Ott: or a robot in general.

285
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,789
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Okay, so
one of the things that I think

286
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,940
is really complicated about the
past year, right, with the

287
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,500
pandemic, and all of this stuff,
it's been such a hard time. And

288
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,559
there have been a lot of
struggles. But I always feel

289
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,619
like it's super weird when,
like, good things are happening

290
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,750
at the same time, right? Um, and
so like, out of this year,

291
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,410
Virtual Coffee started, and
we're about to hit on April 9,

292
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:47,220
that will be our one year
birthday. And March 23, I think

293
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,960
we'll hit our 100th Coffee chat.
And so we're hitting some big

294
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,170
things. And it's super exciting.
And it's always like, very weird

295
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,529
to frame that in, like, all of
the rest of the hard stuff

296
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:04,799
that's going on. And, but I
think it's been, I don't know, I

297
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,009
don't know what I would have
done without Virtual Coffee in

298
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,970
the last year and like, trying
to remember like, okay, there's

299
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,630
a lot of hard stuff that's still
going on. But like, it's, it's

300
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,390
okay to feel good about things
in the midst of the hard stuff.

301
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:22,859
Does that makes sense?

302
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,569
Dan Ott: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
And I think that's really

303
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:29,920
important. I, I mean, you know,
I agree about Virtual Coffee.

304
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,650
And also, like, we, so, you
know, I have I have two kids, I

305
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,410
have a almost five year old,
right, and a two year old. And,

306
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,700
you know, that's been really
hard with the, with the

307
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,490
pandemic, the quarantine and all
that stuff. But also, I mean, we

308
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,130
have, like, spent a lot more
time I think together, you know,

309
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,440
than we would have, right,
because they were in daycare,

310
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,359
and then they weren't for a
couple of few months. And then

311
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,839
right, like, for instance, right
now, like, We're one of their

312
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,569
teachers, I think tested
positive. And so we had to

313
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,910
quarantine for a couple weeks.
And, you know, it's hard, like,

314
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,259
we have it stressful and hard
because of work and, you know,

315
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,549
trying to get everything done.
But also, I don't know, I'm

316
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,740
hanging out with the boys again,
you know, like, just during the

317
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,460
day, everyday instead of, you
know, after after school, and

318
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,410
then weekends, and, and there
are like pros to that too. You

319
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,450
know, so like, I tried like it
like trying to not get trying to

320
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,529
remember, like, all the good
things, or any good things, you

321
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,009
know, positive things that have
happened in during a hard time,

322
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:41,890
I think is is valuable and
important, you know, because it

323
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,170
can be it can be easy to get
really caught up, you know, in

324
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,789
the the bad, right of any, you
know, of any situation, really,

325
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:52,329
but I mean, this this, I mean,
it's a global pandemic, we're

326
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,589
all kind of going through it,
you know, some, I think it's, I

327
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:01,089
think that like, it's it's an
important thing to be able to

328
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,970
recognize positive things that
have come out of it, you know,

329
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,539
maybe Virtual Coffee wouldn't
have happened, had that not

330
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:09,039
happened? Or maybe it would
have--

331
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,849
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: --had you
not fired me Virtual Coffee

332
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,799
would not have happened.

333
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,289
Dan Ott: I wait, I did not fire
you. And this is you just need

334
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:19,799
to stop saying.

335
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,890
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I only say
it just because it bothers you

336
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:32,579
every time.
It's like, my 11 year old will

337
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:37,769
just like stare at my six year
old in the car. And I freaked

338
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:40,109
out, right. So that's what I'm
doing? No, but um,

339
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,250
Dan Ott: so I'm the 6 year old
in this conversation. makes

340
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,609
sense.

341
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,759
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Sorry, I
didn't mean it like that.

342
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,460
Dan Ott: No, no, that's fair.

343
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,450
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Or my four
year old taunts my 11 year old

344
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,720
and he gets upset. So you can be
my 11 year old if you want.

345
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,720
Dan Ott: In our house, it's it's
very much always the two year

346
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,019
old who is bothering the five
year old, you know, who is like,

347
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,950
twice the size and you know,
really could just do anything,

348
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,839
you know, but he's just too, I
don't know, nice or whatever. Is

349
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,349
Samson just chasing around or
stealing his toys or whatever.

350
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,680
Anyway, sorry, I interrupted
you. You were you're heading off

351
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
in a different direction there.

352
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,940
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: No, what I
was gonna say was, like one of

353
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,210
my favorite things, I think,
that's come out of Virtual

354
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,349
Coffee too has been the podcast.
I have wanted to start a podcast

355
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:39,000
for probably over a year. But I
was always afraid to do it. Or

356
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,509
like, I don't know how to do any
of that stuff. I'm not going to

357
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,589
be able to do it. And then I
think somebody asked in Slack, I

358
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:51,509
want to say it was Cameron--who
was in the mental health episode

359
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,390
a couple episodes back-- "So
when is Virtual Coffee starting

360
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,490
a podcast?" And I was like,
"we're doing it!" right? And

361
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,750
then, Dan, you're like, "Yeah,
let's do it." And so then, like

362
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,099
suddenly something that I had
been thinking about for a year

363
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,789
in my head, like all of, going
through all these things, then

364
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:14,039
we suddenly just did it. Right,
we have just jumped into it. Um,

365
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:19,019
but it's been, it's been a lot
of fun to be able to do this and

366
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,069
to like, look forward to talking
to members. And I mean, it was a

367
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,119
little bit rocky, I think, at
first when we were trying to

368
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,319
sort through everything that
needed to be done and how we

369
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,819
should--what the process should
be. But like, once we kind of

370
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,049
figured that out, it just, I
don't know, it just became like,

371
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,690
one of the the highlights of my
year.

372
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,410
Dan Ott: Yeah, I mean,
definitely, I agree, like the

373
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,049
being on a podcast is is, I
mean, I don't know, I don't know

374
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,970
if it's like some kind of thing
that I've always wanted to do,

375
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,569
or whatever. But I definitely,
it always sounded fun, you know.

376
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,039
And I like talking to my
friends. And, you know, I like

377
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,609
sharing things and, like audio
editing stuff. I mean, I did, I

378
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:10,079
did some of that just on a hobby
level. For a long time, too. You

379
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,230
know, in college, we made videos
or whatever. And so it was kind

380
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:19,920
of fun learning about some of
those tools. I found this MAC

381
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,059
app called Hindenburg and for
audio editing, like, I don't

382
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,039
think anybody's ever heard of,
except that it seems like it's

383
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,660
also really popular. So I, I'm
not sure. I'm not sure how I

384
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,359
found it or where it came from.
But I mean, or like, where I,

385
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,779
you know, how I ended up with
it. But it's a cool, it's a cool

386
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,940
app, and that it's like learning
about that it's like learning

387
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,299
about audio editing and learning
about podcast hosting and

388
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:47,190
learning about all this stuff is
just like, this whole block of,

389
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,420
like, experience that I know,
that I that I didn't have

390
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,140
before. And now I you know, not
that I I'm, I still consider

391
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,039
myself a hobbyist at any of it,
you know, obviously, but I don't

392
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,740
know, it's been fun. I mean,
from the technical side has been

393
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,579
fun. And then yeah, just being
able to, like, share what I

394
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,490
don't know, sure what our
members are want to talk about,

395
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,430
and be able to, like have these
smaller conversations, and you

396
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,380
know, share them out with the
world in this format has been

397
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,839
really fun to that idea of like,
we have an idea, and then we

398
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,710
just kind of decided to go with
it has been like one of I feel

399
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,029
like are hallmarks in Virtual
Coffee for you know, for better

400
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,019
and worse, usually better. But
like, it's been out and it's

401
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,259
been it's been fun. It's kind of
like how a lot of the, like, big

402
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,359
successful things that we've
done. I mean, I say big,

403
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:48,839
relatively big, big for us have
gone, you know. I, I wasn't in

404
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,980
the room, so to speak, when the
Hacktoberfest stuff like, like,

405
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,579
when that conversation started,
you know, but you guys like,

406
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,009
asked me to help out with
Hacktoberfest pretty soon. And

407
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,920
then we just kind of like, like,
yes, we're doing this, and we're

408
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,670
gonna make it awesome. You know?
And we've never looked back

409
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,380
really, you know, say with the
lightning talks, you know, that

410
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,690
was, you know, it was just like,
okay, we're doing lightning

411
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,839
talks the end of this month. And
we're like, "Alright, cool.

412
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,779
Let's do it." I don't know.
We'll figure it out. You know,

413
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,589
we'll do it live. It was
awesome. Like this lady talks in

414
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:30,150
November. We're amazing. I was
trying to make a list of I mean,

415
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,849
we could do this later, we had
one of our members asked just

416
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,130
for the podcast, like, Well,
some of our favorite things that

417
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,799
happened, you know, and those
lightning talks in in November

418
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,599
were really fun. You know, like,
it was great having the, the,

419
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,160
you know, our members, kind of
do all these like amazing little

420
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,339
talks. And I don't know, is fun.
And also, I learned how to do

421
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:57,180
livestreaming on YouTube. Which
is something I didn't know how

422
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:04,319
to do before. You know. It's
been fun. So, yeah, so I don't

423
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,529
know,

424
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,299
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: The whole
October. I mean, really, it

425
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,710
started, like late August. I
think with all these things. I

426
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,789
don't know, I want to say that
maybe we should do something for

427
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:22,660
Hacktoberfest, but not ever had
dreamt up what we ended up going

428
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,630
with, right. And so you had been
saying for a while, "okay, if

429
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,779
you if you need some help with
it," and at that point, we were

430
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:36,099
working together again, I think,
um, and so, I was like, "Okay,

431
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,490
well, you know, I'll see if if
Dan wants to help with this

432
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,509
too." And then we brought Kirk
on and Sara and Bryan, I think

433
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:47,349
had already talked about it. And
then suddenly, it just became

434
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:50,289
this really big thing with
mentors and supporting

435
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,430
maintainers. And having our
contributors and you know,

436
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,349
having a site--you totally redid
the site. So so we could have a

437
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:03,970
Hactoberfest first issue. Um, so
it was just I don't know, so

438
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:09,670
amazing, but also super
challenging because we were, you

439
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,609
know, kind of winging it. And in
the beginning, like, what are we

440
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:16,599
going to do, lots of
brainstorming. And then, I don't

441
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,029
know, you just got all of this
stuff up and going. And it was

442
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:29,380
challenging to, I feel like I
this is, like a point, in the

443
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,809
last year, that was super
pivotal for me to be able to

444
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,430
have conversations that were
harder for me to have. So I'm

445
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,130
generally like, Oh, this is a
hard conversation coming up. So

446
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm just gonna, like, turn
around and just not talk to

447
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,450
people until it passes over, or
they just don't talk to me at

448
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,279
all anymore. Um, but it's much
harder to run from people when

449
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:58,990
it's on the internet. So having
these conversations that were

450
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,900
hard that I didn't want to be
having, and so it was just like,

451
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,230
forcing me out of my comfort
zone. And Hacktoberfest was

452
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,329
great. And afterwards, I was so
proud of everything that we did,

453
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:18,549
and all of our members. And
then, as we were, it took a lot

454
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,009
more time and effort than I had
thought. And then somebody

455
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,470
mentioned like, "Hey, didn't you
say we're gonna do lightning

456
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,259
talks in November?" It's like,
"Yes, I said that. And yes, we

457
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:40,029
will." No process nothing. I
kind of thought that I had some

458
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,490
people that were going to help
with that, that couldn't help.

459
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,809
And so then I was just, you
know, muscling through it. And

460
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:51,640
then Dan, I think you were like,
"hey, um, do you need some help

461
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,269
with this?" I'm not good at
asking for help. And so that,

462
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,140
you know, that's another thing.
My instinct, my gut reaction

463
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,970
would be to say, "No, I've got
this, I don't want to

464
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,500
inconvenience you." But I think
it came off of Hacktoberfest.

465
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,509
And that was a perfect time.
Because, you know, I was able

466
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,970
to, you know, work through some
of these communication issues,

467
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:25,210
like I knew that I could trust
you, and that it would be really

468
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,180
great to have your help. And so
then, rather than saying, like,

469
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,099
"No, I don't want to
inconvenience you," I was like,

470
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:37,210
"Yes, please." And so that was
like, two weeks. I think that

471
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,720
though, in the final two weeks,
there was a lot of stuff that

472
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,170
that we put together. But it was
an I was so exhausted after

473
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,359
that. And I just wanted to lay
down for a week. And then I

474
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,809
started seeing everybody who
spoke tweet about their

475
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,109
experience and how proud they
were. And then I was just like,

476
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,220
"this is amazing. When are we
going to do this again?" You

477
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,400
know, Kyle, Walsh calls it the
post conference high And I was

478
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:14,259
like, Yes, that is it 100% It's
so stressful. And you are like,

479
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,990
I never want to do this again.
And then it's done. You're like,

480
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,309
That was amazing.

481
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:26,460
Dan Ott: Yeah, that sounds about
right. Yeah, well, ask for help.

482
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,589
I mean, that's been that's been
sort of a big thing that we've

483
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,410
been working on that. I mean, I
feel like you've been getting

484
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,900
personally better at asking for
help, but we're, you know,

485
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,009
trying to find ways to, I don't
know, make make it so everybody

486
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:42,029
can do everything, right, and
come up with some processes to

487
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:46,980
make things less stressful. And
because up until recently, I

488
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,900
mean, Bekah has really even just
like doing everything, all of

489
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,359
the coordinating everything and
talking to everybody and you

490
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,490
know, and it's been amazing, you
know, but like we we want,

491
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,569
always wants to do more. Right?
And there's, like, limits to

492
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,980
what we can do. Right. And so
that's been one of the things

493
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,280
that like we've been struggling
with recently, I feel like is

494
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,840
that's where I wanted to start
struggling with how to how to,

495
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:21,570
like how to best do it right, at
how to set up processes for

496
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,909
people and, and, you know, how
to, like, empower our members to

497
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:33,690
to do things. Cuz, I mean, we
always like wanted, everybody do

498
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,329
whatever they want, you know, on
their own, obviously, but like

499
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:39,480
we've we've had some Virtual
Coffee stuff, we we want to be

500
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,150
able to give them tools, you
know, so they can like do things

501
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,889
you know, and like we can
support them and and provide

502
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,909
guidance and mentorship in
certain situations, things like

503
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,679
that. So that's been like, I
think, on top of our minds, you

504
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,460
know, recently well, that and
also our most recent lightning

505
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,960
talks, which also, you know, I
mean, this was part of that

506
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,269
practice, right? It was, we had
a really awesome team of, of

507
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:12,809
members helping coordinate and
mentor our lightning talk

508
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:20,699
session. This past, was it last
Friday? Yeah. Wow. Okay, so that

509
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:27,599
seemed like, three months ago,
but I guess it's. Um, but yeah,

510
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,079
I thought like it went really?
Well, I, you know, I don't know,

511
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,289
we're gonna talk to them, talk
to our team. And, you know, see

512
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,320
what, what went well, and what
didn't, you know, I think we

513
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,320
have something like that
scheduled next week, which I'm

514
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
looking forward to. But yeah,
like, how did you feel? I mean,

515
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,510
how did you think this was
different for you? You know,

516
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,400
compared to last time, when you
just did everything?

517
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,840
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, so
this was, I mean, it was a great

518
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,539
experience, because I love
seeing everybody put in the time

519
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,210
and to support all of the people
who are speaking, right. And so

520
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,539
it's great to see the community
members, you know, really,

521
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,070
really having a chance to do a
lot of the things that that

522
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:18,650
we've been doing. And for me,
you know, I've never really been

523
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,840
in a position where I'm, like,
managing people, right. And this

524
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,210
felt a little bit like, so, you
know, I was the kid in school

525
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,289
that the teacher is like, you
have an assignment that's due in

526
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:39,980
six weeks, and I would go home
and do that assignment. And I

527
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,250
recognize that a lot of people
are not like that, right. And

528
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,840
so, um, there's like that
balance there. Right? Like,

529
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,889
let's give them the autonomy.
But at the same time, we are

530
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,570
trying to refine our process,
because before there was my

531
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:01,010
notes were like, not that great,
because I was just doing it. And

532
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,579
so now it was like, okay, so I
need to go back. And I need to

533
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,579
look at all these things, make
sure that they feel supported.

534
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,570
And there were definitely some
gaps that we missed in how

535
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,590
things should go. Or maybe there
was like a step that wasn't

536
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,139
clear, right. And that's part of
the process, it's going to get

537
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:25,159
better as we go along. And so,
for me, it was a lot of like,

538
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:30,170
trying to figure out, you know,
where I was needed, or how I

539
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,639
best could support people. And
then, you know, right before the

540
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,170
lightning talks, I had this, you
know, thing come up that I was

541
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,610
not expecting, and so I was
missing for the whole day before

542
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,659
lightning talks. I wasn't
available. And but I mean,

543
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:53,119
that's why you have a good team
and good structure. Right. Like,

544
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,809
you know, Dan, I know that I
messaged you, and you were

545
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:02,030
making sure that everybody felt
supported. And, and so I don't

546
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,139
know, I guess. So. This is my,
my long way of saying that, you

547
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:11,000
know, having good support is so
important. And making sure that

548
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,659
you you are allowing people the
opportunity to do things, but

549
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:19,760
also encouraging questions,
right? Because I think, you

550
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,599
know, especially as a newer
developer, that asking questions

551
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,630
can be really hard, because you
don't know if you should ask

552
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,869
questions, or, you know, if, if
you're asking the right

553
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:35,599
question, and in the same way
here, I think allowing people

554
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,119
the opportunity to ask
questions, that's what makes us

555
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,829
develop a better process,
because it's not about you know,

556
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,650
whether or not you know,
something, it's about us making

557
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,510
sure that it's clear for any
person that comes into the room,

558
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:54,110
that, that they can do this,
because it doesn't make sense

559
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,610
to, you know, depend on one or
two people to do all of the

560
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,309
things because if something
happens, and it doesn't go on,

561
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,789
like community is about
community, right. And so, I

562
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:07,820
think that, you know, I feel
very good about like being able

563
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,400
to refine this process. And so
we can do this again.

564
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:19,510
Dan Ott: Yeah, I've been, it's
been interesting. In there's,

565
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:25,510
there's a lot of similarities in
my mind to just software, open

566
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:31,570
source software, especially,
where, you know, one of the

567
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,610
things to figure out is, you
know, if you're going to have

568
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,260
like, when you're just
developing something for

569
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,289
yourself, it doesn't really
matter how, you know, like, you

570
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,619
can do it how you want and you
don't have to make every

571
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:47,590
decision, you know, clear and
you don't have to, you know,

572
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,789
write down specifically like how
you do things or how you want

573
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:56,139
things to be done, you know, but
as soon as like if you want

574
00:39:56,139 --> 00:40:01,090
people to help you, right then
then then you need to start

575
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,340
writing some stuff down, right?
And so this is like any open

576
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,300
source project, if you want
contributors, then you know, you

577
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,809
need to decide, okay, like, what
do you want them contributing

578
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:15,550
to? And how, right and if, like,
you care what code style they

579
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,780
use, for instance, right, then
you need to either write it down

580
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:24,820
or automate it, right? I mean,
like, you know, and, or decide

581
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,920
that you don't care. You know,
like, it, code has a nice thing

582
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,690
where, like, especially if
you're using GitHub, right,

583
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,179
where you can do a pull request,
right, so you can, like, start

584
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:38,650
to, you know, start to figure
out where you need to improve

585
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,559
your docs or what you know,
like, you know, discuss things

586
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,980
and, you know, things like that.
You don't always get that with

587
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,760
not software. Right. And, and so
yeah, so it just takes more

588
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,750
communication, and more, talking
more writing, things like that.

589
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:01,090
Just a lot of work. But I think
the reward is going to be, you

590
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,539
know, worth any amount of, you
know, work we can put into it,

591
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:09,489
because it's just gonna make the
community you know, like, the

592
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:12,099
Virtual Coffee community is,
like, amazing, because of all of

593
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,380
the people like already doing
amazing things, you know? And

594
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:22,960
it's, I don't know, I feel like,
we're in this cool place right

595
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,650
now where it is, you know, we're
trying to, like, work a bunch of

596
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,730
things out, but everybody's,
like, excited, we have people

597
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,920
that are excited about helping
and I can, you know, I don't

598
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,880
know, you can, like see some,
some really cool things coming

599
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,530
down, coming down the line, you
know, and a little bit. So I'm

600
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,550
excited about the where, where
we're heading with Virtual

601
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,030
Coffee.

602
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,110
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure. I mean, if you would have

603
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:57,599
asked me a year ago, if we would
still be doing Virtual Coffee.

604
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,539
Number one, I would would have
said no, like, I think this is

605
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,650
gonna stop probably this summer,
right. But we're still doing

606
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,159
twice a week coffees, we have a
newsletter, we have a podcast,

607
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,030
we have a Twitter account, we've
done lightning talks, we've done

608
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,860
a million brown bags, like we
now have project boards for

609
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,909
things, you know, like, this is
so far outside of anything that

610
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:30,900
I could have dreamt up. And it's
just so great, you know.

611
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,099
Dan Ott: So I have a question
for you. If you like, we're, I

612
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,010
mean, I know, I sort of know the
answer to this. But like, if you

613
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,500
were like, okay, I want to
create a community that has

614
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,469
like, full of amazing people and
does, like is producing these,

615
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,110
like this content on their own
and everything like that, but

616
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,110
you're starting from scratch,
you know, a year ago? Like,

617
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:57,030
like, do you think it is even
possible to do what we're doing?

618
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,929
If you had this, like specific,
like a specific, you know, thing

619
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:06,900
in mind? Or, I'm not sure if
this isn't really a very good

620
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,860
question. Like, I'm not sure if
you can follow what I'm asking

621
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,030
or not. But when you started, it
wasn't like, I'm building a

622
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,489
community. Right? When you
started it, you just wanted some

623
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:18,690
people to talk to you, right?

624
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,130
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Be sad
together.

625
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,219
Dan Ott: Let me sit together.
Alright, well, I'm glad you

626
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:27,659
didn't call it, you know, be sad
together club or something, but

627
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:38,699
might have been a different
community. But the the idea of I

628
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,739
don't know, I said, I was gonna
ask you a question that I just

629
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:45,750
keep kept talking. But I guess
what I was saying is like, the,

630
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,510
the, a lot of the stuff that's
happened has been happened, you

631
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:56,039
know, organically. And that,
like, organic creation versus

632
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,519
like, a very, like goal, or, you
know, driven like, goal

633
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,559
oriented, you know, creation is
it's kind of, you know, two

634
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,349
different ways of doing things.
And so I was, I guess I was just

635
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:10,199
like, when I thought, you know,
or if you've thought about that?

636
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,840
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, well,
I think like, I've got two kinds

637
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,800
of answers. Like, first of all,
I'd never would have started

638
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,550
Virtual Coffee. I think in any
other circumstance, like, there

639
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,179
were so many like the first, I
don't know, probably six months.

640
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:29,590
I can't tell you how many times
I was like, I do not know why

641
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:36,159
people keep coming to Virtual
Coffee. Like, I don't think that

642
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:42,579
I'm a great person to be like,
talking to people or to be

643
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:48,280
organizing these things. Like I
there was just a lot of self

644
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:53,110
doubt. And like, what what am I
doing? There are certainly

645
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,980
people here that could be doing
this much better than I am and

646
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,309
maybe I should just be like,
"Hey, why don't you do this,

647
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:06,039
because I'm just not that great
at it." And so I think like, you

648
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,059
know, if somebody was like, hey,
I want to start a community, I

649
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:13,059
would have been like, No way I
don't have the skills for that

650
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm definitely not good enough
to do that. And so I think like,

651
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:22,869
outside of happening
organically, it wouldn't have.

652
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:29,019
Um, but at the same time, I'm
also a planner, like, the last

653
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:35,710
year of just constantly growing
and pivoting and, um, has been a

654
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,590
challenge for me, but I mean, a
good one, right? Because like,

655
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:43,449
I'm growing with it, I'm, I'm
learning to let things go and

656
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:48,940
to, you know, apologize when I
need to, or not take a break,

657
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:56,349
because I need to learn that
one. But I, I like the idea of,

658
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,150
of having thoughtful processes
in place, that I can kind of

659
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,019
follow into this thing. And, you
know, one of the challenges too,

660
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:09,369
when I finally recognized at
Hacktoberfest, like okay, well,

661
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:15,789
we're a thing, and we're not
going anywhere. Um, maybe I

662
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,659
should start thinking about, you
know, what this should look

663
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:25,000
like. And so diving into, I did
like a deep dive into open

664
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,420
source stuff. And I really felt
like, okay, we are, we're, we're

665
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,269
kind of an open source
community, rather than, like an

666
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:36,070
open source project, open source
software, because we follow a

667
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:41,380
lot of the same. I don't know,
like guidelines or thought

668
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,980
processes, everybody is
contributing, we're giving our

669
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,190
time. And we're all growing in a
positive way because of it. And

670
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,889
then I was looking at other
communities, and I couldn't

671
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:57,969
really find any, like Virtual
Coffee, which was kind of like,

672
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:05,170
"Oh, no, I don't have a model
that I can look at." But also,

673
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,920
like, Hey, you know what, we're
doing something special here.

674
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:16,329
And there's a reason why people
are coming. And so trying to

675
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:20,710
embrace that is has been, I
don't know, like, really

676
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:26,500
important to me. But also, I
think that that's also one of

677
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,400
the reasons why I could have
never done it, because I would

678
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:36,610
want to have had more
guidelines. What am I supposed

679
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,829
to be doing right now. Um, but I
think like, we're on our way the

680
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,769
lightning talks was huge. I
mean, you put together like the

681
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:47,739
project board and broke down
issues and stuff. And that was

682
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,920
just like, okay, so to be
honest, anyone listening at

683
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,900
first, I was very resistant to
the project board.

684
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,539
Dan Ott: That's true

685
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,340
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I might
have gotten a little bit upset

686
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,440
about it and demanded, we stop
project boards.

687
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,610
Dan Ott: I just, I just I just
said he didn't have to look at.

688
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,360
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: But it
turned out so good. We're able

689
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,420
to organize and support through
things. So like, if I, I think,

690
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:23,320
could go back and start with the
issues broken down and the

691
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,739
project boards there, then
that's like, right now where we

692
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:30,340
are, I would have taken that and
with that, um,

693
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,110
Dan Ott: yeah, I mean, that's
been a really interesting thing.

694
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,110
I mean, for one thing is an
experiment, you know, I don't,

695
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,289
we're gonna meet and see how
other people, you know, felt

696
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:45,150
about them. I have found, like,
when I'm, I don't know, on my

697
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,409
own, I don't do any of this
stuff, you know. But as soon as

698
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm trying to work with other
people, I lose track of

699
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,150
everything instantly. Like, it's
just, I mean, that's how I mean,

700
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,289
that is just how my brain you
know, works or doesn't work. But

701
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:04,800
I, the project boards, any, any
sort of like, that board layout,

702
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,820
you know, is very helpful for me
to be able to visualize, like,

703
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,489
what's going on, you know, and
so I've been like, leaning on

704
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:14,880
them with, excuse me with
actually with your, you know,

705
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,929
like our work, like our, our
actual work work. And, and I

706
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:26,099
thought it could work pretty
well with some of this non code

707
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:32,369
related, but, but still task
related, you know, process like,

708
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,619
like the lightning talks, right.
So a lot of moving pieces, we

709
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:39,840
had, you know, a big team of
coordinators, and then also,

710
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,230
obviously, the speakers you
know, and a bunch of different

711
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,170
steps, you know, involved and
made a lot of help, and we had

712
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,670
people helping us figure things
out. So, I don't know so yeah,

713
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,570
so it was like a, I'm glad you
feel positive about them now.

714
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,610
You know, I like it really was a
lot of just me, you know, trying

715
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,949
to make it so I can understand
what was happening, you know, I

716
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:07,739
keep track of all everything
that was moving around. And I

717
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:14,670
will see how it goes. You know,
in the future I, you know, the I

718
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,250
like the board layout in general
for a lot of different things.

719
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,949
And people have used them for,
you know, I think we've talked

720
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:23,219
about using, like making some
roadmapy kind of things for

721
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:25,320
Virtual Coffee, like, you know,
some some wait some more ways

722
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:32,099
to, like, even just communicate
with the, with our members. With

723
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,610
like, aside from just specific
tasks and stuff like that, you

724
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:41,699
know. So they're just built into
GitHub, which we're, we're

725
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,550
already using some, say there
instead of Trello, or whatever.

726
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:49,800
external tool, you know,

727
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:54,280
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah. Yeah,
I will say, I think, you know,

728
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,139
the other thing, too, that's
been challenging, not having

729
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,969
thought through this community
is, we hit that point where,

730
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:08,199
probably in October, it wasn't
just like, I need to think about

731
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,380
what's happening right now in
Virtual Coffee, but it was

732
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,969
thinking about right now and
what's coming down the line for

733
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:18,579
Virtual Coffee. So you talked
about, like, you know, having

734
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,789
this this roadmap thing, and I
think it'd be awesome, if we can

735
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:24,550
get that up and out there.
Because there's, like, so much

736
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,429
thought that's going into, you
know, how do we support what we

737
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:31,059
have now, but how do we put
things in place to support where

738
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,559
we're probably going to go?

739
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:39,380
Dan Ott: Yeah. Yeah, I know, I
think it's gonna be good. Um,

740
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:43,639
before we wrap up, I thought
maybe we just like, can share a

741
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:48,170
couple of our favorite things
that that happened through the

742
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,780
year. I mean, we talked about
some of the big things. But

743
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,630
there's a lot of small moments
in there, you know, to over the

744
00:51:53,809 --> 00:52:01,789
last over the last year, or
almost a year. I was, you know,

745
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,519
we were talking about the first
lightning talks. And, you know,

746
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,710
when I was thinking about the,
this, this question, one of my

747
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:11,329
favorite ones was actually
Karen's lightning talk from the,

748
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:16,760
you know, her first time out,
and it was just like, it, it was

749
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:23,000
sort of, I think, her first
public speaking. And it was, I

750
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,980
don't know, it was just a great
talk, it was great watching her,

751
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,679
I knew she'd been working really
hard on preparing and, you know,

752
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,650
this lightning talk stuff was
just like, so crazy, you know,

753
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:35,539
very fast pace. And, you know, I
was behind the scenes, kind of

754
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:37,969
doing the controller stuff, but
I was also trying to watch, you

755
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:40,550
know, most of them, and then I
don't know, Karen just started

756
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,650
talking about is like, kind of
stopped and just like, sat back

757
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:48,949
and watched. And she was talking
about imposter syndrome. And,

758
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,280
and, as related to tech, I
think, and shared a bunch of

759
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:59,150
her, like, a lot of her personal
career and story. And, like,

760
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,289
that is just, like, stuck with
me, you know, as one of the

761
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:07,460
things that I look back on a
lot, and you know, feel very

762
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,880
good, I feel very good about.
And it's like, it's the easy,

763
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:15,949
that is the thing that pops in
my head first when I think like,

764
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,050
when when someone's like, Okay,
well, you know, there's cool

765
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:24,170
things that happen in Virtual
Coffee. And then this is

766
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,670
probably a little recency bias.
But similarly, in our last

767
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:33,380
lightning talks, Glenn did a
talk about transitioning to

768
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:38,090
being a manager from being a
sort of regular developer, and

769
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,349
it was in a similar vein, a very
personal, you know, story. And,

770
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,489
and, and he, you know, there
weren't slides or anything,

771
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,150
Glenn just kind of shared with
us and talk through some, some

772
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,780
different, you know, things to
think about, and how they

773
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,750
affected him personally. And
then. And again, it was just

774
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,909
like, this moment of, sort of, I
don't know, calm and, you know,

775
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:11,599
like calm reflection and sharing
that I feel like those to stick

776
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,139
my brain because, like, we have
moments like this a lot in just

777
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:19,639
the coffee's to like all the
time every week or twice a week.

778
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,750
But you know, of people just
sort of taking a minute and just

779
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:30,619
talking, you know, and sharing
and not about whatever tech

780
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:33,889
thing is happening and not
necessarily about any sort of

781
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:37,519
specific advice or anything like
that, but more just, I don't

782
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,150
know, sharing experiences and
how they've, like reflected on

783
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:46,550
them and you know, have they've
sort of how their experiences

784
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,860
have shaped their, you know,
current situation and I always

785
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,800
just appreciate those moments.
When I'm when I get them, you

786
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,010
know,

787
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,909
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: yeah, I
really love I do love quiet

788
00:54:57,909 --> 00:55:03,550
moments are really really
impactful. I think for me, you

789
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:08,079
know, just hearing people
thanking each other or not even

790
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,530
one of my favorite moment
moments, I think was at the end

791
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:16,449
of the first monthly challenge
was in November. And I just

792
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:21,760
thought, okay, November is
NaNoWriMo, National Novel

793
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,679
Writing Month, okay, and so I
don't even know, it was a couple

794
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:29,860
days before then, like, we're
gonna run this monthly

795
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,949
challenge. And we're gonna ask
everybody to work together to

796
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:36,429
write 50,000 words, because the
challenge is, for one person to

797
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:39,849
write 50,000 words during the
month, like, maybe we can all do

798
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:45,820
this together. Um, and so,
people, we didn't hit 50,000

799
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:51,010
words, but like, being able to
hear what everybody was talking

800
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,900
about, and people saying that,
Oh, yeah, I haven't written,

801
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:59,889
like some people wrote their
first blog post, some people

802
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,980
hadn't written in a long time.
And the only reason they did was

803
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,820
for the challenge, and then also
just seeing everybody just

804
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,320
willingly to willing to support
each other and to share, and

805
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,760
then to be like, what's next
month's challenge? Like, okay,

806
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,079
this is, you know, a really
wonderful, small thing that we

807
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:30,010
did to create community and to
see everybody looking at each

808
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,860
other's blog posts and saying,
I'd love this thing that you

809
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:38,289
wrote there was really special.
And in the same way, I think,

810
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:43,300
you know, anytime somebody
comments on the podcast, or they

811
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,289
give their favorite quote from
the podcast, those are also a

812
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:50,590
lot of my favorite moments.
Because, you know, they're,

813
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:54,010
they're listening to what people
have to say, and they're like,

814
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:58,510
wow, this really stuck with me.
And I know, probably after every

815
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,409
episode we've done, there's been
one thing that every person,

816
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,889
every guest, we've had, has
said, that I have thought about

817
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:12,670
the rest of the week. And it's
been so great to, you know, have

818
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:18,130
that and to have that personal
connection. So, yeah, like all

819
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:22,510
of the I mean, there have been
so many great moments, but just

820
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:28,539
those those unexpected ones, I
think, are the ones that, that I

821
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:30,940
just kind of like, keep close to
my heart.

822
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:38,159
Dan Ott: Yeah. I I agree. I it's
just been kind of it's been. I

823
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,159
mean, it's been, it's gonna say
it's been a great year. It

824
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:44,099
hasn't. I mean, it hasn't it
hasn't, you know, but I don't

825
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,210
know. It's there's like you were
saying before, it's weird to

826
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,449
say, it's been a great year,
because it's really been at a

827
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:55,590
lot of awful things happen this
year. But this Virtual Coffee is

828
00:57:55,739 --> 00:58:00,210
very clearly, you know, one of
the good things that has come

829
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,289
out of office.

830
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,940
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, for
sure.

831
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,409
Dan Ott: All right. Well, we're
going to take a couple weeks

832
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:15,559
break. Well, a few weeks, I
guess. And I think we're going

833
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:21,170
to do four seasons. year, when
we were talking about this Bekah

834
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:26,510
asked if you could have four
seasons in a year. And I said,

835
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:32,630
Well, I think there are four
seasons. But

836
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,579
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I just
learned something new four

837
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,590
seasons in Ohio at least.

838
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,980
Dan Ott: Yeah, we have winter,
fake spring, second winter, fake

839
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:46,429
spring again, third winter, and
then spring for a couple of

840
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,980
weeks, and then it's 90 degrees.
That's really how it is in

841
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:54,920
Cleveland. But yeah, so we will
be back. Well, season two will

842
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,260
start first week of April and

843
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,440
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: right in
time for one year anniversary.

844
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,739
Whatever. One year, one year.

845
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,820
Dan Ott: It's an anniversary? I
don't know whatever. No, I

846
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,250
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: was. Yeah,
I'm having a hard time with that

847
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:12,110
Dan Ott: one year celebration.

848
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,409
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: we've been
around for a year.

849
