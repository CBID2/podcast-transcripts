00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:09,867
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode seven of

2
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:15,798
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,669
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:22,309
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,978
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:27,829
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,798
you. Here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

8
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:35,442
Dan: Thanks Bekah! Today we're
joined by Mike Rogers. Mike is a

9
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:39,673
Ruby developer from the UK. And
if you're a Virtual Coffee member

10
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:42,853
(and if you're not, you should
join), you've probably seen his

11
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,393
chatbots at work everyday in the
Virtual Coffee slack. Uh, which

12
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:50,143
we very much love and appreciate.
We had a really great time

13
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:53,472
talking with Mike. Mike has had a
long and successful career. But

14
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,232
at one point he realized he no
longer felt good or satisfied

15
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:59,622
with where he was as a developer.
He shared with us what he did to

16
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:02,472
change course and how he has
learned to approach tending his

17
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,433
career. Almost like a garden.
Mike has a lot of insights and we

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,033
had a blast talking to him. I
know you're going to enjoy it.

19
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:14,093
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

20
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:17,153
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

21
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:21,472
we're from, what we do in a
random check-in question. Today's

22
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:26,003
question is you can have an
unlimited supply of one thing for

23
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,533
the rest of your life, what is
it? We hope you enjoy this

24
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:41,968
episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I'm a
front end developer from a small

25
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:47,459
town in Ohio. And if I could have
an unlimited supply of one thing,

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,448
I'm, I'm going to say energy.
Cause I feel like there's not,

27
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,899
not like power for my lights, but
like for me personally,

28
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:01,213
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan I'm a front
end developer from Cleveland,

29
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,513
Ohio, and yeah. Uh, rest was the
first thing that popped into my

30
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:09,743
head. Um, I, uh, you know, I
don't know. I was just telling

31
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,854
Bekah before we recorded, I had
my two year old woke up maybe

32
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:16,123
four or five times in the middle
of the night, last night. Um,

33
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:21,493
and, um, just to, I just don't
have time. I don't know how time

34
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,653
would work. Like that was my
going to be my other answer, but

35
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:27,579
like, that doesn't...super make
sense. I don't mean

36
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,253
Bekah: dangerous. You're messing
with the space time continuum.

37
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:30,463
And I

38
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,258
Dan: I'm all right with that
though. I'm all right. Being a

39
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,368
time variant, you know?

40
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:35,713
Bekah: wow.

41
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,109
Dan: Well, like it's like almost
like a Time Turner or something,

42
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,389
right. Or like that, the pause
time thing. We've, we've, we've

43
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,669
talked about that. I feel like
before it's, it's come up a few

44
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,329
times. Um, but yeah, so I'm, I'm
going to stick with the rest

45
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,118
though, you know, um, our energy,
I suppose it's almost the same

46
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:49,929
thing, right?

47
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,514
Mike: Sounds like you kind of
this pitch red bull that if I'm

48
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:53,903
honest.

49
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,933
Dan: Yeah, well, that's right.
Yeah. It's a slippery slope

50
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:57,653
Bekah: what we want.

51
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:00,954
Dan: But I I'm, I'm going with
rest that's that's my official

52
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:01,044
name.

53
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,908
Mike: Okay. well, I'm Mike Rogers
I'm a Ruby developer originally

54
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,549
from the United Kingdom. I
currently live in the United

55
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,058
States, which is quite exciting
if I had an unlimited supply of

56
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:16,959
something, I want to say
enthusiasm. Um, because sometimes

57
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,419
I go through those little down
bits where I'm like, I can't be

58
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,179
bothered to code and I just wish
I could turn on something and be

59
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,549
like, no, now I really want to
code again. This is great. Or get

60
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,563
something done. That'd be me.

61
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,498
Dan: I liked that I was almost
going to say, like, you're just

62
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,739
wishing for something that you
already have, but, uh, that, that

63
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,318
explanation

64
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,933
Mike: I want more of the thing I
already have, please.

65
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:43,014
Bekah: Mike is one of the most
enthusiastic members of Virtual

66
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,713
Coffee. If you are ever in a room
with him and you are feeling

67
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:48,563
down, I don't think it's possible
to leave that room without

68
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:53,123
feeling happy. So I hope that you
get that from this episode too.

69
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:56,808
Mike: Always throws me off when
people say that, because everyone

70
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:59,269
says that and I'm like,
seriously, I'm just being myself.

71
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,679
Like, what do I do to people?

72
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,829
Bekah: It's the best you have.
You have the, the energy. So, I

73
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,943
guess my answer is just more Mike
Rogers in my

74
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:13,838
Dan: There you go. We just need
an unlimited supply of Mike and

75
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,709
we'll, we'll be in good shape.

76
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,639
Bekah: So we're so excited to
have you here with us on the

77
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,928
podcast. Thank you for being
here. And we always like to get

78
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:29,098
started with the origin story. So
tell us how you got to this point

79
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:29,908
in your life.

80
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,644
Mike: say I was really dreading
this because my story is so

81
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:38,363
vanilla that I was going through
my notes and I was like, I don't

82
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,994
think it could be any more
boring. It was a very typical

83
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:46,014
entry in to tech. Well, I was
building websites when I was like

84
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,973
little, like when I was like 12,
14, just in Dreamweaver. If you

85
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:54,173
remember that. Oh, tool from
Adobe. Oh, I loved it. I good.

86
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,624
And then I'd be like go to like
school and I'll show my friends

87
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,903
and then we'd all like start
building websites and have them

88
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:03,564
online for free. And then very
quickly I was like, Oh, I really

89
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:08,244
enjoyed this. This is really fun.
Then I went to university and I

90
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:12,173
had some identity CS degree, but
very focused on web. And that

91
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:15,774
was, that was great fun. And then
I just ended up kind of getting a

92
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,254
job, like vaguely and what I
wanted to do, like someone told

93
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,644
me Ruby on Rails is like quite a
fun framework. And I was like,

94
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,249
yeah. it does look fun. I done
some PHP, but then yeah, I think

95
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,928
did Ruby and it was like, oh, I
like this. This is, this is a

96
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,759
pretty language. So I was like, I
like you have an ice cream

97
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:34,829
Bekah: Okay.

98
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:38,048
Mike: be the best way to describe
my reaction to that. And then,

99
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,588
um, to kind of fast forward to
how I got to where I am now, I

100
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:45,069
had like a few years where, like,
I was kind of quite happy just

101
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,619
traveling around like the world's
kind of freelancing and doing a

102
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:51,264
bit of work. And more recently,
like I wanted to kind of get a

103
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,814
bit more stability in my life and
then have like a full-time job

104
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,754
where it's like, oh, I actually
get paychecks every month for

105
00:05:56,754 --> 00:06:00,923
like, doing work as opposed to
not getting paid sometimes as a

106
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,874
freelancer, which is very scary.
Um,

107
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:05,288
Dan: Yes.

108
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,939
Bekah: that's rough.

109
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:06,894
Mike: That's pretty much

110
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:10,134
Bekah: So were you a digital
nomad or.

111
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:14,454
Mike: Um, that was what I was
going for for like so long. I

112
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,093
really enjoyed, it was like the
best few years like all my life.

113
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,913
I was just like, I was just
jumping between like major

114
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,603
cities, but like, I find the best
in that I find amazing coworking

115
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:28,108
spaces and I'd just work and I'd
have such a good time. Um, I'm

116
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,759
also a quite anti-authority
person, so it's quite nice kind

117
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,699
of going against the grain and
finding people who are similar to

118
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,449
that. So I also got featured on a
magazine as well. I think he may

119
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,178
have seen the picture where I'm
just kind of sitting outside on

120
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:43,899
my laptop, just like working in
some of his like, ah, cool. I'm

121
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,988
going to right now to go about
you and I'm like, do it. And

122
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:47,619
Yeah. then she did,

123
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:52,384
Bekah: It's like at a top of a
very high place. And Mike is

124
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:53,704
sitting there with it.

125
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,793
Mike: Yeah. There was some other
shots as well. I also had a dog

126
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:58,603
with me at the time.

127
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,377
Bekah: Were there. Did you have
favorite places that you like to

128
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:06,346
work from or was your goal just
to go as many places as possible?

129
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,117
Mike: So originally my goal was
to go see all these places like,

130
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:13,427
which I'd read about in
magazines, but very quickly I

131
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:16,396
realized the places I wanted to
go as a tourist, was different to

132
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,937
where I want it to go to like
live for like a few months. So my

133
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:24,797
favorite places, like kind of in
no particular order Berlin, like

134
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:29,086
the city in Germany, um, there's
some really nice like meetup

135
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:32,237
groups there where they're so
friendly and I'm still friends

136
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,036
with the people I met in those
meetup groups. One of them

137
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,346
tweeted me yesterday saying we
miss Mike. And I was like, oh,

138
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:42,377
That's wild. And then, um, Prague
as well, I went to a wonderful

139
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:46,141
coworking space there. It was.
The owner was an American guy and

140
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,122
he's just like, I just wanted to
make friends. So I started a

141
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:51,512
co-working space and I was like,
I like, I liked this guy's same

142
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:56,252
mindset. And then, um, I tons of
actual, like crazy places. I

143
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,432
really enjoy Japan. Like it's a
bit more tricky to work there.

144
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:02,192
Like I guess working remotely.
Isn't, wasn't a thing when I was

145
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:06,512
there, but I've really enjoyed
just kind of this, the Japanness

146
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,141
of everything.

147
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,911
Bekah: So where you just were
the, were you working consistent

148
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,252
contracts that just kind of
allowed you to go to these

149
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,982
different places? Or were you
trying to pick up contracts as

150
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,281
you're moving? That just sounds
like a lot of logistics, like,

151
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,312
well, I need work and I need a
place to stay any place that has

152
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:26,512
internet, you know?

153
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:31,257
Mike: Oh, luckily I was young and
happy to wing it. Um, every time.

154
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:35,966
It was bad. In hindsight, I think
I was like a little bit crazy. I

155
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,777
didn't even have like any money
at the time, but like to cover

156
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,657
like places to live. I would like
do pet sitting where people would

157
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,746
go on holiday and that normally I
just feel so by who has the

158
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:49,456
fastest internet. And then I just
go to that person's house. That

159
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:53,386
worked really well. Um, and then
to actually find work, I had a

160
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:57,317
few like startups, I kind of knew
about who needed work every now

161
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:01,037
and again. And they would kind of
keep me going here and there. And

162
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:03,856
then sometimes I'd have to like,
do some really terrible freelance

163
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,586
work, which I hated doing where
it was like the stressful kind of

164
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,076
you, you wouldn't pick this
project unless you were like

165
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:14,042
really styling kind of freelance
work. Um, I always had this dream

166
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:18,062
and it was this, the worst dream,
like kind of go out with, uh, I

167
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,881
was like, I'd have enough energy
to make my own startup. And I

168
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,221
could be the guy who's just like
sitting on a beach and ending

169
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:26,402
like that passive income. And
every time I tried, I never quite

170
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:29,902
like finish any of the projects.
I had lots of fun.

171
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:36,442
Bekah: Yeah, that sounds awesome.
And really exciting. And so.

172
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:36,932
Mike: to live.

173
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,826
Bekah: You went from being a
digital nomad to kind of deciding

174
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:49,267
that you needed something more
stable and that, ahead. Talk

175
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:49,807
about that a little bit.

176
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:55,386
Mike: Yeah. So I started hitting
this problem and it was so it's

177
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,787
such an uncomfortable thing to
talk about, but when you're

178
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:00,246
freelancing, you generally are
going to stick to what you're

179
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:03,486
really good at. So with me, it
was like, okay, I'm really good

180
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:06,307
at this very small particular
thing. That's where I know I'm

181
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:10,731
definitely going to get. And I
kept doing that and doing that.

182
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:16,011
And I just felt like I wasn't
really making any progress in my

183
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:20,782
career. Like I'd hit like a, a
wall where the next place to go

184
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:25,162
was no, as like some kind of kid
who just turns up with his laptop

185
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,402
every now and again. And I got
super sad because I talked to my

186
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:33,892
friends who. Work together in a
company like many years ago and I

187
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:36,772
chat to them and then we'd be
comparing our salaries because,

188
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:41,481
you know, that's such a good
thing to do. And I was I'd come

189
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,761
back. And I was like, I thought I
was doing really well, but now

190
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:46,912
one of my friends is earning
twice as much as me. And he seems

191
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,272
so much more like stable in his
life. And he's where everything

192
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:53,572
kind of a bit more like just,
just a couple of his like Eggs in

193
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:56,451
a row. Is it egg ducks in a row?
That's the one not exited, right.

194
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,412
That would be horrific.

195
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,147
Dan: eggs eggs in a basket ducks
in a row

196
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,256
Mike: Yeah,

197
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:01,966
Bekah: Lux have

198
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:02,726
Mike: the one.

199
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,126
Bekah: can be in the row with
them.

200
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,361
Mike: And I started kind of
thinking, right. I really need to

201
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:12,532
solve this because if I don't
push myself, I'm going to be that

202
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:16,042
person. And I met a few of these
were traveling where I would chat

203
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,532
to them. And I just was like,
what are you doing? Like you're,

204
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:22,461
as soon as like, maybe your
technology goes, you don't have

205
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,371
anything to fall back on to. So
you could just wake up one day

206
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,402
completely unemployed and you'll
have to scramble to get work and

207
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:32,496
you don't have too much more. And
yeah, so I really. Really

208
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:35,317
struggled. So I thought the first
best thing to do is maybe come

209
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:38,616
back to the UK, settle down a
little bit, or try and find

210
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:42,336
something a bit more stable,
which was, uh, an exciting

211
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,307
adventure as well. Like I managed
to find some pretty, uh, pretty

212
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,996
fun startup to work for, which
was very relaxing. And, uh, they

213
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:52,476
kind of were able to change me a
little bit more. And I've really

214
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:57,216
got out of my like little quiet
shell of like, Okay. I can do

215
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,922
some little bits of rails, but
now. They're forcing me to kind

216
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:04,042
of learn all these other things
like server administration, how

217
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:08,302
to optimize databases, how to
really be fantastic at like front

218
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:12,711
end. And that was, that was quite
a fun one to, uh, to chase.

219
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,206
Dan: Was that a I'm sorry. I was
just going to say, was that, was

220
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,486
that still a contracting at that
point? Or was that like a

221
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,192
Mike: Oh, that was like a
full-time role. That was wild.

222
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,761
Um, that was like my first
full-time job. And like, I want

223
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:30,322
to say it was like three or four
years at the time. And, uh, yeah,

224
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,961
it was so weird. Like every day
it's like, oh, cool. I have a job

225
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,361
to go to. This is great. Um,
compared to where I'd ended up

226
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,932
and it was so fun, like kind of
looking back on the, kind of the

227
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:45,402
projects I had been doing, like
there's like a certain trait to

228
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:47,831
projects where they can only hire
people for like a short amount of

229
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,081
time. I'm sure you everyone has
like, kind of encountered this

230
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,697
where if they can only have a
developer for like three. Months

231
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:57,427
in a year, they're going to
really cram in what they have to

232
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,826
do, and they're going to triple
it really hard to get stuff done.

233
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:06,037
And very quickly projects become
awful to work on, like where it's

234
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:09,996
like, instead of like a nice
logically laid out CSS file. It's

235
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:13,447
going to be like all over the
show, possibly even one big like

236
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:19,767
cluster spaghetti mess. And so I
try, I'm very, very careful not

237
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,496
to make you put an explicit tag
on this podcast as the heads-up.

238
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:24,716
Dan: Yeah.

239
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,307
Mike: then Yeah. also some of the
products were so old. Um, and

240
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,527
then being able to kind of work
in a company and be like, Hey, if

241
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:33,027
we put some time into this, we
can, we can be way happier. And

242
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,927
like three weeks time, can we do
that? And then they're like,

243
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,057
Yeah. which was quite nice.

244
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:42,297
Bekah: So I want to back up for a
second here. So you talked about

245
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,947
Mike: I've like, run through
quite quickly. I'm like,

246
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:48,591
Bekah: no, no, this is great. Um,
This, you started to feel this

247
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,652
sense of there's a lack of
stability, starting to feel

248
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:55,192
stagnant, where you are. So at
what point did that happen? And

249
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:58,642
like, was it that conversation
about salary that really helped

250
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,761
you to understand that? Or how
did you recognize that?

251
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:06,871
Mike: It was a really difficult
thing to actually recognize. So

252
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:10,172
the conversation about like
salaries was the starting point

253
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,432
of like, getting that ball going
of going, oh no, I need to fix

254
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:20,692
some stuff. So as soon as I
started thinking, Okay. Actually

255
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,142
I've done very similar projects
and I'm not pushing myself

256
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,322
anymore. Like my career is like,
if you were to go look at my work

257
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,412
history, it's like I was doing
the exact same job over and over

258
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:35,542
and over, like was on a, on a
treadmill almost. And for a lot

259
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,822
of the jobs, I was like, I can't
even remember doing half of them.

260
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,851
I can see the paycheck there and
I can see the customer name, but

261
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:44,601
I couldn't tell you what was
special about that. And that was,

262
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,187
that was cool. It was quite
jarring as well, like really

263
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:51,216
strange feeling. And it's like,
huh, am I unhappy? Or what's,

264
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:54,697
what's causing this unhappiness
because it's, I'm not satisfied

265
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:59,197
with the work I'm doing and not
sure how to get around it. And I

266
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,956
kind of jumped the Cal ended up
kind of like solving it very

267
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:06,067
quickly there. But like, as soon
as I started becoming aware that

268
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,086
I needed to start pushing myself
a bit more and the steps I had to

269
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:15,261
make as well to correct that. Was
very, very difficult. Um, but it

270
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,751
paid off quite quickly. Um, and
I'd love to go into some of the

271
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,542
things I started doing as well.
Would that be Okay.

272
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:21,427
Bekah: Oh yeah,

273
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,861
Mike: cause it, it wasn't like I
got depressed and then I got a

274
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,721
job. That was a lot of the
middle. It was like,

275
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:30,572
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I
think, you know, once you

276
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:33,302
recognize, start to recognize
these things, like you said, it

277
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:37,042
wasn't easy. There was a. You
know, a variety of things that

278
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:41,751
had to happen. And so recognizing
is step one and then really

279
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,261
diving into that middle part, I
think is important because we

280
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,711
often get the stories of, well,
then I decided I made this

281
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:52,341
decision and then everybody fast
forward through all of the hard

282
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,532
parts of things. So I would love
to hear

283
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:57,491
Mike: Yeah. Let's jump into the
hard part. So I want to say like,

284
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:03,432
The lowest point I had was I
remember the sitting in bed one

285
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,761
morning and I woke up and I was
like, I don't even want to put my

286
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:10,871
feet on the floor. I'm so
miserable and unhappy with just

287
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:14,442
the state of things. It's a
really weird feeling to be like,

288
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:18,731
oh, I'm earning quite good money
doing something. I think I quite

289
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:23,591
like, but I don't even want to
like, literally roll, put my feet

290
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,721
on the, and press the power
button on my computer this

291
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:32,376
morning. Like that is too much.
that was definitely a morning. I

292
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,326
remember the morning really
distinctly, whereas it's like,

293
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:38,076
oh, this is, this could go
downhill really fast. And I was

294
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:41,616
even thinking, do I want to leave
tech because do I enjoy

295
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,307
programming for fun and actually
getting paid for it. is the

296
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:49,251
issue. And, Um, then I remember
actually I really like the money.

297
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,491
That's that's, that's definitely
a good motivator. So I was like,

298
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,062
it's probably not that. And I
quickly made a list of all the

299
00:16:56,062 --> 00:17:00,547
things I wanted to be. Very soon
on it in the future, I was like,

300
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,966
well, what are, what is some
small bit of all the people I

301
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,817
follow online or really like,
what's something small they've

302
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,686
done, which I really want to
copy. So one was I follow a

303
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:13,656
developer who he contributes a
lot to open source and I was

304
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,237
like, okay. well, I don't have to
contribute a lot. I can just

305
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:19,747
maybe contribute just a little
bit and have my little piece

306
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,586
there. And then I started
watching YouTube tutorials a

307
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:27,787
little bit. And there's a
particular guy that's into Chris

308
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,666
Oliver. I always really liked his
style where he just does a quick

309
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,426
10 minute video every now and
again. And I was like, Okay. I

310
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:37,656
really like that. then the final
thing, I was like, well, all of a

311
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,332
sudden. I also want to make sure
I write down the things I know

312
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:44,721
just in case I get really bored
and no one finds my videos and

313
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,001
then we'll find some way
principles work. So at least

314
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,491
maybe some of them I can at least
solve someone's problem. If I

315
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:52,221
don't stick on with this depth
stuff. So I started like blogging

316
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:55,432
again, and you can see it in my
blog post, by the way, you can

317
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:58,761
see like the dips as like, when I
was taking breaks and then

318
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,221
suddenly, like I started doing
stuff again, and then it like

319
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,011
quietens down a bit while I have
a job. And then it's like, ah, I

320
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,531
have to take it back off again.
Now I want to like do more stuff.

321
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:10,196
But that was, that was kind of
the main things I was doing. So I

322
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:15,576
made this list and I started
working through the list. And as

323
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:17,346
I started working through, I
started talking to my friends

324
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,497
about this and turns out they
were all in the same scenario

325
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:24,636
where they were all like, not
quite satisfied and they're all

326
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:30,172
working. On the little things to
try and like boost their careers

327
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:34,041
and get to that next level where
they can just do interesting,

328
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:37,162
challenging work, where they're
gonna get paid pretty well. And I

329
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:41,751
have a really good friend called
Tom Cadwell and we, we worked

330
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:45,892
together when we were 20. We
paired every day and then we both

331
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:50,511
went our separate ways. And then
we've texted like pretty much

332
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:55,686
once a week about what we're
doing. And. He's like, he's like

333
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:58,737
me to other how people would
describe me to other people. And

334
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,997
I'm like, really, Jerry he's that
for me? And it's like, cool,

335
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:05,196
cool, nice. And we have like a
bet between us, like dollar bets

336
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,717
for like, who's going to get the
most followers on certain things

337
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,237
or he's going to get the most
views. And that was really

338
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:14,817
brilliant. Up. It's like, well,
helped me kind of keep sticking

339
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:18,836
with the things I was doing. So
like, I think Right. now we have

340
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:22,977
a bet for, who's gonna have the
base of YouTube followers by the

341
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:26,126
end of the year and he's winning.
So I really want to work hard to

342
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:30,356
fix that. Um, but so once I kind
of side working through this

343
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:35,576
anyway, and felt more confident
to apply for those harder jobs

344
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,946
where maybe I might actually be
challenged a bit during the day.

345
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:43,402
And cause it's, I hate applying
for jobs. It's like the worst

346
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,912
experience. If you it's like,
it's almost like dating apps

347
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,461
where it's like, you're going to
be rejected thousands of times

348
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:52,821
and that's gonna like destroy
you, but it could be that one

349
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,821
thousands times actually the
perfect person for you. So you

350
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,721
kind of have to stick with it. So
like, I would apply for jobs and

351
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,051
I'd keep upping the ante each
time and I'm like, Okay. I know a

352
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:06,501
few of these things and I'm going
to do everything I can to do it.

353
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:12,116
Or. Feel competent about what I'm
applying for. So that worked

354
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:15,836
quite well. And as I was doing
this, I found the best way to

355
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,507
find out about Joseph was through
local meetups and stuff. So user

356
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:22,467
groups, and that was great. Um,
that was like, oh cool. By

357
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,196
meeting all these friends and a
little tip for everyone, um,

358
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,717
meetups are a great way to find a
job. It's like you meet the

359
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:30,057
people who are going to be
interviewing you beforehand. You

360
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:33,356
can figure out if they're like
nice people or not. So I highly

361
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:37,507
recommend that. Yeah. that was
kind of like what I did. And then

362
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,936
eventually, like, as I was
waiting for you, the stagnation

363
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:43,926
feeling, I came out the other
side and then I was like, Okay. I

364
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,656
don't feel stagnant anymore. I'm
being challenged. I'm surrounded

365
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:52,596
by really smart people. And I
felt like I've really, really was

366
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,356
going, but I was back on track
where I want it to be like, when

367
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:58,477
I kind of compared myself to my
friends, I was like, cool. We

368
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,277
were all kind of back on the same
level. Now I managed to very

369
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:05,076
quickly level myself up and.
That, that was a great feeling.

370
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,186
And it kinda made me think about
like how your career is kind of

371
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:13,116
like a garden as well. Um, who it
will be. This metaphor works

372
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:18,307
where if you kind of like, forget
about your garden and let it grow

373
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:22,626
wild. It's going to not be a
great garden and you've got to

374
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:26,737
sit there and maintain it. And so
you can, you know, plow the pow

375
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,646
pow, the grass, put it in, but
you also have to like, let it

376
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,557
grow as well organically like,
you can't sit there, poking the

377
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,416
seeds because the seeds will
never grow. You've got to like

378
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:37,807
water it and maybe brush the
soil. I don't know much about

379
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,007
gardening. Is that really?

380
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,362
Bekah: Yeah, that's a British
method that I am not aware of.

381
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:46,122
Dan: Sure, sure. Yeah.

382
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:46,576
Mike: maybe.

383
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,586
Dan: Get the soil brush out.

384
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,586
Mike: Yeah. That's this, put it
down as a British thing.

385
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,521
Dan: Well, it's it's that's
what's the point of the gardening

386
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:58,011
pick? You pick that up and none
of Japan, right? I'm pretty sure

387
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,531
that's the Japanese soil brush.
Yeah.

388
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,856
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You have
to, you have to be in your

389
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,797
bathroom. I said, well, you're
doing stuff. It's like, it's a

390
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:06,366
relaxing thing.

391
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,686
Bekah: They do in the bathroom.

392
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,281
Dan: that's a different,
different brush. Um, I, my guy, I

393
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:17,652
love this metaphor. I, uh, I was,
um, I was just thinking about

394
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,811
what you're talking, you know,
and, and yet, and there's a lot

395
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,221
of different, there's a lot of
different things you can do with

396
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,021
a garden. Right. And there's a
lot of different things you can

397
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:27,071
do, um, with your career, you
know, you could plant a bunch of

398
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,172
different things and kind of tend
them all.

399
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:30,537
Mike: Yeah.

400
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,842
Dan: maybe like, w were you doing
before? Like as a freelancer or

401
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:33,382
something, right,

402
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:37,196
Mike: Yeah. Or you could focus on
like certain individual things.

403
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,997
So you feel like, you know what
carrots, that's going to be. My

404
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:42,267
thing for this month, you can
agree on carrots. Or if you want

405
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:43,946
to have a big tree, which is
going to take a long time to

406
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,346
grow, where you put the seeds in
and you look after it, maybe you

407
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:51,086
put some like steaks in to help
it grow straight and strong. And

408
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:54,567
that's a lot like a career in a
way. And also sometimes you just

409
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,477
need to have people to help you
with things like doing stuff on

410
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:01,297
your own is hard. Like. It's so
much easier to have help from

411
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,027
other people, especially if
you're doing something big or

412
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:07,656
heavy, or even just asking people
like, Hey, how, how far apart

413
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:12,876
should I plant these like
carrots? It's like, yeah, I don't

414
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,136
know how far apart you should put
carrots. But when I have grown

415
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,926
carrots, I put them too close
together and they ended up

416
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:17,616
bunching together.

417
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,902
Bekah: Oh, yeah. There's lots of
things like that. And even like,

418
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:26,041
if you think about weeding and
how that applies to sometimes we

419
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,221
pick up bad habits. Right.

420
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:28,432
Mike: Oh, yes

421
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,922
Bekah: we do need some help, like
taking care of that part of it or

422
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:36,332
recognizing that like, oh wait,
that that's not a tomato plant.

423
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,892
That's this weed that looks
similar to a tomato plant, which

424
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,567
I have in my garden right now.
Right. I've got an app to

425
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:48,096
identify these things now. So
see, I found help. Um, and, and

426
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,186
this applies to, at so many
different stages of the career

427
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:54,967
too. I love it. Like this idea of
it can be so hard to be patient

428
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,166
when you are learning something
new, but that idea, like, look,

429
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:03,412
it doesn't, these things don't
grow overnight. Put tomato plants

430
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:07,041
in, in June. And I don't have
tomatoes that are red yet. It

431
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:11,511
just takes a while and you have
to give it nutrients. You have to

432
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:15,981
feed it. And, and then that's
when you collect the, you know,

433
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,332
the things that you've worked so
hard for.

434
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:24,307
Mike: Yeah. the super nice ones.
That's super good. Yeah. Um, so I

435
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,557
had something in there and then
it is wished completely out my

436
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:28,176
brain. It's like, there's no
thought.

437
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:30,426
Dan: I was going too far in the
metaphor. I was trying to figure

438
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,767
out how to keep, you know, how do
you keep chipmunks and squirrels

439
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:36,156
out of your career and kind of, I
don't think I've, I haven't, I

440
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:36,606
haven't found that.

441
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:41,346
Mike: I have one good thought
though, it's like, I'm getting

442
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,537
rid of those bad habits as well.
Cause that's the other thing,

443
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:46,626
which is, I feel keeps so many
people back is like they develop

444
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:51,517
all these bad things. Problems in
their, like how they approach

445
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:56,497
problems or like other aspects.
So a good example is let's say

446
00:24:56,497 --> 00:25:00,186
you have a developer who's very
bad at writing commit messages or

447
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:03,817
doing pull requests. And if you
were to work with them, that

448
00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:06,037
would probably rub off on you.
And then if you went to another

449
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,317
company, they might look at that
when they're interviewing you and

450
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:11,406
be like, no, you're bad at this
one particular thing we really

451
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:15,217
care about. And I found the best
thing to do is like constantly.

452
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:20,136
Almost work in public, as much as
you can and ask for constant

453
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:23,076
feedback or say, I've got this
like little hot tip for anyone

454
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:26,527
who's kind of senior. Um, and is
kind of in that. position where

455
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,227
they're like, have I picked up
bad habits, pay with junior devs?

456
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:33,936
They're like, they're fresh out
of like, uh, like the cancel that

457
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:36,547
causes. You can teach them a lot,
but also you can see what they're

458
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:39,696
doing differently to you. And
I've been pairing with my junior.

459
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,076
Uh, they're not a junior
developer, they're just a

460
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,717
developer, but, um, they call
themselves junior and I'm like,

461
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:46,747
don't call yourself junior. I
digress. Okay. So I've been

462
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:51,606
pairing with one of my colleagues
and they're fantastic, and they

463
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:54,517
do things a bit differently to
me. And I don't want to tell them

464
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:57,277
that. I think they're actually
doing it a bit better. Sometimes,

465
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:02,317
um, quietly changing a lot of my
habits now because they've

466
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,896
obviously found a more efficient
way because they just entered the

467
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,666
industry at a different time
where like all these extra things

468
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,576
I do aren't required anymore.
Like I've just picked up

469
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:15,846
something from somewhere where
it's like maybe using get version

470
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:20,511
control where it's like, the way
I change my branch is. The worst

471
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:23,092
way possible or how I emerged
that there's like an easy way now

472
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:26,541
there's like, and I'm just
completely wishing on it, um, the

473
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,832
whole time. Um, so Yeah, that's,
that's been one of those little

474
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:33,321
hot tips, which is like
completely changed and I highly

475
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:35,481
recommend it's pairing with
anyone and anyone who will help

476
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:35,662
you

477
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:39,116
Dan: I think that's great. I
think it's great advice. I wanted

478
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:42,817
to call out real quick. Your
piece of advice, right before

479
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:45,846
that, which was, you know,
working in public, uh, as ways to

480
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,396
improve your, you know, your own
skills or whatever your habits,

481
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:53,166
every, all of that. Um, I think
that's huge. And if you, um, I

482
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,926
find myself lots of times I'm
writing code that I know I'm only

483
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:59,136
going to see probably, or, you
know, most likely I'm the only

484
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,237
one that's ever going to look at
it lots of times. And I'll find

485
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:05,842
myself doing that, that same
thing kind of maybe, um, Not

486
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:08,902
explaining things as well, or
whatever, making commit messages

487
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,721
that don't actually say anything
or all of that writing, writing

488
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:14,602
issues that are just one line
instead of explaining the actual

489
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,082
process. And as soon as I find
myself working where I know

490
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:21,862
there's going to be other people,
whether it's work work or where I

491
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:26,061
know there's going to be a couple
of people or open-source stuff,

492
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:29,392
public stuff where I know like
possibly everybody could see it,

493
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:34,747
you know, Uh, almost forces you
to do it well, you know? Um, and

494
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:37,626
if you do it enough, it becomes
like you were saying, I have it,

495
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:41,326
you know, as opposed to, um, but
it kind of feels like pain. And I

496
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:44,467
find myself personally doing that
more, even with my own stuff,

497
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:47,106
just because it's like, oh, this
is just how I do write an issue

498
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:47,527
now, you know?

499
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,636
Mike: You have that feeling. I'm
going to be sitting behind you,

500
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,666
reading it back to you in a
snarky voice. Right? That's

501
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:57,207
that's what I do for everything
online. Now, every tweet I read,

502
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:59,547
it's like I do in my snarky
voice. Every time I write when

503
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:02,906
it's in my snarky voice. And it's
like, ah, this bug's broken. I

504
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,067
can hint how you reproduce it.
It's like good. Right. There's

505
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,886
all these steps and as soon as
the snarky voice disappears, it's

506
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:12,936
like, right. It's a, it's a good,
a good. issue a good pull request

507
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:19,251
Dan: that's amazing. That's
amazing. Yeah. Somebody, um, A

508
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:22,912
Virtual Coffee a while ago.
Actually, I think it started on

509
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,882
the podcast, but, um, somebody,
one of the random questions was,

510
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:28,402
you know, who would you want to
have narrating your life or your

511
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:31,882
inner monologue or something like
that. And, um, somebody mentioned

512
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,422
Alan Rickman and then I couldn't
just like, for the rest of the

513
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,561
day I had Snape like professor
Snape hanging over my head doing

514
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:42,112
the exact same thing, except in
like his like sarcastic, you

515
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:47,991
know, slow like, oh, does can't
reproduce the bug, Potter. Like

516
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,971
just like the sneering, you know,
at my like bad commit messages

517
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:56,271
Mike: that's one I want Nikki T
to be like the guy Who narrates

518
00:28:56,271 --> 00:29:00,051
my life, because, so I've got
such like a, like a dev crush on

519
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,271
him where it's like, when he
starts like working in public,

520
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:05,182
it's like, I want to do that.
That's what I want to do. Like

521
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:06,672
his confidence there is
incredible.

522
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:08,051
Dan: Yeah.

523
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:10,902
Mike: You've got me wanting to do
an Alan Rickman impression. Okay.

524
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:11,521
Bekah: Okay. Do

525
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:11,682
Mike: it.

526
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:13,281
Dan: yes, we need it.

527
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:20,592
Mike: Ah, on the spot! Good work,
Potter. Shoot the glass. I don't

528
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,092
think that's very good. Yeah.

529
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:30,652
Dan: Yeah. Oh man. He's the best.
Yeah. That the idea though, of

530
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:34,991
just putting it in public, you
know, even if it's, um, it

531
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:39,382
doesn't seem like. Yeah. I don't
know. It doesn't like, not meant

532
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:42,592
for an audience, you know, you're
not like, uh, performing or

533
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:45,412
whatever. Uh, I think I still
think it just helps so much. I

534
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:46,791
think that's great. Great advice.

535
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,031
Mike: Yeah. And honestly all it's
the little things as well,

536
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,701
because if you're thinking this
is in the public, now you're not

537
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,011
going to do like the little silly
mistakes, like accidentally

538
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,642
committing SSH keys or something,
or APA keys to version control.

539
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:03,021
And then in a few months later,
um, when you decide, I don't want

540
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:05,211
to do this project anymore, or
even open source of the project.

541
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,862
You don't find it. You go, oh no,
I have to nuke all the history.

542
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:09,362
Um,

543
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:10,271
Dan: Right. right,

544
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:13,402
Mike: in case, um, if you look at
it, I've got two projects by the

545
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:15,741
way, where I nuked the history,
because I did exactly that. And I

546
00:30:15,741 --> 00:30:19,162
really regretted that afterwards.
It was like, it was like two

547
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:22,192
years of like get version control
history. And I was like, I just,

548
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:26,182
just nuked them. Cause I couldn't
remember what was in there, but I

549
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,561
wish I had done something a bit
better.

550
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:31,392
Dan: Yeah, who knows? There's
probably ways to handle that, but

551
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:34,241
yeah, like, yeah, having that
plan in the back of your head,

552
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,731
maybe this eventually open
source. Yeah. I think, I think

553
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:39,761
helps helps your instincts kind
of cover that sort of thing.

554
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,602
Yeah, for sure.

555
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,757
Mike: so that one day will say,
like I was working on a project

556
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:47,807
and my friend texted me, um, my
friend Tom Familia. And he said,

557
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,626
by the way, you're on the front
page of Reddit. And it was on the

558
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:54,922
front page of like one of the
small. Four bucks a subreddit. So

559
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:57,741
it wasn't like front front page,
but someone had just found my

560
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,231
code base and was just sharing it
and talking about it. And I was

561
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,501
like, this is wild. It was only,
I think only like 25 people

562
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,231
actually looked at it. Like maybe
write some comments, but it was

563
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:10,182
like overall, everyone was really
polite and nice. And I was like,

564
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,582
I didn't expect that at all. I
always assume people on the

565
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,291
internet, they're going to be
terrible people, but

566
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:18,731
overwhelmingly, most people are
very nice and I just very happy

567
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,991
to see how other people work. I'm
very happy to see something

568
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:22,311
shared.

569
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,679
Bekah: I'm, I'm going to back up
a little bit, because I just

570
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,683
wanted to highlight this point
that you see. Um, I've, I've just

571
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:34,344
found that there are so many
people who have been developers

572
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:39,624
for a while who are also failing
like this stagnation that I think

573
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:44,003
kind of can lead to burnout. And,
and you, you know, you even said

574
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,963
like, Uh, this mean that I leave
tech, should I try something

575
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,864
else? And you said, you know, it
was, um, the morning that you

576
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,713
woke up and you're like, dreaded,
hit hitting the power button.

577
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:59,044
Right. Like you just felt this
dread. And I think that it's, I

578
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,794
just want to highlight that
because I think that not enough

579
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,334
people recognize like, okay, this
is, this is a bad point. Like

580
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:10,973
this is time to evaluate some
things and change some ways. So

581
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:14,963
do you think. No. How do you
think that you, can you prevent

582
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:19,284
that from happening? Um, or if
you could go back and do things

583
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:22,794
differently, is there something
that you would do to avoid that

584
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:23,334
stagnation?

585
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:30,169
Mike: Oh, it's, it's a difficult
question. Um, so when I entered

586
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:34,729
Ruby, there were two really
prominent Rubyists. So Ryan B and

587
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:42,189
_why. And they are two developers
who kind of very famously left

588
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:45,038
one day and never came back. And
for one of them, we were like, is

589
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,249
he Okay. What's happened to this
guy. And I want to say there was

590
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:50,709
an article in the New York times
saying, like what happened to

591
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:54,159
this person who was like
everywhere? And then one day just

592
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,858
disappeared. And I think they
turned out to be a manager at

593
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:00,449
Walmart in the end. And like
someone like track them down, but

594
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:03,538
for private investigator and that
always sat in the back of my head

595
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,489
going Okay. Um, so people do
leave every now and again and

596
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:10,479
just decide they want to get away
from whatever life they've just

597
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:17,378
created, because it's just not
doing it for them. And things I

598
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:22,419
would do definitely is I wish I
had a bigger support network of

599
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:26,949
like dev people. Um, back when I
was, when I was like really peak,

600
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:31,733
unhappy, I didn't have anyone to
talk to. Like I had like maybe

601
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:35,273
five other developers I knew, and
I wasn't that close with them.

602
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:41,304
And I just wish I could have had
someone to be like, Hey, I'm

603
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:46,913
feeling this. Has anyone else
felt this? What did they do? And

604
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,814
that wasn't, it's not that it
wasn't a thing. It's just, I

605
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:54,354
hadn't found it yet. So I almost
want to like encourage everyone

606
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:57,713
to. Grow that professional
network, you know, that, that

607
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:00,203
little fish in the garden of the
professional network of people

608
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:04,844
here, like be like this, there
fee to answer some questions. And

609
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,423
if you send them a private
message, there'll be like

610
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,364
sympathetic to be like, Okay.
cool. Now I can, I can help you

611
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,914
with this. And if you want to
jump on a call, so we'll go out

612
00:34:12,914 --> 00:34:17,414
for coffee, then that's, that's
something that we'll do. And I

613
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:20,054
think it's easier now. Like
thanks to the global pandemic.

614
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,543
There's like plays a nice slack
groups and you can pick out your

615
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,523
individual people. You're ready.
You know, make part of your,

616
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,224
like, you know, inner circle of
like people you already trust.

617
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,443
Have you guys heard about the
thing where you only have like a

618
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,313
hundred and full, proper close
friends? Like that theory? Um,

619
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:38,469
Dan: Yeah, I vaguely, I
definitely am familiar with, you

620
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:38,918
know, what you're

621
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:42,384
Mike: Yeah. Like it's some kind
of human thing where you can only

622
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:46,014
keep track of so many people
properly. And so if you've only

623
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:48,114
got like a hundred friends, some
of them are going to be family.

624
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:51,224
Some of them that'd be like old
school friends maybe. And I think

625
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:54,884
you should probably pick like a
few key developers or people in

626
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,273
your field who you really like,
and let's keep them in that light

627
00:34:58,273 --> 00:35:02,893
we'll circle of a hundred people
who could sit in your phone book

628
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:03,403
or something.

629
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:10,391
Dan: I think that's great. I, uh,
having somebody who. Is in

630
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,791
whatever field you're in, you
know, and can understand a lot of

631
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,851
the context that goes around. I,
you know, a close friend from,

632
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:19,121
from when you were young, even
somebody who you keep in touch

633
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:21,972
with, uh, but isn't it a complete
different field. Um, when always

634
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:25,782
have the context, you know,
somebody that might be like,

635
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,851
well, you just, you have a good
job that pays well, why are you

636
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:30,731
unhappy? You know, something like
that. But I think that your, your

637
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:35,202
story is going to ring true with
a lot of developers. Um, you

638
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:39,717
know, the, the, this, the, that
feeling of. Satisfaction.

639
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,541
Mike: there's pinpointed the
exact phrase, which made me never

640
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,242
want to talk out about being
unhappy and tech as well, because

641
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:49,112
we're a really well compensated
field. Like you tell people that

642
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,891
you own, like, this is how much
money you earn. Like starting.

643
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:56,972
Most people are like, oh, I just
want to do that job. And very few

644
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:59,936
people maybe talk about, oh,
actually, There's a very unhappy

645
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:02,186
side to this where you are
sitting inside all day, typing at

646
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,766
a keyboard or planning out a
database and it could all go

647
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:09,867
horribly wrong. And that feeling
is like, well, you could, yeah.

648
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:14,306
That tiny mistake, you know, is
there could just balloon into a

649
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,577
monster. And if you don't deal
with it, it's going to be

650
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:20,996
embarrassing. And people will
almost look at your work and your

651
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:23,396
work always has your name next to
it as well. That's something

652
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:24,686
we've done as an industry.

653
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:25,681
Dan: Forever.

654
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:28,947
Mike: away from this. Yeah. Like
I've picked up code and I went,

655
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:31,856
who wrote this? And then I'm
like, oh, it's that guy. Okay. He

656
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:36,567
pops up everywhere and it's like,
oh, that's an interesting one. Or

657
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,416
it's like, oh wait, no, it was
me. I'm the bad guy in, in my

658
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:43,257
story. Uh, Yeah. And it's, it's
difficult to talk to people about

659
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:48,567
this cause it's, we're in a
different world and this is why I

660
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,447
really like having a few really
close developer friends who are

661
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:54,266
like, we're all kind of in the
same bubble. We know like how,

662
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,777
how it goes in terms of, Okay.
Yeah. You do have days where you

663
00:36:57,777 --> 00:37:01,106
are just sitting at a computer
screen, looking at a black

664
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:05,172
terminal. And you'll just say, I
can't figure this out. I have.

665
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:09,431
And you Google the question and
like one guy, one person on stack

666
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:14,021
overflow has asked to, and it's
like no answers. And it's like,

667
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,702
uh, how obscure is this? What am
I doing wrong? Sorry.

668
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:20,862
Bekah: Or I feel like the worst
is when you get that, but then

669
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:23,112
they respond to their posts and
they're like, I got it.

670
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:25,751
Nevermind. I'm like, well, can

671
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:31,032
Mike: Should I be what you did,
what did you do to solve it? Uh,

672
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:33,731
but has anyone come back and
found their old posts from when

673
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:37,001
they Regina to go correct them or
add more information, but we're

674
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:37,452
just me.

675
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,871
Bekah: There's no way I would
ever do That

676
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:42,181
Mike: Aye. Aye.

677
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:44,641
Bekah: of where I was at that
point in my life. And I'm going

678
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,411
to just go with that.

679
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,251
Mike: I changed my username
online at some point, just to not

680
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:55,322
fight any someone, a VC found my
OGs name, um, because I'd written

681
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,961
a comment like being like nice.
And they're like, wait, hold on.

682
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:02,222
This is the same writing style as
that person. And that name is

683
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:07,572
very familiar and they figured
out it was me from like, Well,

684
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,331
yeah, two years ago solving That
problem and they sent me a thank

685
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,731
you. And I'm like, I need to go
back and work for more of these

686
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:17,472
places. Now it's the, we've got
some good detectives in the crowd

687
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,762
who he know my old user name.

688
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:24,972
Dan: That that's pretty funny. I,
I, um, yeah, going back and

689
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,762
that's an interesting idea of
just going back and updating,

690
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:31,572
answering your own questions, you
know, uh, back in the day, this

691
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:34,422
is what I did. I promise. I
wouldn't probably remember, you

692
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:35,501
know, any of the answers

693
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,726
Mike: Yeah, but you might be able
to figure it out, like go back

694
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,637
and be like, this is prob this is
what I was asking. I think I

695
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:46,126
vaguely remember. What that
question could be, or at least

696
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:49,277
you can put it in the right place
or maybe archive the question if

697
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:52,117
you were like, no, this is
garbage. I need to hide this from

698
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:56,527
the world or something like that,
but it gets, it comes back to the

699
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,777
garden again. It's like, you
know, putting up the bits in the

700
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:02,646
back, which you don't often tend
to, or like getting rid of the

701
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:05,407
bad information. Maybe if you put
out some old comments,

702
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:10,492
Dan: Right or change your use
name? Maybe just throw a tarp

703
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:12,061
Mike: no, they'll, they'll
protest

704
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:12,652
Dan: somewhere else.

705
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:15,601
Mike: every few years to start a
fresh this,

706
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:18,561
Dan: Right? Buy a new plot of
land.

707
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,041
Mike: yeah, I'm going to be Mike
Rodriguez. I think it's the it's

708
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:27,061
completely changed. My name grow
miss big, big bushy mustache,

709
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,652
like shave my mustache.

710
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:36,298
Dan: So you. Um, I, I found it
really cool and impressive, uh,

711
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,048
your process for when you sorry
we keep we keep going back to

712
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:44,219
that moment, but at that moment,
um, where you made that list, um,

713
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,039
and, you know, found some stuff
that worked for you that wasn't

714
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,639
like, That wasn't like, I know
you started applying for jobs and

715
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,248
stuff too, but the list of side
things like side projects or, or

716
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:57,119
other things like that. Um, and
so I guess my question with that

717
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,338
was, um, do, now that you were
in, um, maybe a more stable

718
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:05,398
situation, you know, how have you
found yourself? And I think the

719
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:07,438
answer is yes, but like, have you
found yourself keeping up with

720
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,829
those things that you did mostly
to get yourself moving again? You

721
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,528
know, and, um, and I was
wondering if you could talk a

722
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:14,338
little bit about that.

723
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,199
Mike: absolutely. So this is, I
guess the other part of this,

724
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:20,684
where. When you're searching for
a job or trying to make a big

725
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:23,503
change, it's really easy to like
go out, like again, back to the

726
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:25,963
garden. Like, you know, when you
want to make it pretty, it's

727
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,824
like, it's easy to put the effort
in for a few weeks and then

728
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:30,043
you've got a pretty garden, but
actually you need to maintain it

729
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,893
over a long period of time and
you can't go in with like

730
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:36,583
absolute, full force, full time
to make that garden pretty. You

731
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,873
have to do like come up with a
reason. So I've, I mean, I'm

732
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:44,713
still really bad at keeping up to
date with like keeping things

733
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:48,373
going out. But what I do is I set
myself a goal of like one post a

734
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:53,023
month, one video a month. So,
which I think is very achievable.

735
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:58,304
It's not, not too much work. It's
a very steady flow. And I just

736
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:00,704
say, right, that's what I'm going
to aim for. It's I'm going to

737
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:04,574
keep putting things out and
that's going to be what I do

738
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:09,014
like, and I've managed to do that
pretty well. So. And even if it's

739
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:13,634
not like a really well thought
out thing, like if I've got

740
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:16,393
something on my mind, I just want
to write about it, or I want to

741
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,673
make a video on something. Cause
I know I've seen people

742
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:22,693
struggling. It will happen. And
then also on the lists as well, I

743
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:26,833
am the worst and the best. And
the greatest. There you go. I'm

744
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,804
the greatest for making lists,
sorry. I'm not the worst. I'm the

745
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:33,534
best. Sorry. Completely wrong
time. I love making lists. Lists

746
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:36,693
are like I've got, I use the
Reminders app in apple where you

747
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:40,563
can have lots of little lists
broken out to categories. And I

748
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:43,903
have, I always go through them.
Curate them as well. So at the

749
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:46,423
end of the month, I remove stuff,
which actually I'm not that

750
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,523
interested in doing anymore. And
then throughout the month they

751
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:52,304
keep adding stuff in. So I've got
a big list of blog posts. I want

752
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:55,454
to write. I've got the titles
done and I've got like a link to

753
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:58,514
where I think I could take them.
Same with videos. Same with like

754
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:02,833
little things I need to do. Um,
And that has that's helped a lot.

755
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,353
I, I realized I'm a very list
oriented person. Like I think

756
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:08,534
it's agile methodologies have
like ruined me. I was like

757
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:11,653
working in like, you know, having
a startup every morning. I almost

758
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,623
like if I had a pet cat, me and
the cat would have a start up

759
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:17,233
every morning about what we're
going to achieve that day. And

760
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:21,583
I'll do the voice of the cat,
obviously. Um, you guys won't

761
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,804
know the accent. I give it, but
every day it would be slightly

762
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:27,373
different. Like I'm just
imagining that the cat is snarky.

763
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:31,079
Uh, you can, you're gonna write a
blog post. You did that nice one.

764
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:36,364
Bekah: I would like a whole
series of that.

765
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:40,304
Dan: Yeah. That's uh, the new,
the new Mike Rogers video series

766
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:43,213
is conversations with the cat. We
just need to, we just need to get

767
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:44,204
you a cat first and then

768
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,818
Mike: It could happen soon
enough. That's there's some

769
00:42:46,818 --> 00:42:48,949
floating around outside. Maybe
others feed some.

770
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,364
Dan: yeah. I mean, that's true.
Cats'll, cats'll learning. If you

771
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,753
start feeding them, they'll
they'll learn my, um, Emily's my

772
00:42:55,753 --> 00:43:00,778
wife's grandma. Uh, feeds cats in
our yard to cause they killed the

773
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,318
chipmunks and squirrels, you
know, it's because she wants them

774
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,768
to come, but they'll come like
they'll, they'll learn here.

775
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:06,918
They'll learn your routine and
stuff. So he could just have a

776
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:09,509
little stand up with the cat
under stoop, you know, every,

777
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:13,039
every morning I would watch that.

778
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,869
Mike: I, yeah, I think we just
hit my new video series. Right.

779
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,228
It's like, this is what we're
going to do today. Cut. Like,

780
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:21,869
almost like, was it pinky in the
brain? What are you going to do

781
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,139
today? Pinky or brain. Oh, I'm
going to take over the world.

782
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,369
Yeah.

783
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,893
Bekah: but by Joe. So, you know,
one of the things like talking

784
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:36,403
through all of them, Has been
really fascinating. And I'm like

785
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,853
amazed by how many people that
I've talked to that have talked

786
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:44,164
about how much they love their
job. And then suddenly realized

787
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,454
that they hate their job. Like.

788
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:49,623
Mike: I'm suspicious of people
who say they love, love their job

789
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:52,474
on the site. I don't think you
do. I think you're just saying

790
00:43:52,474 --> 00:43:52,804
that,

791
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,329
Bekah: I think it's a lot of
times like putting your hand in

792
00:43:57,329 --> 00:43:59,969
warm water and then slowly
boiling boiling it or frog, I

793
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:00,449
guess you don't

794
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:01,889
Mike: Yeah. That's I know the

795
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:02,938
Bekah: it with a frog either, but

796
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:05,259
Mike: Yeah.

797
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:09,664
Bekah: You increase it, the
temperature and don't realize it

798
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:15,543
because it's just like this slow,
um, process until like suddenly

799
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,063
you're boiling. And then I think
at that point you're like, oh,

800
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:22,184
Maybe, maybe I don't love this.
Maybe I did love this at one

801
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:26,474
point, but all of these things
are keep changing and I just

802
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:30,793
missed it or kept thinking that
it will get better and it just

803
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,634
keeps getting worse, you know?
And then we don't talk about that

804
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:37,244
kind of stuff enough. And I think
part of it, like you said, we

805
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:41,083
make a lot of money in tech and
you can make a lot of money and

806
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,414
not be happy. It's okay. To not
love to code, but there's a

807
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:50,333
difference between not loving to
code and really being unhappy

808
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,884
because it bleeds out into all
the other aspects of your life.

809
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:58,478
Mike: Exactly. Like if, Yeah. I
feel like unhappy at work and you

810
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,809
can't quite identify, like what's
what the cause is. Or like you're

811
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,438
unhappy outside of work and
you've got to bring it in. Like

812
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:07,028
it just kind of, it slows you
down in the other places and

813
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:10,963
you've got to like really. Find
the good bits. And this is why

814
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:13,634
I'm also suspicious of people who
say they've really loved their

815
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:17,353
job. Um, sorry. I'm like, like
mumbling next to it. So I'm like,

816
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,784
we aren't allowed to say we don't
like our job. It's none of that.

817
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:23,523
It's like, no, she don't tell
people. You hate certain things

818
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:26,284
about work. It's never going to
change. You've got to like,

819
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,063
you've got to almost go out to
your manager or be the, be the

820
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:35,278
change you want to see in the
office. So if you want to. Do

821
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,498
certain processes to stop doing
them and then see if anyone will

822
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:42,748
fight you on like, not doing them
and to see what happens like

823
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:45,748
worst case scenario. You have a
fun argument with someone and

824
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:49,079
you'll be able to find out the
benefits of something or maybe

825
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,009
not right.

826
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,914
Dan: I love it. I, this actually
that goes right into a question I

827
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:56,373
was going to ask was, um, you
mentioned when you were talking

828
00:45:56,373 --> 00:46:01,514
about, um, So your freelancing
experience, you know, before, and

829
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:05,353
it's sort of, you said it as an
aside, but you said he sometimes

830
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:07,963
have problems with authority and,
you know, it had been one of the

831
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:11,594
reasons why you had stuck with
the freelancing for so long. And,

832
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:14,414
um, I was, my question was
basically just like I was

833
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,813
wondering you now we're working
for sort of a larger

834
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:20,554
organization. I was just
wondering, um, how that is. You

835
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:23,134
know, vis-a-vis like authority
and having bosses and, and

836
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:25,534
probably different tiers of
managers, but I'm not really

837
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:28,204
sure, but you know, that sort of
thing. I was wondering if, uh, if

838
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:28,434
that has

839
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:28,893
Mike: It's so

840
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:29,643
Dan: any effect on you.

841
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:34,094
Mike: It's so different. I find
it almost comical every time I

842
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:38,623
have to like fill out some kind
of form and I always make sure,

843
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:43,273
like, I tell people that this is
a stupid form or like, Hey, this

844
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:46,423
is a waste of time. Like we've
just spent like three hours

845
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:51,059
planning for something like.
Yeah, well, it surprises me. So

846
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,978
the companies you have meetings
about when you're going to have a

847
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:57,028
meeting about something more
frequently than you expect, like,

848
00:46:57,268 --> 00:46:59,579
I feel like when I was a
freelancer, that was like, they

849
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,009
would never bring a freelancer
into that kind of eating that is

850
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:03,958
like, this is what we're going to
get the freelancer to do. Cool.

851
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,389
All right. We'll just give them
the work or give them the work

852
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:12,048
even. Um, yeah, I'm still. Still
terrible with authority figures

853
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,239
where it's like someone tells me
to do something and I'm just

854
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,869
like, come on, you're going to do
it. If I want to do it, that,

855
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,969
manage that to figure out how
you're going to motivate me to do

856
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:20,568
this

857
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,364
Dan: I love that. I I, I,

858
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,039
Mike: send money.

859
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:35,284
Dan: yeah, I've been a
freelancer, you know, my whole

860
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:39,764
career and that's that. Um, one
of the reasons why I've almost

861
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:41,653
never really, I mean, there's
only been a couple of times where

862
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:45,733
I've really considered, you know,
switching, uh, to say some sort

863
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:49,684
of full-time job that the, um, I
think about the meetings and

864
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:52,123
especially if being a freelance
or not being in those meetings is

865
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:55,634
actually like, can be really
frustrating too. Um, I found, you

866
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:59,083
know, the, somebody just gives
you the work, but you don't have

867
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:02,773
any connection to. The inception
of the work, you know, or like

868
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,864
probably you might actually have
a better idea then there's, you

869
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:10,543
know, uh, I feel like that's
maybe a, a pro for getting more

870
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:13,483
involved in a, in a company, you
know, at, at a high level kind of

871
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:13,753
thing.

872
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:18,219
Mike: Yeah. I think I've
definitely had work come in

873
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,679
around. I'm like, why don't we
just do the simple way? And then

874
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:22,628
I reply back and then they're
like, oh, we didn't know about

875
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:25,088
that. I mean, this had like, we
just wasted hours planning this

876
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:27,699
workout for you. And it's like,
cool. So we'll just do the easy

877
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:31,148
way then. Nice cool and those
still get paid like the same

878
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:34,639
amount. Cause that was going to
take weeks. Um,

879
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,923
Bekah: Uh, it should be like a
bonus for those situations.

880
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,599
Mike: Uh, it's, that's not how
freelancing ever has worked.

881
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:45,583
Dan: Yeah, no, that's not. Yeah,
that's it. I mean, the bonus is

882
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,094
that they trust you more and they
keeping paying for your work. I

883
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:52,034
mean, that's, that's like, that's
the bonus, I suppose, as a

884
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:57,403
freelancer, you know? Um, but
also personally, Doing things

885
00:48:57,403 --> 00:49:01,273
that are stupid too. Like I've
never been, I've never been, I

886
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:03,463
know some people where, you know,
you get that same thing. You're

887
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:05,384
like, I know that there's an easy
way to do this. That would take

888
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:08,054
me an hour. And the way they've
asked me will take two weeks or

889
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:13,543
something, you know? And, uh, I
could just let it ride, you know,

890
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,034
but I would be miserable for
those two weeks, you know? And

891
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:18,373
I'm like, let's just do the easy
way. That'd be, that'd be fine.

892
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:18,733
That'd be

893
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,184
Mike: Yeah, this is, this is why
I always, I think this is also

894
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:25,034
one of the things which has made
me a happier person. I always

895
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:28,213
like kind of pushing back on
everything where I can, or at

896
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:31,443
least trying to be a bit yeah.
Like confrontational, because

897
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,324
other you're going to be doing
that miserable work all day. And

898
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:36,423
it's like, there's no point
during the miserable work. Cause

899
00:49:36,454 --> 00:49:39,213
like, it's just going to get
deleted the week after when

900
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:42,994
someone decides they want to do
it the easy way. And you just

901
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:45,873
kind of wasting your time and
your time is so precious. Like

902
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:50,009
I'm not sure. That anyone
listening to this, but like, I

903
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:53,278
I'm, I'm I feel young Right. now,
but I'm also scared that soon I'm

904
00:49:53,278 --> 00:49:56,998
going to wake up and be this like
crazy. Like my life's gone of

905
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:00,449
like the best years have passed
or something. And I don't want to

906
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:03,719
spend it like trying to solve
some stupid problem. Like when

907
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:06,869
there's an easy way to do it, I
to, I want to be out playing golf

908
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:09,748
or like doing something more
interesting.

909
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,259
Dan: Tending tending your garden,
right?

910
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,344
Mike: Tending to my garden. Yeah.
that was,

911
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,164
Bekah: Brushing his garden.

912
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:15,898
Dan: Brushing the soil.

913
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:21,003
Mike: but yeah. Thinking about
that now, I think I'm in raking

914
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:21,724
the soils.

915
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:22,034
Bekah: Yeah.

916
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:22,858
Dan: Yeah. That's that's

917
00:50:23,193 --> 00:50:24,184
Mike: that was a hundred percent.

918
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:24,748
Dan: That makes sense.

919
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:29,224
Mike: It took me 20 minutes to
figure That out. I'm glad we had

920
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:30,094
a meeting about that.

921
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:37,469
Dan: right? Yeah. Oh man. It's
amazing. I still do love that

922
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,878
metaphor though. I'm going to be
thinking about it.

923
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:43,778
Mike: I'm I feel like I want to
get like, like have you seen when

924
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:48,969
people have like live loss live
or life, so throw those out

925
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:51,909
because those are terrible, but
change it if like, you know,

926
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,648
garden your career or your career
is a garden and brush it.

927
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:07,469
Dan: Okay. Brush that dirt.

928
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:11,009
Bekah: I think we have a code of
conduct. Okay.

929
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:12,358
Dan: I

930
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:17,353
Mike: Like Icarus right now. It's
like 10.

931
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:22,048
Dan: Oh man. That's amazing.

932
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:23,248
Mike: Okay.

933
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:28,483
Dan: Yeah, I'm going to make that
sign for sure. I can't, every

934
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:30,498
Bekah: That's going to be a
sticker. We need

935
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:32,893
Dan: tell him, don't tell me,
don't tell me what to do. Sign.

936
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:41,458
Mike: My manager, but not, I
don't listen to you so like you

937
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:43,318
might manage it, but I'm ignoring
you because you're wrong.

938
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:45,088
Bekah: Okay.

939
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:49,034
Mike: in management. You're not a
developer. Sorry.

940
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:52,744
Bekah: hot takes.

941
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:53,713
Mike: Spicy.

942
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:57,253
Dan: Well, you, you had that lot.
What was it? Uh, oh, good luck.

943
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,244
Good luck managing me or

944
00:51:58,403 --> 00:51:58,523
Bekah: Okay.

945
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,204
Dan: good luck motivated me to do
that.

946
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:06,123
Mike: Yes. That is what I want on
my laptop.

947
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,989
Bekah: Like, I, I we're like
almost at time and I really want

948
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:15,148
to dive into that idea of
motivation a little bit more

949
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:18,449
because something that I've been
interested in, and you're talking

950
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:21,088
about this competition that you
have with your friend. And so,

951
00:52:21,088 --> 00:52:25,648
like, obviously that's a good
motivator, but I think, I, I

952
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:28,079
don't know if we have time to
talk about this. So maybe just

953
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,219
some, a

954
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:29,918
Mike: should've been so quick.

955
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:34,063
Bekah: On how to motivate people
and keep them from stagnation.

956
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:35,324
Right? Cause that's part of it.

957
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:39,929
Mike: Yeah. So I've got like one,
one quick tick and it's like, so

958
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:45,193
I have a podcast. I listen to
where. It's like a meditation

959
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:49,034
podcast and that has been so
wonderful. Um, I talk about it in

960
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:52,123
VC, quite a lot of things called
meditation minis. They're 10

961
00:52:52,123 --> 00:52:55,514
minutes. They come out like once
a week and they are just a

962
00:52:55,514 --> 00:53:01,443
wonderful way of just like before
bed. I sit down and I was very

963
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:04,143
skeptical when I first tried it,
but something about the sitting

964
00:53:04,143 --> 00:53:07,503
down, down and relaxing for 10
minutes before bed has helped me

965
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:11,309
enormously. I think there's
getting a better night's sleep

966
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,849
and having good sleep hygiene as
well. So I feel better, like I

967
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:17,369
don't work till like three in the
morning or four in the morning

968
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:22,068
and wake up at 7:00 AM and then
like rec my, uh, rec my sleep.

969
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:25,724
Which has been good. And I also
really recommend everyone. If

970
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,514
you're not feeling great, talk to
a therapist, it's like, it's

971
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:31,123
super easy. Now. There's like,
there's apps to do it. It's like,

972
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:35,083
you don't have to kind of go to a
place and tap them in person. You

973
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:38,143
could talk to someone this via
WhatsApp, and then they'll just

974
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:43,483
do the things and then you'll be,
you might feel better. Yeah. The

975
00:53:43,483 --> 00:53:46,634
reason. I also say therapist, as
well as when someone explained

976
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:48,704
the concept of therapy, I was
like, that sounds, that sounds

977
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:51,043
weird. But then they're like,
they said to me, okay, so your

978
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:53,864
parents, no one told them how to
raise you. They figured it out

979
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:59,083
and they screwed up everything
probably. So, so a therapist is

980
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,744
like, they iron out the bits,
your parents, like didn't like

981
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:05,713
give you the tools to like solve
in life. So like how to deal with

982
00:54:05,983 --> 00:54:09,643
like, being really unhappy or
they'll give you some techniques

983
00:54:09,643 --> 00:54:11,704
to deal with it. Or if you're
feeling anxious, they.

984
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:15,239
Approaches, which no one tells
you about until you pay them the

985
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:18,119
money. And it's like a hundred
bucks and they'll pay, Okay. Here

986
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:21,509
is the secret to like getting rid
of anxiety. If you're feeling

987
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:25,199
anxious about something. And then
also, Yeah. a bit of healthy

988
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:28,829
competition. Like I always, I
love to show off and like, I love

989
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:32,068
to be competitive with my
friends. So like we always send

990
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,858
each other what we're up to and
try and get feedback. And

991
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,438
sometimes we are brutally honest
with each other saying, this is a

992
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:40,588
terrible idea. You're going to
waste all your money here. And

993
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:42,298
then other times it's like,
they're like, no, this is an

994
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:46,949
interesting idea. You should, you
should give it a go. Um, a really

995
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,458
good example of me being
completely wrong. Um, one of my

996
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,639
friends showed me this app ID had
where it was people watching

997
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:57,688
YouTube videos together, and this
was pre pandemic. And, you know,

998
00:54:57,688 --> 00:54:59,909
being able to write notes around
them and then have a bit of a

999
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:02,278
conversation afterwards. And I
was like, That's. a stupid idea.

1000
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:03,298
That'll never take off.

1001
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:03,579
Bekah: Okay.

1002
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:08,039
Mike: Um, I found a app recently,
which had raised tons of money to

1003
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,548
do just that. And it was a really
good app. And I was like, we were

1004
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,458
watching, I think it was a Sandy
med store together with a bunch

1005
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,648
of other developers. And I was
like, this is perfect. This is

1006
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:19,469
what I like. And I really regret
not like encouraging my friend

1007
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,619
now because really regret it
because he couldn't get a

1008
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,759
millionaire. I think.

1009
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:29,226
Dan: That's. Yeah, that's one of
those weird things that like the

1010
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:33,335
pandemic, I feel like, uh, it, it
doesn't sound like a good idea.

1011
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:35,496
It didn't sound like a good idea
to me either that, that sort of

1012
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:38,226
thing. Cause you know, and then,
well now we can't actually be in

1013
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:40,585
the same room together. So, so
like,

1014
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,050
Mike: perfect. I love it. I hate
being in the same room as people,

1015
00:55:43,396 --> 00:55:44,815
Dan: yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1016
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,871
Mike: No, I'm just kidding.

1017
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:48,545
Bekah: has been.

1018
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,681
Mike: Yeah. It's been fantastic

1019
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:55,295
Bekah: Really good podcast
episode. So thank you

1020
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,451
Mike: to wrap up before I talk
for another two hours and we

1021
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:03,851
ended up having some mega session
and it's like, the list is like,

1022
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,041
I think maybe we'll save like
another topic for another podcast

1023
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:15,306
season or something. I hope. Um,
yeah, if I could go out and like

1024
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:17,885
one final thing Is Yeah,
obviously we talked about, if

1025
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:21,606
you're feeling like stagnant in
your career, just talk, talk to

1026
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:24,516
people, even if it's a private
one, you will feel better for

1027
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:27,936
that. And we've all gone through
this. We all feel sad. So this

1028
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:31,085
just talk, it's tell people, ask
for help. You'll feel better for

1029
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:31,206
it.

1030
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:35,416
Bekah: absolutely. That's a
great, great piece of advice to

1031
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:35,715
end that.

1032
00:56:35,746 --> 00:56:39,335
Mike: my DMS are normally open,
so happy to chat to people.

1033
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,831
Bekah: All right. Thanks, Mike.
We'll talk to

1034
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,201
