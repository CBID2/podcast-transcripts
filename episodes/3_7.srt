00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:09,867
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode seven of

2
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:12,832
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast

3
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:15,797
that

4
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,669
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:20,989
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:22,309
their

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,978
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:26,403
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:27,828
it with

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,798
you. Here with me today, is my
cohost Dan.

11
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:35,442
Dan: Thanks Bekah! Today we're
joined by Mike Rogers. Mike is a

12
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,572
Ruby developer from the UK. And
if you're a Virtual Coffee

13
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,672
member

14
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:42,853
(and if you're not, you should
join), you've probably seen his

15
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,393
chatbots at work everyday in the
Virtual Coffee slack. Uh, which

16
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,268
we very much love and
appreciate. We had a really

17
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:50,143
great time

18
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,807
talking with Mike. Mike has had
a long and successful career.

19
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,471
But

20
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,232
at one point he realized he no
longer felt good or satisfied

21
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:57,927
with where he was as a
developer. He shared with us

22
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,622
what he did to

23
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:02,472
change course and how he has
learned to approach tending his

24
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:04,452
career. Almost like a garden.
Mike has a lot of insights and

25
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:06,432
we

26
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,033
had a blast talking to him. I
know you're going to enjoy it.

27
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:14,093
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

28
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:17,153
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

29
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:19,312
we're from, what we do in a
random check-in question.

30
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,471
Today's

31
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,737
question is you can have an
unlimited supply of one thing

32
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:26,002
for

33
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,533
the rest of your life, what is
it? We hope you enjoy this

34
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:41,968
episode. Hi, I'm Bekah. I'm a
front end developer from a small

35
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,713
town in Ohio. And if I could
have an unlimited supply of one

36
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,458
thing,

37
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,448
I'm, I'm going to say energy.
Cause I feel like there's not,

38
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,899
not like power for my lights,
but like for me personally,

39
00:01:57,103 --> 00:02:01,213
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan I'm a front
end developer from Cleveland,

40
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,513
Ohio, and yeah. Uh, rest was the
first thing that popped into my

41
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:09,743
head. Um, I, uh, you know, I
don't know. I was just telling

42
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,854
Bekah before we recorded, I had
my two year old woke up maybe

43
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:16,123
four or five times in the middle
of the night, last night. Um,

44
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:21,493
and, um, just to, I just don't
have time. I don't know how time

45
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,653
would work. Like that was my
going to be my other answer, but

46
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:27,579
like, that doesn't...super make
sense. I don't mean

47
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,253
Bekah: dangerous. You're messing
with the space time continuum.

48
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:30,463
And I

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,258
Dan: I'm all right with that
though. I'm all right. Being a

50
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,368
time variant, you know?

51
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:35,713
Bekah: wow.

52
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,109
Dan: Well, like it's like almost
like a Time Turner or something,

53
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,389
right. Or like that, the pause
time thing. We've, we've, we've

54
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,669
talked about that. I feel like
before it's, it's come up a few

55
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,329
times. Um, but yeah, so I'm, I'm
going to stick with the rest

56
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,723
though, you know, um, our
energy, I suppose it's almost

57
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,117
the same

58
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:49,929
thing, right?

59
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,514
Mike: Sounds like you kind of
this pitch red bull that if I'm

60
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:53,903
honest.

61
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,933
Dan: Yeah, well, that's right.
Yeah. It's a slippery slope

62
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:57,653
Bekah: what we want.

63
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:00,954
Dan: But I I'm, I'm going with
rest that's that's my official

64
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:01,044
name.

65
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,613
Mike: Okay. well, I'm Mike
Rogers I'm a Ruby developer

66
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,908
originally

67
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,549
from the United Kingdom. I
currently live in the United

68
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,058
States, which is quite exciting
if I had an unlimited supply of

69
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,008
something, I want to say
enthusiasm. Um, because

70
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,958
sometimes

71
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,419
I go through those little down
bits where I'm like, I can't be

72
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,179
bothered to code and I just wish
I could turn on something and be

73
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,364
like, no, now I really want to
code again. This is great. Or

74
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:24,549
get

75
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,563
something done. That'd be me.

76
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,498
Dan: I liked that I was almost
going to say, like, you're just

77
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,618
wishing for something that you
already have, but, uh, that,

78
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:32,738
that

79
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,318
explanation

80
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,933
Mike: I want more of the thing I
already have, please.

81
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:43,014
Bekah: Mike is one of the most
enthusiastic members of Virtual

82
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,363
Coffee. If you are ever in a
room with him and you are

83
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:45,712
feeling

84
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,138
down, I don't think it's
possible to leave that room

85
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:48,563
without

86
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,843
feeling happy. So I hope that
you get that from this episode

87
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,123
too.

88
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,473
Mike: Always throws me off when
people say that, because

89
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:56,807
everyone

90
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,038
says that and I'm like,
seriously, I'm just being

91
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,268
myself.

92
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,679
Like, what do I do to people?

93
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,829
Bekah: It's the best you have.
You have the, the energy. So, I

94
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,943
guess my answer is just more
Mike Rogers in my

95
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:13,838
Dan: There you go. We just need
an unlimited supply of Mike and

96
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,709
we'll, we'll be in good shape.

97
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,639
Bekah: So we're so excited to
have you here with us on the

98
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,928
podcast. Thank you for being
here. And we always like to get

99
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:27,013
started with the origin story.
So tell us how you got to this

100
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,098
point

101
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:29,908
in your life.

102
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,644
Mike: say I was really dreading
this because my story is so

103
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:38,363
vanilla that I was going through
my notes and I was like, I don't

104
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,994
think it could be any more
boring. It was a very typical

105
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,004
entry in to tech. Well, I was
building websites when I was

106
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:46,014
like

107
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,973
little, like when I was like 12,
14, just in Dreamweaver. If you

108
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:54,173
remember that. Oh, tool from
Adobe. Oh, I loved it. I good.

109
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,624
And then I'd be like go to like
school and I'll show my friends

110
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,903
and then we'd all like start
building websites and have them

111
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:03,564
online for free. And then very
quickly I was like, Oh, I really

112
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,904
enjoyed this. This is really
fun. Then I went to university

113
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,244
and I

114
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:12,173
had some identity CS degree, but
very focused on web. And that

115
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:13,973
was, that was great fun. And
then I just ended up kind of

116
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,773
getting a

117
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,254
job, like vaguely and what I
wanted to do, like someone told

118
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,644
me Ruby on Rails is like quite a
fun framework. And I was like,

119
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,249
yeah. it does look fun. I done
some PHP, but then yeah, I think

120
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,928
did Ruby and it was like, oh, I
like this. This is, this is a

121
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,759
pretty language. So I was like,
I like you have an ice cream

122
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:34,829
Bekah: Okay.

123
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,473
Mike: be the best way to
describe my reaction to that.

124
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:38,047
And then,

125
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,588
um, to kind of fast forward to
how I got to where I am now, I

126
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,328
had like a few years where,
like, I was kind of quite happy

127
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,068
just

128
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,344
traveling around like the
world's kind of freelancing and

129
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,619
doing a

130
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:51,264
bit of work. And more recently,
like I wanted to kind of get a

131
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,539
bit more stability in my life
and then have like a full-time

132
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:53,814
job

133
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,754
where it's like, oh, I actually
get paychecks every month for

134
00:05:56,754 --> 00:06:00,923
like, doing work as opposed to
not getting paid sometimes as a

135
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,874
freelancer, which is very scary.
Um,

136
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:05,288
Dan: Yes.

137
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,939
Bekah: that's rough.

138
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:06,894
Mike: That's pretty much

139
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:10,134
Bekah: So were you a digital
nomad or.

140
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:14,454
Mike: Um, that was what I was
going for for like so long. I

141
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,093
really enjoyed, it was like the
best few years like all my life.

142
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,913
I was just like, I was just
jumping between like major

143
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,758
cities, but like, I find the
best in that I find amazing

144
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,603
coworking

145
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:28,108
spaces and I'd just work and I'd
have such a good time. Um, I'm

146
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,759
also a quite anti-authority
person, so it's quite nice kind

147
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,229
of going against the grain and
finding people who are similar

148
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,699
to

149
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,574
that. So I also got featured on
a magazine as well. I think he

150
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,449
may

151
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,178
have seen the picture where I'm
just kind of sitting outside on

152
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:43,899
my laptop, just like working in
some of his like, ah, cool. I'm

153
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,988
going to right now to go about
you and I'm like, do it. And

154
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:47,619
Yeah. then she did,

155
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:52,384
Bekah: It's like at a top of a
very high place. And Mike is

156
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:53,704
sitting there with it.

157
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,793
Mike: Yeah. There was some other
shots as well. I also had a dog

158
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:58,603
with me at the time.

159
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,377
Bekah: Were there. Did you have
favorite places that you like to

160
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:04,861
work from or was your goal just
to go as many places as

161
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,345
possible?

162
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,117
Mike: So originally my goal was
to go see all these places like,

163
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:13,427
which I'd read about in
magazines, but very quickly I

164
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,911
realized the places I wanted to
go as a tourist, was different

165
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,395
to

166
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,166
where I want it to go to like
live for like a few months. So

167
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,936
my

168
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:24,797
favorite places, like kind of in
no particular order Berlin, like

169
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:29,086
the city in Germany, um, there's
some really nice like meetup

170
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:32,237
groups there where they're so
friendly and I'm still friends

171
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,036
with the people I met in those
meetup groups. One of them

172
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,346
tweeted me yesterday saying we
miss Mike. And I was like, oh,

173
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:39,676
That's wild. And then, um,
Prague as well, I went to a

174
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:42,376
wonderful

175
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,259
coworking space there. It was.
The owner was an American guy

176
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,141
and

177
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,122
he's just like, I just wanted to
make friends. So I started a

178
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:51,512
co-working space and I was like,
I like, I liked this guy's same

179
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:56,252
mindset. And then, um, I tons of
actual, like crazy places. I

180
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,432
really enjoy Japan. Like it's a
bit more tricky to work there.

181
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:02,192
Like I guess working remotely.
Isn't, wasn't a thing when I was

182
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:06,512
there, but I've really enjoyed
just kind of this, the Japanness

183
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,141
of everything.

184
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,911
Bekah: So where you just were
the, were you working consistent

185
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,252
contracts that just kind of
allowed you to go to these

186
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,982
different places? Or were you
trying to pick up contracts as

187
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,281
you're moving? That just sounds
like a lot of logistics, like,

188
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,312
well, I need work and I need a
place to stay any place that has

189
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:26,512
internet, you know?

190
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,322
Mike: Oh, luckily I was young
and happy to wing it. Um, every

191
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,257
time.

192
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:33,761
It was bad. In hindsight, I
think I was like a little bit

193
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:35,965
crazy. I

194
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,777
didn't even have like any money
at the time, but like to cover

195
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,232
like places to live. I would
like do pet sitting where people

196
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,657
would

197
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,746
go on holiday and that normally
I just feel so by who has the

198
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,601
fastest internet. And then I
just go to that person's house.

199
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,456
That

200
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:53,386
worked really well. Um, and then
to actually find work, I had a

201
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,351
few like startups, I kind of
knew about who needed work every

202
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,316
now

203
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,177
and again. And they would kind
of keep me going here and there.

204
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,037
And

205
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,446
then sometimes I'd have to like,
do some really terrible

206
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:03,855
freelance

207
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,221
work, which I hated doing where
it was like the stressful kind

208
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,586
of

209
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,076
you, you wouldn't pick this
project unless you were like

210
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,574
really styling kind of freelance
work. Um, I always had this

211
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:14,042
dream

212
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,052
and it was this, the worst
dream, like kind of go out with,

213
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,062
uh, I

214
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,881
was like, I'd have enough energy
to make my own startup. And I

215
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,221
could be the guy who's just like
sitting on a beach and ending

216
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,821
like that passive income. And
every time I tried, I never

217
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,401
quite

218
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:29,902
like finish any of the projects.
I had lots of fun.

219
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:33,891
Bekah: Yeah, that sounds
awesome. And really exciting.

220
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:36,441
And so.

221
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:36,932
Mike: to live.

222
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,651
Bekah: You went from being a
digital nomad to kind of

223
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:41,826
deciding

224
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:49,267
that you needed something more
stable and that, ahead. Talk

225
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:49,807
about that a little bit.

226
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:55,386
Mike: Yeah. So I started hitting
this problem and it was so it's

227
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,787
such an uncomfortable thing to
talk about, but when you're

228
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:00,246
freelancing, you generally are
going to stick to what you're

229
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:03,486
really good at. So with me, it
was like, okay, I'm really good

230
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:06,307
at this very small particular
thing. That's where I know I'm

231
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:10,731
definitely going to get. And I
kept doing that and doing that.

232
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:16,011
And I just felt like I wasn't
really making any progress in my

233
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:20,782
career. Like I'd hit like a, a
wall where the next place to go

234
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,972
was no, as like some kind of kid
who just turns up with his

235
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:25,162
laptop

236
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,402
every now and again. And I got
super sad because I talked to my

237
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:31,147
friends who. Work together in a
company like many years ago and

238
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,892
I

239
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:36,772
chat to them and then we'd be
comparing our salaries because,

240
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:41,481
you know, that's such a good
thing to do. And I was I'd come

241
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,761
back. And I was like, I thought
I was doing really well, but now

242
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,342
one of my friends is earning
twice as much as me. And he

243
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:46,912
seems

244
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,272
so much more like stable in his
life. And he's where everything

245
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,937
kind of a bit more like just,
just a couple of his like Eggs

246
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,572
in

247
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,011
a row. Is it egg ducks in a row?
That's the one not exited,

248
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:56,450
right.

249
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,412
That would be horrific.

250
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,147
Dan: eggs eggs in a basket ducks
in a row

251
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,256
Mike: Yeah,

252
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:01,966
Bekah: Lux have

253
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:02,726
Mike: the one.

254
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,126
Bekah: can be in the row with
them.

255
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,221
Mike: And I started kind of
thinking, right. I really need

256
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:08,361
to

257
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,597
solve this because if I don't
push myself, I'm going to be

258
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,532
that

259
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,287
person. And I met a few of these
were traveling where I would

260
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,042
chat

261
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,532
to them. And I just was like,
what are you doing? Like you're,

262
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:22,461
as soon as like, maybe your
technology goes, you don't have

263
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,371
anything to fall back on to. So
you could just wake up one day

264
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,402
completely unemployed and you'll
have to scramble to get work and

265
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:32,496
you don't have too much more.
And yeah, so I really. Really

266
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,906
struggled. So I thought the
first best thing to do is maybe

267
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,316
come

268
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:38,616
back to the UK, settle down a
little bit, or try and find

269
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:42,336
something a bit more stable,
which was, uh, an exciting

270
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:43,821
adventure as well. Like I
managed to find some pretty, uh,

271
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,306
pretty

272
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,996
fun startup to work for, which
was very relaxing. And, uh, they

273
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:52,476
kind of were able to change me a
little bit more. And I've really

274
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:57,216
got out of my like little quiet
shell of like, Okay. I can do

275
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,922
some little bits of rails, but
now. They're forcing me to kind

276
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:04,042
of learn all these other things
like server administration, how

277
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,172
to optimize databases, how to
really be fantastic at like

278
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,302
front

279
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,506
end. And that was, that was
quite a fun one to, uh, to

280
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,710
chase.

281
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,206
Dan: Was that a I'm sorry. I was
just going to say, was that, was

282
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,486
that still a contracting at that
point? Or was that like a

283
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,192
Mike: Oh, that was like a
full-time role. That was wild.

284
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,761
Um, that was like my first
full-time job. And like, I want

285
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,041
to say it was like three or four
years at the time. And, uh,

286
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,321
yeah,

287
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,641
it was so weird. Like every day
it's like, oh, cool. I have a

288
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:32,960
job

289
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,361
to go to. This is great. Um,
compared to where I'd ended up

290
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,932
and it was so fun, like kind of
looking back on the, kind of the

291
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:45,402
projects I had been doing, like
there's like a certain trait to

292
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,616
projects where they can only
hire people for like a short

293
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,830
amount of

294
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,081
time. I'm sure you everyone has
like, kind of encountered this

295
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,697
where if they can only have a
developer for like three. Months

296
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:57,427
in a year, they're going to
really cram in what they have to

297
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,626
do, and they're going to triple
it really hard to get stuff

298
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,825
done.

299
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,246
And very quickly projects become
awful to work on, like where

300
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:06,036
it's

301
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:08,016
like, instead of like a nice
logically laid out CSS file.

302
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,995
It's

303
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:13,447
going to be like all over the
show, possibly even one big like

304
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:19,767
cluster spaghetti mess. And so I
try, I'm very, very careful not

305
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,496
to make you put an explicit tag
on this podcast as the heads-up.

306
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:24,716
Dan: Yeah.

307
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,016
Mike: then Yeah. also some of
the products were so old. Um,

308
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,306
and

309
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,417
then being able to kind of work
in a company and be like, Hey,

310
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,527
if

311
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:33,027
we put some time into this, we
can, we can be way happier. And

312
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,927
like three weeks time, can we do
that? And then they're like,

313
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,057
Yeah. which was quite nice.

314
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:40,706
Bekah: So I want to back up for
a second here. So you talked

315
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,296
about

316
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,947
Mike: I've like, run through
quite quickly. I'm like,

317
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,343
Bekah: no, no, this is great.
Um, This, you started to feel

318
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,590
this

319
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,652
sense of there's a lack of
stability, starting to feel

320
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:55,192
stagnant, where you are. So at
what point did that happen? And

321
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:58,642
like, was it that conversation
about salary that really helped

322
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,761
you to understand that? Or how
did you recognize that?

323
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:06,871
Mike: It was a really difficult
thing to actually recognize. So

324
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:10,172
the conversation about like
salaries was the starting point

325
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,432
of like, getting that ball going
of going, oh no, I need to fix

326
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:20,692
some stuff. So as soon as I
started thinking, Okay. Actually

327
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,142
I've done very similar projects
and I'm not pushing myself

328
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:25,732
anymore. Like my career is like,
if you were to go look at my

329
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,322
work

330
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,412
history, it's like I was doing
the exact same job over and over

331
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:35,542
and over, like was on a, on a
treadmill almost. And for a lot

332
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,682
of the jobs, I was like, I can't
even remember doing half of

333
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:37,822
them.

334
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,851
I can see the paycheck there and
I can see the customer name, but

335
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:42,726
I couldn't tell you what was
special about that. And that

336
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:44,601
was,

337
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,187
that was cool. It was quite
jarring as well, like really

338
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:51,216
strange feeling. And it's like,
huh, am I unhappy? Or what's,

339
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:54,697
what's causing this unhappiness
because it's, I'm not satisfied

340
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:59,197
with the work I'm doing and not
sure how to get around it. And I

341
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,956
kind of jumped the Cal ended up
kind of like solving it very

342
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:06,067
quickly there. But like, as soon
as I started becoming aware that

343
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,076
I needed to start pushing myself
a bit more and the steps I had

344
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,085
to

345
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,673
make as well to correct that.
Was very, very difficult. Um,

346
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:15,260
but it

347
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,751
paid off quite quickly. Um, and
I'd love to go into some of the

348
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,542
things I started doing as well.
Would that be Okay.

349
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:21,427
Bekah: Oh yeah,

350
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,861
Mike: cause it, it wasn't like I
got depressed and then I got a

351
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,721
job. That was a lot of the
middle. It was like,

352
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:30,572
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I
think, you know, once you

353
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:33,302
recognize, start to recognize
these things, like you said, it

354
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:37,042
wasn't easy. There was a. You
know, a variety of things that

355
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,396
had to happen. And so
recognizing is step one and then

356
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,750
really

357
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,261
diving into that middle part, I
think is important because we

358
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,711
often get the stories of, well,
then I decided I made this

359
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:52,341
decision and then everybody fast
forward through all of the hard

360
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,532
parts of things. So I would love
to hear

361
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,021
Mike: Yeah. Let's jump into the
hard part. So I want to say

362
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,490
like,

363
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:03,432
The lowest point I had was I
remember the sitting in bed one

364
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:05,096
morning and I woke up and I was
like, I don't even want to put

365
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,760
my

366
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:10,871
feet on the floor. I'm so
miserable and unhappy with just

367
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:14,442
the state of things. It's a
really weird feeling to be like,

368
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:18,731
oh, I'm earning quite good money
doing something. I think I quite

369
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:21,161
like, but I don't even want to
like, literally roll, put my

370
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:23,591
feet

371
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,721
on the, and press the power
button on my computer this

372
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:32,376
morning. Like that is too much.
that was definitely a morning. I

373
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,326
remember the morning really
distinctly, whereas it's like,

374
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:38,076
oh, this is, this could go
downhill really fast. And I was

375
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:41,616
even thinking, do I want to
leave tech because do I enjoy

376
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,307
programming for fun and actually
getting paid for it. is the

377
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:47,279
issue. And, Um, then I remember
actually I really like the

378
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,251
money.

379
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,491
That's that's, that's definitely
a good motivator. So I was like,

380
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,062
it's probably not that. And I
quickly made a list of all the

381
00:16:56,062 --> 00:17:00,547
things I wanted to be. Very soon
on it in the future, I was like,

382
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,966
well, what are, what is some
small bit of all the people I

383
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,817
follow online or really like,
what's something small they've

384
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,686
done, which I really want to
copy. So one was I follow a

385
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:13,656
developer who he contributes a
lot to open source and I was

386
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,237
like, okay. well, I don't have
to contribute a lot. I can just

387
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:19,747
maybe contribute just a little
bit and have my little piece

388
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,586
there. And then I started
watching YouTube tutorials a

389
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:27,787
little bit. And there's a
particular guy that's into Chris

390
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,226
Oliver. I always really liked
his style where he just does a

391
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,665
quick

392
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,426
10 minute video every now and
again. And I was like, Okay. I

393
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,541
really like that. then the final
thing, I was like, well, all of

394
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,656
a

395
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,332
sudden. I also want to make sure
I write down the things I know

396
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:44,721
just in case I get really bored
and no one finds my videos and

397
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,001
then we'll find some way
principles work. So at least

398
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,411
maybe some of them I can at
least solve someone's problem.

399
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,490
If I

400
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:50,856
don't stick on with this depth
stuff. So I started like

401
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,221
blogging

402
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:55,432
again, and you can see it in my
blog post, by the way, you can

403
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:58,761
see like the dips as like, when
I was taking breaks and then

404
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,221
suddenly, like I started doing
stuff again, and then it like

405
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,011
quietens down a bit while I have
a job. And then it's like, ah, I

406
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:05,271
have to take it back off again.
Now I want to like do more

407
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:06,531
stuff.

408
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,761
But that was, that was kind of
the main things I was doing. So

409
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,196
I

410
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:15,576
made this list and I started
working through the list. And as

411
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:17,346
I started working through, I
started talking to my friends

412
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,497
about this and turns out they
were all in the same scenario

413
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:24,636
where they were all like, not
quite satisfied and they're all

414
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:30,172
working. On the little things to
try and like boost their careers

415
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:34,041
and get to that next level where
they can just do interesting,

416
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,706
challenging work, where they're
gonna get paid pretty well. And

417
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:37,161
I

418
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:41,751
have a really good friend called
Tom Cadwell and we, we worked

419
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,821
together when we were 20. We
paired every day and then we

420
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,891
both

421
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:50,511
went our separate ways. And then
we've texted like pretty much

422
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:55,686
once a week about what we're
doing. And. He's like, he's like

423
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:58,737
me to other how people would
describe me to other people. And

424
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,867
I'm like, really, Jerry he's
that for me? And it's like,

425
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:00,997
cool,

426
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:05,196
cool, nice. And we have like a
bet between us, like dollar bets

427
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,717
for like, who's going to get the
most followers on certain things

428
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,237
or he's going to get the most
views. And that was really

429
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:14,817
brilliant. Up. It's like, well,
helped me kind of keep sticking

430
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:18,836
with the things I was doing. So
like, I think Right. now we have

431
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:22,977
a bet for, who's gonna have the
base of YouTube followers by the

432
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,551
end of the year and he's
winning. So I really want to

433
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,125
work hard to

434
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:30,356
fix that. Um, but so once I kind
of side working through this

435
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:35,576
anyway, and felt more confident
to apply for those harder jobs

436
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,946
where maybe I might actually be
challenged a bit during the day.

437
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:43,402
And cause it's, I hate applying
for jobs. It's like the worst

438
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,912
experience. If you it's like,
it's almost like dating apps

439
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,461
where it's like, you're going to
be rejected thousands of times

440
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:52,821
and that's gonna like destroy
you, but it could be that one

441
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,821
thousands times actually the
perfect person for you. So you

442
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,771
kind of have to stick with it.
So like, I would apply for jobs

443
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,721
and

444
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,656
I'd keep upping the ante each
time and I'm like, Okay. I know

445
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,051
a

446
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,776
few of these things and I'm
going to do everything I can to

447
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,501
do it.

448
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:12,116
Or. Feel competent about what
I'm applying for. So that worked

449
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:15,836
quite well. And as I was doing
this, I found the best way to

450
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,171
find out about Joseph was
through local meetups and stuff.

451
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,506
So user

452
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:22,467
groups, and that was great. Um,
that was like, oh cool. By

453
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,196
meeting all these friends and a
little tip for everyone, um,

454
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,717
meetups are a great way to find
a job. It's like you meet the

455
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:30,057
people who are going to be
interviewing you beforehand. You

456
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:33,356
can figure out if they're like
nice people or not. So I highly

457
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,431
recommend that. Yeah. that was
kind of like what I did. And

458
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,506
then

459
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,936
eventually, like, as I was
waiting for you, the stagnation

460
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,931
feeling, I came out the other
side and then I was like, Okay.

461
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:43,926
I

462
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,656
don't feel stagnant anymore. I'm
being challenged. I'm surrounded

463
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:49,626
by really smart people. And I
felt like I've really, really

464
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:52,596
was

465
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,356
going, but I was back on track
where I want it to be like, when

466
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:58,477
I kind of compared myself to my
friends, I was like, cool. We

467
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,377
were all kind of back on the
same level. Now I managed to

468
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:00,277
very

469
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:05,076
quickly level myself up and.
That, that was a great feeling.

470
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,186
And it kinda made me think about
like how your career is kind of

471
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:13,116
like a garden as well. Um, who
it will be. This metaphor works

472
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,711
where if you kind of like,
forget about your garden and let

473
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:18,306
it grow

474
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:22,626
wild. It's going to not be a
great garden and you've got to

475
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,786
sit there and maintain it. And
so you can, you know, plow the

476
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,736
pow

477
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,646
pow, the grass, put it in, but
you also have to like, let it

478
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,557
grow as well organically like,
you can't sit there, poking the

479
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,416
seeds because the seeds will
never grow. You've got to like

480
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:37,807
water it and maybe brush the
soil. I don't know much about

481
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,007
gardening. Is that really?

482
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,362
Bekah: Yeah, that's a British
method that I am not aware of.

483
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:46,122
Dan: Sure, sure. Yeah.

484
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:46,576
Mike: maybe.

485
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,586
Dan: Get the soil brush out.

486
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,586
Mike: Yeah. That's this, put it
down as a British thing.

487
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,531
Dan: Well, it's it's that's
what's the point of the

488
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:55,521
gardening

489
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:58,011
pick? You pick that up and none
of Japan, right? I'm pretty sure

490
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,531
that's the Japanese soil brush.
Yeah.

491
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,856
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You have
to, you have to be in your

492
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,797
bathroom. I said, well, you're
doing stuff. It's like, it's a

493
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:06,366
relaxing thing.

494
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,686
Bekah: They do in the bathroom.

495
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,676
Dan: that's a different,
different brush. Um, I, my guy,

496
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,281
I

497
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,966
love this metaphor. I, uh, I
was, um, I was just thinking

498
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,651
about

499
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,811
what you're talking, you know,
and, and yet, and there's a lot

500
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,221
of different, there's a lot of
different things you can do with

501
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,021
a garden. Right. And there's a
lot of different things you can

502
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:27,071
do, um, with your career, you
know, you could plant a bunch of

503
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,172
different things and kind of
tend them all.

504
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:30,537
Mike: Yeah.

505
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:31,732
Dan: maybe like, w were you
doing before? Like as a

506
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:32,842
freelancer or

507
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:33,382
something, right,

508
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,726
Mike: Yeah. Or you could focus
on like certain individual

509
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,195
things.

510
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,997
So you feel like, you know what
carrots, that's going to be. My

511
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:42,267
thing for this month, you can
agree on carrots. Or if you want

512
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:43,946
to have a big tree, which is
going to take a long time to

513
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,346
grow, where you put the seeds in
and you look after it, maybe you

514
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:51,086
put some like steaks in to help
it grow straight and strong. And

515
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:54,567
that's a lot like a career in a
way. And also sometimes you just

516
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,477
need to have people to help you
with things like doing stuff on

517
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:01,297
your own is hard. Like. It's so
much easier to have help from

518
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,027
other people, especially if
you're doing something big or

519
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:05,841
heavy, or even just asking
people like, Hey, how, how far

520
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,655
apart

521
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,266
should I plant these like
carrots? It's like, yeah, I

522
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,876
don't

523
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,006
know how far apart you should
put carrots. But when I have

524
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,136
grown

525
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,926
carrots, I put them too close
together and they ended up

526
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:17,616
bunching together.

527
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,902
Bekah: Oh, yeah. There's lots of
things like that. And even like,

528
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:26,041
if you think about weeding and
how that applies to sometimes we

529
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,221
pick up bad habits. Right.

530
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:28,432
Mike: Oh, yes

531
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,177
Bekah: we do need some help,
like taking care of that part of

532
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,922
it or

533
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:36,332
recognizing that like, oh wait,
that that's not a tomato plant.

534
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,892
That's this weed that looks
similar to a tomato plant, which

535
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,567
I have in my garden right now.
Right. I've got an app to

536
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:48,096
identify these things now. So
see, I found help. Um, and, and

537
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,186
this applies to, at so many
different stages of the career

538
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:53,076
too. I love it. Like this idea
of it can be so hard to be

539
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,966
patient

540
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,166
when you are learning something
new, but that idea, like, look,

541
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,304
it doesn't, these things don't
grow overnight. Put tomato

542
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:03,412
plants

543
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:07,041
in, in June. And I don't have
tomatoes that are red yet. It

544
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,276
just takes a while and you have
to give it nutrients. You have

545
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:11,511
to

546
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:15,981
feed it. And, and then that's
when you collect the, you know,

547
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,332
the things that you've worked so
hard for.

548
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:21,169
Mike: Yeah. the super nice ones.
That's super good. Yeah. Um, so

549
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,307
I

550
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,557
had something in there and then
it is wished completely out my

551
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:28,176
brain. It's like, there's no
thought.

552
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:30,426
Dan: I was going too far in the
metaphor. I was trying to figure

553
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,596
out how to keep, you know, how
do you keep chipmunks and

554
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,766
squirrels

555
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:36,156
out of your career and kind of,
I don't think I've, I haven't, I

556
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:36,606
haven't found that.

557
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:41,346
Mike: I have one good thought
though, it's like, I'm getting

558
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,537
rid of those bad habits as well.
Cause that's the other thing,

559
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:46,626
which is, I feel keeps so many
people back is like they develop

560
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:51,517
all these bad things. Problems
in their, like how they approach

561
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:56,497
problems or like other aspects.
So a good example is let's say

562
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:58,341
you have a developer who's very
bad at writing commit messages

563
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,185
or

564
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:03,817
doing pull requests. And if you
were to work with them, that

565
00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:06,037
would probably rub off on you.
And then if you went to another

566
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,177
company, they might look at that
when they're interviewing you

567
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:08,317
and

568
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:11,406
be like, no, you're bad at this
one particular thing we really

569
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:15,217
care about. And I found the best
thing to do is like constantly.

570
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:20,136
Almost work in public, as much
as you can and ask for constant

571
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:23,076
feedback or say, I've got this
like little hot tip for anyone

572
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:26,527
who's kind of senior. Um, and is
kind of in that. position where

573
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,877
they're like, have I picked up
bad habits, pay with junior

574
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,227
devs?

575
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:31,746
They're like, they're fresh out
of like, uh, like the cancel

576
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,935
that

577
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,241
causes. You can teach them a
lot, but also you can see what

578
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,546
they're

579
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,121
doing differently to you. And
I've been pairing with my

580
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,695
junior.

581
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,076
Uh, they're not a junior
developer, they're just a

582
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,717
developer, but, um, they call
themselves junior and I'm like,

583
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:46,747
don't call yourself junior. I
digress. Okay. So I've been

584
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:49,176
pairing with one of my
colleagues and they're

585
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:51,605
fantastic, and they

586
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:53,061
do things a bit differently to
me. And I don't want to tell

587
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,516
them

588
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:55,897
that. I think they're actually
doing it a bit better.

589
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:57,277
Sometimes,

590
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:02,317
um, quietly changing a lot of my
habits now because they've

591
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,606
obviously found a more efficient
way because they just entered

592
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:04,895
the

593
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,281
industry at a different time
where like all these extra

594
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,666
things

595
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,576
I do aren't required anymore.
Like I've just picked up

596
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,211
something from somewhere where
it's like maybe using get

597
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:15,846
version

598
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:20,511
control where it's like, the way
I change my branch is. The worst

599
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,801
way possible or how I emerged
that there's like an easy way

600
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,091
now

601
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,816
there's like, and I'm just
completely wishing on it, um,

602
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,540
the

603
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,832
whole time. Um, so Yeah, that's,
that's been one of those little

604
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:33,321
hot tips, which is like
completely changed and I highly

605
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:35,481
recommend it's pairing with
anyone and anyone who will help

606
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:35,662
you

607
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:37,961
Dan: I think that's great. I
think it's great advice. I

608
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,115
wanted

609
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:42,817
to call out real quick. Your
piece of advice, right before

610
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,331
that, which was, you know,
working in public, uh, as ways

611
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:45,845
to

612
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,396
improve your, you know, your own
skills or whatever your habits,

613
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:53,166
every, all of that. Um, I think
that's huge. And if you, um, I

614
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,546
find myself lots of times I'm
writing code that I know I'm

615
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,926
only

616
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:59,136
going to see probably, or, you
know, most likely I'm the only

617
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,237
one that's ever going to look at
it lots of times. And I'll find

618
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:05,842
myself doing that, that same
thing kind of maybe, um, Not

619
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:08,902
explaining things as well, or
whatever, making commit messages

620
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,721
that don't actually say anything
or all of that writing, writing

621
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:14,602
issues that are just one line
instead of explaining the actual

622
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,082
process. And as soon as I find
myself working where I know

623
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:19,972
there's going to be other
people, whether it's work work

624
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,862
or where I

625
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,991
know there's going to be a
couple of people or open-source

626
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,060
stuff,

627
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:29,392
public stuff where I know like
possibly everybody could see it,

628
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:34,747
you know, Uh, almost forces you
to do it well, you know? Um, and

629
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:37,626
if you do it enough, it becomes
like you were saying, I have it,

630
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:39,521
you know, as opposed to, um, but
it kind of feels like pain. And

631
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,325
I

632
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:42,906
find myself personally doing
that more, even with my own

633
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,466
stuff,

634
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:47,106
just because it's like, oh, this
is just how I do write an issue

635
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:47,527
now, you know?

636
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,636
Mike: You have that feeling. I'm
going to be sitting behind you,

637
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,666
reading it back to you in a
snarky voice. Right? That's

638
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:57,207
that's what I do for everything
online. Now, every tweet I read,

639
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:59,547
it's like I do in my snarky
voice. Every time I write when

640
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,226
it's in my snarky voice. And
it's like, ah, this bug's

641
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:02,905
broken. I

642
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,067
can hint how you reproduce it.
It's like good. Right. There's

643
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,476
all these steps and as soon as
the snarky voice disappears,

644
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,885
it's

645
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,411
like, right. It's a, it's a
good, a good. issue a good pull

646
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,936
request

647
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:19,251
Dan: that's amazing. That's
amazing. Yeah. Somebody, um, A

648
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:22,912
Virtual Coffee a while ago.
Actually, I think it started on

649
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,882
the podcast, but, um, somebody,
one of the random questions was,

650
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:28,402
you know, who would you want to
have narrating your life or your

651
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,142
inner monologue or something
like that. And, um, somebody

652
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,882
mentioned

653
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,422
Alan Rickman and then I couldn't
just like, for the rest of the

654
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,561
day I had Snape like professor
Snape hanging over my head doing

655
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:42,112
the exact same thing, except in
like his like sarcastic, you

656
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:47,991
know, slow like, oh, does can't
reproduce the bug, Potter. Like

657
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,481
just like the sneering, you
know, at my like bad commit

658
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:50,971
messages

659
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:56,271
Mike: that's one I want Nikki T
to be like the guy Who narrates

660
00:28:56,271 --> 00:29:00,051
my life, because, so I've got
such like a, like a dev crush on

661
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,271
him where it's like, when he
starts like working in public,

662
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:05,182
it's like, I want to do that.
That's what I want to do. Like

663
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:06,672
his confidence there is
incredible.

664
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:08,051
Dan: Yeah.

665
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,617
Mike: You've got me wanting to
do an Alan Rickman impression.

666
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:10,902
Okay.

667
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:11,521
Bekah: Okay. Do

668
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:11,682
Mike: it.

669
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:13,281
Dan: yes, we need it.

670
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:17,296
Mike: Ah, on the spot! Good
work, Potter. Shoot the glass. I

671
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:20,591
don't

672
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,092
think that's very good. Yeah.

673
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,356
Dan: Yeah. Oh man. He's the
best. Yeah. That the idea

674
00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:30,651
though, of

675
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:34,991
just putting it in public, you
know, even if it's, um, it

676
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:39,382
doesn't seem like. Yeah. I don't
know. It doesn't like, not meant

677
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:40,987
for an audience, you know,
you're not like, uh, performing

678
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,592
or

679
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:45,412
whatever. Uh, I think I still
think it just helps so much. I

680
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:46,791
think that's great. Great
advice.

681
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,031
Mike: Yeah. And honestly all
it's the little things as well,

682
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,701
because if you're thinking this
is in the public, now you're not

683
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:53,856
going to do like the little
silly mistakes, like

684
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:55,011
accidentally

685
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,841
committing SSH keys or
something, or APA keys to

686
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:58,641
version control.

687
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,011
And then in a few months later,
um, when you decide, I don't

688
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:03,021
want

689
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:05,211
to do this project anymore, or
even open source of the project.

690
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:07,372
You don't find it. You go, oh
no, I have to nuke all the

691
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,862
history.

692
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:09,362
Um,

693
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:10,271
Dan: Right. right,

694
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,877
Mike: in case, um, if you look
at it, I've got two projects by

695
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,402
the

696
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,571
way, where I nuked the history,
because I did exactly that. And

697
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,740
I

698
00:30:15,741 --> 00:30:17,451
really regretted that
afterwards. It was like, it was

699
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,161
like two

700
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:20,677
years of like get version
control history. And I was like,

701
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,192
I just,

702
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:24,471
just nuked them. Cause I
couldn't remember what was in

703
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:26,181
there, but I

704
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,561
wish I had done something a bit
better.

705
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,892
Dan: Yeah, who knows? There's
probably ways to handle that,

706
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,392
but

707
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:34,241
yeah, like, yeah, having that
plan in the back of your head,

708
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,731
maybe this eventually open
source. Yeah. I think, I think

709
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:39,761
helps helps your instincts kind
of cover that sort of thing.

710
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,602
Yeah, for sure.

711
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,757
Mike: so that one day will say,
like I was working on a project

712
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:47,807
and my friend texted me, um, my
friend Tom Familia. And he said,

713
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:49,216
by the way, you're on the front
page of Reddit. And it was on

714
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:50,625
the

715
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:52,774
front page of like one of the
small. Four bucks a subreddit.

716
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:54,922
So

717
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:57,741
it wasn't like front front page,
but someone had just found my

718
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,986
code base and was just sharing
it and talking about it. And I

719
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:00,231
was

720
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,501
like, this is wild. It was only,
I think only like 25 people

721
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,866
actually looked at it. Like
maybe write some comments, but

722
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,231
it was

723
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,206
like overall, everyone was
really polite and nice. And I

724
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:10,181
was like,

725
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,582
I didn't expect that at all. I
always assume people on the

726
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,291
internet, they're going to be
terrible people, but

727
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:18,731
overwhelmingly, most people are
very nice and I just very happy

728
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,991
to see how other people work.
I'm very happy to see something

729
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:22,311
shared.

730
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,679
Bekah: I'm, I'm going to back up
a little bit, because I just

731
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,181
wanted to highlight this point
that you see. Um, I've, I've

732
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,683
just

733
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:34,344
found that there are so many
people who have been developers

734
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:36,984
for a while who are also failing
like this stagnation that I

735
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:39,624
think

736
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,888
kind of can lead to burnout.
And, and you, you know, you even

737
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:44,003
said

738
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,963
like, Uh, this mean that I leave
tech, should I try something

739
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,864
else? And you said, you know, it
was, um, the morning that you

740
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:53,288
woke up and you're like,
dreaded, hit hitting the power

741
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,712
button.

742
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:59,044
Right. Like you just felt this
dread. And I think that it's, I

743
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,794
just want to highlight that
because I think that not enough

744
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,564
people recognize like, okay,
this is, this is a bad point.

745
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,334
Like

746
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:10,973
this is time to evaluate some
things and change some ways. So

747
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:14,963
do you think. No. How do you
think that you, can you prevent

748
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:19,284
that from happening? Um, or if
you could go back and do things

749
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:22,794
differently, is there something
that you would do to avoid that

750
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:23,334
stagnation?

751
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:30,169
Mike: Oh, it's, it's a difficult
question. Um, so when I entered

752
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,449
Ruby, there were two really
prominent Rubyists. So Ryan B

753
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,729
and

754
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,674
_why. And they are two
developers who kind of very

755
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:42,189
famously left

756
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,613
one day and never came back. And
for one of them, we were like,

757
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,037
is

758
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,249
he Okay. What's happened to this
guy. And I want to say there was

759
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:50,709
an article in the New York times
saying, like what happened to

760
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,434
this person who was like
everywhere? And then one day

761
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,159
just

762
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,858
disappeared. And I think they
turned out to be a manager at

763
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,653
Walmart in the end. And like
someone like track them down,

764
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:00,448
but

765
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,993
for private investigator and
that always sat in the back of

766
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,537
my head

767
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,489
going Okay. Um, so people do
leave every now and again and

768
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,484
just decide they want to get
away from whatever life they've

769
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:10,479
just

770
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:17,378
created, because it's just not
doing it for them. And things I

771
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:22,419
would do definitely is I wish I
had a bigger support network of

772
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,699
like dev people. Um, back when I
was, when I was like really

773
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,949
peak,

774
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:31,733
unhappy, I didn't have anyone to
talk to. Like I had like maybe

775
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,503
five other developers I knew,
and I wasn't that close with

776
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,273
them.

777
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:41,304
And I just wish I could have had
someone to be like, Hey, I'm

778
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:46,913
feeling this. Has anyone else
felt this? What did they do? And

779
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,814
that wasn't, it's not that it
wasn't a thing. It's just, I

780
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:54,354
hadn't found it yet. So I almost
want to like encourage everyone

781
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:57,713
to. Grow that professional
network, you know, that, that

782
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:00,203
little fish in the garden of the
professional network of people

783
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,523
here, like be like this, there
fee to answer some questions.

784
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,843
And

785
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,423
if you send them a private
message, there'll be like

786
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,364
sympathetic to be like, Okay.
cool. Now I can, I can help you

787
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,914
with this. And if you want to
jump on a call, so we'll go out

788
00:34:12,914 --> 00:34:17,414
for coffee, then that's, that's
something that we'll do. And I

789
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:20,054
think it's easier now. Like
thanks to the global pandemic.

790
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,543
There's like plays a nice slack
groups and you can pick out your

791
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,523
individual people. You're ready.
You know, make part of your,

792
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,224
like, you know, inner circle of
like people you already trust.

793
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,443
Have you guys heard about the
thing where you only have like a

794
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,313
hundred and full, proper close
friends? Like that theory? Um,

795
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:38,469
Dan: Yeah, I vaguely, I
definitely am familiar with, you

796
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:38,918
know, what you're

797
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:40,719
Mike: Yeah. Like it's some kind
of human thing where you can

798
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,384
only

799
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:46,014
keep track of so many people
properly. And so if you've only

800
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:48,114
got like a hundred friends, some
of them are going to be family.

801
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:49,669
Some of them that'd be like old
school friends maybe. And I

802
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:51,224
think

803
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:54,884
you should probably pick like a
few key developers or people in

804
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,578
your field who you really like,
and let's keep them in that

805
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:58,272
light

806
00:34:58,273 --> 00:35:02,893
we'll circle of a hundred people
who could sit in your phone book

807
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:03,403
or something.

808
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:10,391
Dan: I think that's great. I,
uh, having somebody who. Is in

809
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,591
whatever field you're in, you
know, and can understand a lot

810
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:12,791
of

811
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,851
the context that goes around. I,
you know, a close friend from,

812
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:19,121
from when you were young, even
somebody who you keep in touch

813
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,546
with, uh, but isn't it a
complete different field. Um,

814
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:21,971
when always

815
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:25,782
have the context, you know,
somebody that might be like,

816
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,851
well, you just, you have a good
job that pays well, why are you

817
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:29,291
unhappy? You know, something
like that. But I think that

818
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,731
your, your

819
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:35,202
story is going to ring true with
a lot of developers. Um, you

820
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:39,717
know, the, the, this, the, that
feeling of. Satisfaction.

821
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:41,176
Mike: there's pinpointed the
exact phrase, which made me

822
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,541
never

823
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,891
want to talk out about being
unhappy and tech as well,

824
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,241
because

825
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:49,112
we're a really well compensated
field. Like you tell people that

826
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,891
you own, like, this is how much
money you earn. Like starting.

827
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:54,947
Most people are like, oh, I just
want to do that job. And very

828
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,972
few

829
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:59,936
people maybe talk about, oh,
actually, There's a very unhappy

830
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:01,061
side to this where you are
sitting inside all day, typing

831
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:02,186
at

832
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,766
a keyboard or planning out a
database and it could all go

833
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:09,867
horribly wrong. And that feeling
is like, well, you could, yeah.

834
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:14,306
That tiny mistake, you know, is
there could just balloon into a

835
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,577
monster. And if you don't deal
with it, it's going to be

836
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,286
embarrassing. And people will
almost look at your work and

837
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:20,995
your

838
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:23,396
work always has your name next
to it as well. That's something

839
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:24,686
we've done as an industry.

840
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:25,681
Dan: Forever.

841
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:28,947
Mike: away from this. Yeah. Like
I've picked up code and I went,

842
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,401
who wrote this? And then I'm
like, oh, it's that guy. Okay.

843
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,855
He

844
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,211
pops up everywhere and it's
like, oh, that's an interesting

845
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:36,566
one. Or

846
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,416
it's like, oh wait, no, it was
me. I'm the bad guy in, in my

847
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,336
story. Uh, Yeah. And it's, it's
difficult to talk to people

848
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,256
about

849
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,912
this cause it's, we're in a
different world and this is why

850
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,567
I

851
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,447
really like having a few really
close developer friends who are

852
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:54,266
like, we're all kind of in the
same bubble. We know like how,

853
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,777
how it goes in terms of, Okay.
Yeah. You do have days where you

854
00:36:57,777 --> 00:37:01,106
are just sitting at a computer
screen, looking at a black

855
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:05,172
terminal. And you'll just say, I
can't figure this out. I have.

856
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,316
And you Google the question and
like one guy, one person on

857
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:09,430
stack

858
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:14,021
overflow has asked to, and it's
like no answers. And it's like,

859
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,702
uh, how obscure is this? What am
I doing wrong? Sorry.

860
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:20,862
Bekah: Or I feel like the worst
is when you get that, but then

861
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:23,112
they respond to their posts and
they're like, I got it.

862
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:25,751
Nevermind. I'm like, well, can

863
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:31,032
Mike: Should I be what you did,
what did you do to solve it? Uh,

864
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:33,731
but has anyone come back and
found their old posts from when

865
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,366
they Regina to go correct them
or add more information, but

866
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:37,001
we're

867
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:37,452
just me.

868
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,871
Bekah: There's no way I would
ever do That

869
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:42,181
Mike: Aye. Aye.

870
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:44,641
Bekah: of where I was at that
point in my life. And I'm going

871
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,411
to just go with that.

872
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,646
Mike: I changed my username
online at some point, just to

873
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,251
not

874
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,786
fight any someone, a VC found my
OGs name, um, because I'd

875
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,321
written

876
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,961
a comment like being like nice.
And they're like, wait, hold on.

877
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:02,222
This is the same writing style
as that person. And that name is

878
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:07,572
very familiar and they figured
out it was me from like, Well,

879
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,331
yeah, two years ago solving That
problem and they sent me a thank

880
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,731
you. And I'm like, I need to go
back and work for more of these

881
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:15,101
places. Now it's the, we've got
some good detectives in the

882
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:17,471
crowd

883
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,762
who he know my old user name.

884
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:24,972
Dan: That that's pretty funny.
I, I, um, yeah, going back and

885
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,762
that's an interesting idea of
just going back and updating,

886
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:29,961
answering your own questions,
you know, uh, back in the day,

887
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:31,571
this

888
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:34,422
is what I did. I promise. I
wouldn't probably remember, you

889
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:35,501
know, any of the answers

890
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:37,911
Mike: Yeah, but you might be
able to figure it out, like go

891
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,725
back

892
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,637
and be like, this is prob this
is what I was asking. I think I

893
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:46,126
vaguely remember. What that
question could be, or at least

894
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:47,701
you can put it in the right
place or maybe archive the

895
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,276
question if

896
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:50,697
you were like, no, this is
garbage. I need to hide this

897
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,117
from

898
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:54,322
the world or something like
that, but it gets, it comes back

899
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:56,527
to the

900
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,777
garden again. It's like, you
know, putting up the bits in the

901
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:02,646
back, which you don't often tend
to, or like getting rid of the

902
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:05,407
bad information. Maybe if you
put out some old comments,

903
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:10,492
Dan: Right or change your use
name? Maybe just throw a tarp

904
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:12,061
Mike: no, they'll, they'll
protest

905
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:12,652
Dan: somewhere else.

906
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:15,601
Mike: every few years to start a
fresh this,

907
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:18,561
Dan: Right? Buy a new plot of
land.

908
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,041
Mike: yeah, I'm going to be Mike
Rodriguez. I think it's the it's

909
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:27,061
completely changed. My name grow
miss big, big bushy mustache,

910
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,652
like shave my mustache.

911
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:36,298
Dan: So you. Um, I, I found it
really cool and impressive, uh,

912
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,048
your process for when you sorry
we keep we keep going back to

913
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:42,133
that moment, but at that moment,
um, where you made that list,

914
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,218
um,

915
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,039
and, you know, found some stuff
that worked for you that wasn't

916
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,839
like, That wasn't like, I know
you started applying for jobs

917
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,639
and

918
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,248
stuff too, but the list of side
things like side projects or, or

919
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:57,119
other things like that. Um, and
so I guess my question with that

920
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,338
was, um, do, now that you were
in, um, maybe a more stable

921
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:03,868
situation, you know, how have
you found yourself? And I think

922
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,398
the

923
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,418
answer is yes, but like, have
you found yourself keeping up

924
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:07,438
with

925
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,133
those things that you did mostly
to get yourself moving again?

926
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,828
You

927
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,528
know, and, um, and I was
wondering if you could talk a

928
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:14,338
little bit about that.

929
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,199
Mike: absolutely. So this is, I
guess the other part of this,

930
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:20,684
where. When you're searching for
a job or trying to make a big

931
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:23,503
change, it's really easy to like
go out, like again, back to the

932
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:25,963
garden. Like, you know, when you
want to make it pretty, it's

933
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:26,893
like, it's easy to put the
effort in for a few weeks and

934
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:27,823
then

935
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:30,043
you've got a pretty garden, but
actually you need to maintain it

936
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,893
over a long period of time and
you can't go in with like

937
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:36,583
absolute, full force, full time
to make that garden pretty. You

938
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,873
have to do like come up with a
reason. So I've, I mean, I'm

939
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:44,713
still really bad at keeping up
to date with like keeping things

940
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,543
going out. But what I do is I
set myself a goal of like one

941
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,373
post a

942
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:50,698
month, one video a month. So,
which I think is very

943
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,023
achievable.

944
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,693
It's not, not too much work.
It's a very steady flow. And I

945
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,303
just

946
00:40:58,304 --> 00:40:59,504
say, right, that's what I'm
going to aim for. It's I'm going

947
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,704
to

948
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:04,574
keep putting things out and
that's going to be what I do

949
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,808
like, and I've managed to do
that pretty well. So. And even

950
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:09,013
if it's

951
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:13,634
not like a really well thought
out thing, like if I've got

952
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,013
something on my mind, I just
want to write about it, or I

953
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:16,392
want to

954
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,673
make a video on something. Cause
I know I've seen people

955
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:20,683
struggling. It will happen. And
then also on the lists as well,

956
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:22,693
I

957
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:26,833
am the worst and the best. And
the greatest. There you go. I'm

958
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,318
the greatest for making lists,
sorry. I'm not the worst. I'm

959
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:29,803
the

960
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:33,534
best. Sorry. Completely wrong
time. I love making lists. Lists

961
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:36,693
are like I've got, I use the
Reminders app in apple where you

962
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:40,563
can have lots of little lists
broken out to categories. And I

963
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:43,903
have, I always go through them.
Curate them as well. So at the

964
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:45,163
end of the month, I remove
stuff, which actually I'm not

965
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:46,423
that

966
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,523
interested in doing anymore. And
then throughout the month they

967
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:50,413
keep adding stuff in. So I've
got a big list of blog posts. I

968
00:41:50,413 --> 00:41:52,303
want

969
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:55,454
to write. I've got the titles
done and I've got like a link to

970
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:58,514
where I think I could take them.
Same with videos. Same with like

971
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:00,693
little things I need to do. Um,
And that has that's helped a

972
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,832
lot.

973
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,353
I, I realized I'm a very list
oriented person. Like I think

974
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:08,534
it's agile methodologies have
like ruined me. I was like

975
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:10,093
working in like, you know,
having a startup every morning.

976
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,652
I almost

977
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,623
like if I had a pet cat, me and
the cat would have a start up

978
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:17,233
every morning about what we're
going to achieve that day. And

979
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:21,583
I'll do the voice of the cat,
obviously. Um, you guys won't

980
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,804
know the accent. I give it, but
every day it would be slightly

981
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:25,588
different. Like I'm just
imagining that the cat is

982
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:27,372
snarky.

983
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:29,923
Uh, you can, you're gonna write
a blog post. You did that nice

984
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,078
one.

985
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:36,364
Bekah: I would like a whole
series of that.

986
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:40,304
Dan: Yeah. That's uh, the new,
the new Mike Rogers video series

987
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,758
is conversations with the cat.
We just need to, we just need to

988
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,212
get

989
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:44,204
you a cat first and then

990
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,818
Mike: It could happen soon
enough. That's there's some

991
00:42:46,818 --> 00:42:48,949
floating around outside. Maybe
others feed some.

992
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,149
Dan: yeah. I mean, that's true.
Cats'll, cats'll learning. If

993
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,364
you

994
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,753
start feeding them, they'll
they'll learn my, um, Emily's my

995
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:58,265
wife's grandma. Uh, feeds cats
in our yard to cause they killed

996
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:00,777
the

997
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,548
chipmunks and squirrels, you
know, it's because she wants

998
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:02,318
them

999
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,768
to come, but they'll come like
they'll, they'll learn here.

1000
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:06,918
They'll learn your routine and
stuff. So he could just have a

1001
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:09,509
little stand up with the cat
under stoop, you know, every,

1002
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:13,039
every morning I would watch
that.

1003
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,869
Mike: I, yeah, I think we just
hit my new video series. Right.

1004
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,228
It's like, this is what we're
going to do today. Cut. Like,

1005
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:21,869
almost like, was it pinky in the
brain? What are you going to do

1006
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,139
today? Pinky or brain. Oh, I'm
going to take over the world.

1007
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,369
Yeah.

1008
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,893
Bekah: but by Joe. So, you know,
one of the things like talking

1009
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:36,403
through all of them, Has been
really fascinating. And I'm like

1010
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,853
amazed by how many people that
I've talked to that have talked

1011
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:44,164
about how much they love their
job. And then suddenly realized

1012
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,454
that they hate their job. Like.

1013
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:48,048
Mike: I'm suspicious of people
who say they love, love their

1014
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:49,622
job

1015
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:52,474
on the site. I don't think you
do. I think you're just saying

1016
00:43:52,474 --> 00:43:52,804
that,

1017
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,329
Bekah: I think it's a lot of
times like putting your hand in

1018
00:43:57,329 --> 00:43:59,969
warm water and then slowly
boiling boiling it or frog, I

1019
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:00,449
guess you don't

1020
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:01,889
Mike: Yeah. That's I know the

1021
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:02,938
Bekah: it with a frog either,
but

1022
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:05,259
Mike: Yeah.

1023
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:09,664
Bekah: You increase it, the
temperature and don't realize it

1024
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:12,603
because it's just like this
slow, um, process until like

1025
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:15,542
suddenly

1026
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,063
you're boiling. And then I think
at that point you're like, oh,

1027
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:22,184
Maybe, maybe I don't love this.
Maybe I did love this at one

1028
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:26,474
point, but all of these things
are keep changing and I just

1029
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:30,793
missed it or kept thinking that
it will get better and it just

1030
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,713
keeps getting worse, you know?
And then we don't talk about

1031
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,633
that

1032
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:35,939
kind of stuff enough. And I
think part of it, like you said,

1033
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,244
we

1034
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:41,083
make a lot of money in tech and
you can make a lot of money and

1035
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,414
not be happy. It's okay. To not
love to code, but there's a

1036
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:50,333
difference between not loving to
code and really being unhappy

1037
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,884
because it bleeds out into all
the other aspects of your life.

1038
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:56,453
Mike: Exactly. Like if, Yeah. I
feel like unhappy at work and

1039
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:58,477
you

1040
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,143
can't quite identify, like
what's what the cause is. Or

1041
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,808
like you're

1042
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,438
unhappy outside of work and
you've got to bring it in. Like

1043
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:07,028
it just kind of, it slows you
down in the other places and

1044
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:10,963
you've got to like really. Find
the good bits. And this is why

1045
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:12,298
I'm also suspicious of people
who say they've really loved

1046
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:13,633
their

1047
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:15,493
job. Um, sorry. I'm like, like
mumbling next to it. So I'm

1048
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,352
like,

1049
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,584
we aren't allowed to say we
don't like our job. It's none of

1050
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:19,784
that.

1051
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:23,523
It's like, no, she don't tell
people. You hate certain things

1052
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:26,284
about work. It's never going to
change. You've got to like,

1053
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,063
you've got to almost go out to
your manager or be the, be the

1054
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:35,278
change you want to see in the
office. So if you want to. Do

1055
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,498
certain processes to stop doing
them and then see if anyone will

1056
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:41,203
fight you on like, not doing
them and to see what happens

1057
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:42,747
like

1058
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:45,748
worst case scenario. You have a
fun argument with someone and

1059
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:49,079
you'll be able to find out the
benefits of something or maybe

1060
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,009
not right.

1061
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,518
Dan: I love it. I, this actually
that goes right into a question

1062
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:53,913
I

1063
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:56,373
was going to ask was, um, you
mentioned when you were talking

1064
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:58,943
about, um, So your freelancing
experience, you know, before,

1065
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:01,513
and

1066
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:05,353
it's sort of, you said it as an
aside, but you said he sometimes

1067
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:06,673
have problems with authority
and, you know, it had been one

1068
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:07,962
of the

1069
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:09,778
reasons why you had stuck with
the freelancing for so long.

1070
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:11,593
And,

1071
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:14,414
um, I was, my question was
basically just like I was

1072
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,813
wondering you now we're working
for sort of a larger

1073
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:20,554
organization. I was just
wondering, um, how that is. You

1074
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:23,134
know, vis-a-vis like authority
and having bosses and, and

1075
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:25,534
probably different tiers of
managers, but I'm not really

1076
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:26,869
sure, but you know, that sort of
thing. I was wondering if, uh,

1077
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,204
if

1078
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:28,434
that has

1079
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:28,893
Mike: It's so

1080
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:29,643
Dan: any effect on you.

1081
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:34,094
Mike: It's so different. I find
it almost comical every time I

1082
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:38,623
have to like fill out some kind
of form and I always make sure,

1083
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:43,273
like, I tell people that this is
a stupid form or like, Hey, this

1084
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:46,423
is a waste of time. Like we've
just spent like three hours

1085
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:51,059
planning for something like.
Yeah, well, it surprises me. So

1086
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,058
the companies you have meetings
about when you're going to have

1087
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:52,977
a

1088
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,003
meeting about something more
frequently than you expect,

1089
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,028
like,

1090
00:46:57,268 --> 00:46:59,579
I feel like when I was a
freelancer, that was like, they

1091
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,009
would never bring a freelancer
into that kind of eating that is

1092
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:02,983
like, this is what we're going
to get the freelancer to do.

1093
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:03,957
Cool.

1094
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,389
All right. We'll just give them
the work or give them the work

1095
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:12,048
even. Um, yeah, I'm still. Still
terrible with authority figures

1096
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,239
where it's like someone tells me
to do something and I'm just

1097
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,869
like, come on, you're going to
do it. If I want to do it, that,

1098
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:18,919
manage that to figure out how
you're going to motivate me to

1099
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,969
do

1100
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:20,568
this

1101
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,364
Dan: I love that. I I, I,

1102
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,039
Mike: send money.

1103
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:35,284
Dan: yeah, I've been a
freelancer, you know, my whole

1104
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:39,764
career and that's that. Um, one
of the reasons why I've almost

1105
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:40,708
never really, I mean, there's
only been a couple of times

1106
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:41,652
where

1107
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,693
I've really considered, you
know, switching, uh, to say some

1108
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,733
sort

1109
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:49,684
of full-time job that the, um, I
think about the meetings and

1110
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:50,968
especially if being a freelance
or not being in those meetings

1111
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,123
is

1112
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:53,878
actually like, can be really
frustrating too. Um, I found,

1113
00:47:53,878 --> 00:47:55,633
you

1114
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:59,083
know, the, somebody just gives
you the work, but you don't have

1115
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:02,773
any connection to. The inception
of the work, you know, or like

1116
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,864
probably you might actually have
a better idea then there's, you

1117
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:10,543
know, uh, I feel like that's
maybe a, a pro for getting more

1118
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,013
involved in a, in a company, you
know, at, at a high level kind

1119
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:13,483
of

1120
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:13,753
thing.

1121
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:18,219
Mike: Yeah. I think I've
definitely had work come in

1122
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,679
around. I'm like, why don't we
just do the simple way? And then

1123
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:22,628
I reply back and then they're
like, oh, we didn't know about

1124
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:25,088
that. I mean, this had like, we
just wasted hours planning this

1125
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:27,699
workout for you. And it's like,
cool. So we'll just do the easy

1126
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:31,148
way then. Nice cool and those
still get paid like the same

1127
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:34,639
amount. Cause that was going to
take weeks. Um,

1128
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,923
Bekah: Uh, it should be like a
bonus for those situations.

1129
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,599
Mike: Uh, it's, that's not how
freelancing ever has worked.

1130
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:45,583
Dan: Yeah, no, that's not. Yeah,
that's it. I mean, the bonus is

1131
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,338
that they trust you more and
they keeping paying for your

1132
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,093
work. I

1133
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,564
mean, that's, that's like,
that's the bonus, I suppose, as

1134
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:52,034
a

1135
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:57,403
freelancer, you know? Um, but
also personally, Doing things

1136
00:48:57,403 --> 00:49:01,273
that are stupid too. Like I've
never been, I've never been, I

1137
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:02,368
know some people where, you
know, you get that same thing.

1138
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:03,463
You're

1139
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:04,423
like, I know that there's an
easy way to do this. That would

1140
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:05,383
take

1141
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:08,054
me an hour. And the way they've
asked me will take two weeks or

1142
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:10,798
something, you know? And, uh, I
could just let it ride, you

1143
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:13,542
know,

1144
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,034
but I would be miserable for
those two weeks, you know? And

1145
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:18,373
I'm like, let's just do the easy
way. That'd be, that'd be fine.

1146
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:18,733
That'd be

1147
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,184
Mike: Yeah, this is, this is why
I always, I think this is also

1148
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:25,034
one of the things which has made
me a happier person. I always

1149
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:28,213
like kind of pushing back on
everything where I can, or at

1150
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:31,443
least trying to be a bit yeah.
Like confrontational, because

1151
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,324
other you're going to be doing
that miserable work all day. And

1152
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:36,423
it's like, there's no point
during the miserable work. Cause

1153
00:49:36,454 --> 00:49:39,213
like, it's just going to get
deleted the week after when

1154
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:42,994
someone decides they want to do
it the easy way. And you just

1155
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:45,873
kind of wasting your time and
your time is so precious. Like

1156
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:50,009
I'm not sure. That anyone
listening to this, but like, I

1157
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:51,673
I'm, I'm I feel young Right.
now, but I'm also scared that

1158
00:49:51,673 --> 00:49:53,278
soon I'm

1159
00:49:53,278 --> 00:49:55,138
going to wake up and be this
like crazy. Like my life's gone

1160
00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:56,998
of

1161
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:58,723
like the best years have passed
or something. And I don't want

1162
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:00,448
to

1163
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:03,719
spend it like trying to solve
some stupid problem. Like when

1164
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,294
there's an easy way to do it, I
to, I want to be out playing

1165
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,869
golf

1166
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:09,748
or like doing something more
interesting.

1167
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,259
Dan: Tending tending your
garden, right?

1168
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,344
Mike: Tending to my garden.
Yeah. that was,

1169
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,164
Bekah: Brushing his garden.

1170
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:15,898
Dan: Brushing the soil.

1171
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:21,003
Mike: but yeah. Thinking about
that now, I think I'm in raking

1172
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:21,724
the soils.

1173
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:22,034
Bekah: Yeah.

1174
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:22,858
Dan: Yeah. That's that's

1175
00:50:23,193 --> 00:50:24,184
Mike: that was a hundred
percent.

1176
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:24,748
Dan: That makes sense.

1177
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:29,224
Mike: It took me 20 minutes to
figure That out. I'm glad we had

1178
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:30,094
a meeting about that.

1179
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:37,469
Dan: right? Yeah. Oh man. It's
amazing. I still do love that

1180
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,878
metaphor though. I'm going to be
thinking about it.

1181
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,098
Mike: I'm I feel like I want to
get like, like have you seen

1182
00:50:42,098 --> 00:50:43,778
when

1183
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:48,969
people have like live loss live
or life, so throw those out

1184
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:51,909
because those are terrible, but
change it if like, you know,

1185
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,648
garden your career or your
career is a garden and brush it.

1186
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:07,469
Dan: Okay. Brush that dirt.

1187
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:11,009
Bekah: I think we have a code of
conduct. Okay.

1188
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:12,358
Dan: I

1189
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:17,353
Mike: Like Icarus right now.
It's like 10.

1190
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:22,048
Dan: Oh man. That's amazing.

1191
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:23,248
Mike: Okay.

1192
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:26,218
Dan: Yeah, I'm going to make
that sign for sure. I can't,

1193
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:28,482
every

1194
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:30,498
Bekah: That's going to be a
sticker. We need

1195
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:32,893
Dan: tell him, don't tell me,
don't tell me what to do. Sign.

1196
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:41,458
Mike: My manager, but not, I
don't listen to you so like you

1197
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,388
might manage it, but I'm
ignoring you because you're

1198
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:43,318
wrong.

1199
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:45,088
Bekah: Okay.

1200
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:49,034
Mike: in management. You're not
a developer. Sorry.

1201
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:52,744
Bekah: hot takes.

1202
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:53,713
Mike: Spicy.

1203
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:55,663
Dan: Well, you, you had that
lot. What was it? Uh, oh, good

1204
00:51:55,663 --> 00:51:57,252
luck.

1205
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,244
Good luck managing me or

1206
00:51:58,403 --> 00:51:58,523
Bekah: Okay.

1207
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,204
Dan: good luck motivated me to
do that.

1208
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:06,123
Mike: Yes. That is what I want
on my laptop.

1209
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,989
Bekah: Like, I, I we're like
almost at time and I really want

1210
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:15,148
to dive into that idea of
motivation a little bit more

1211
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:16,798
because something that I've been
interested in, and you're

1212
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:18,448
talking

1213
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:21,088
about this competition that you
have with your friend. And so,

1214
00:52:21,088 --> 00:52:25,648
like, obviously that's a good
motivator, but I think, I, I

1215
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:28,079
don't know if we have time to
talk about this. So maybe just

1216
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,219
some, a

1217
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:29,918
Mike: should've been so quick.

1218
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:34,063
Bekah: On how to motivate people
and keep them from stagnation.

1219
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:35,324
Right? Cause that's part of it.

1220
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:38,054
Mike: Yeah. So I've got like
one, one quick tick and it's

1221
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,929
like, so

1222
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:45,193
I have a podcast. I listen to
where. It's like a meditation

1223
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:47,113
podcast and that has been so
wonderful. Um, I talk about it

1224
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:49,033
in

1225
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:52,123
VC, quite a lot of things called
meditation minis. They're 10

1226
00:52:52,123 --> 00:52:55,514
minutes. They come out like once
a week and they are just a

1227
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:58,478
wonderful way of just like
before bed. I sit down and I was

1228
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:01,442
very

1229
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:04,143
skeptical when I first tried it,
but something about the sitting

1230
00:53:04,143 --> 00:53:07,503
down, down and relaxing for 10
minutes before bed has helped me

1231
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:11,309
enormously. I think there's
getting a better night's sleep

1232
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,849
and having good sleep hygiene as
well. So I feel better, like I

1233
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:16,109
don't work till like three in
the morning or four in the

1234
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,369
morning

1235
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:22,068
and wake up at 7 AM and then
like rec my, uh, rec my sleep.

1236
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:25,724
Which has been good. And I also
really recommend everyone. If

1237
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,514
you're not feeling great, talk
to a therapist, it's like, it's

1238
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:29,818
super easy. Now. There's like,
there's apps to do it. It's

1239
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:31,122
like,

1240
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:33,118
you don't have to kind of go to
a place and tap them in person.

1241
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:35,083
You

1242
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:38,143
could talk to someone this via
WhatsApp, and then they'll just

1243
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:40,863
do the things and then you'll
be, you might feel better. Yeah.

1244
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,482
The

1245
00:53:43,483 --> 00:53:46,634
reason. I also say therapist, as
well as when someone explained

1246
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:48,704
the concept of therapy, I was
like, that sounds, that sounds

1247
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:51,043
weird. But then they're like,
they said to me, okay, so your

1248
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:53,864
parents, no one told them how to
raise you. They figured it out

1249
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:59,083
and they screwed up everything
probably. So, so a therapist is

1250
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,744
like, they iron out the bits,
your parents, like didn't like

1251
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:03,728
give you the tools to like solve
in life. So like how to deal

1252
00:54:03,728 --> 00:54:05,712
with

1253
00:54:05,983 --> 00:54:09,643
like, being really unhappy or
they'll give you some techniques

1254
00:54:09,643 --> 00:54:11,704
to deal with it. Or if you're
feeling anxious, they.

1255
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:15,239
Approaches, which no one tells
you about until you pay them the

1256
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:16,679
money. And it's like a hundred
bucks and they'll pay, Okay.

1257
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:18,119
Here

1258
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:19,824
is the secret to like getting
rid of anxiety. If you're

1259
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,509
feeling

1260
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,354
anxious about something. And
then also, Yeah. a bit of

1261
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:25,199
healthy

1262
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,014
competition. Like I always, I
love to show off and like, I

1263
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,829
love

1264
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:32,068
to be competitive with my
friends. So like we always send

1265
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,858
each other what we're up to and
try and get feedback. And

1266
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,148
sometimes we are brutally honest
with each other saying, this is

1267
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,438
a

1268
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:40,588
terrible idea. You're going to
waste all your money here. And

1269
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:42,298
then other times it's like,
they're like, no, this is an

1270
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:44,623
interesting idea. You should,
you should give it a go. Um, a

1271
00:54:44,623 --> 00:54:46,948
really

1272
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,458
good example of me being
completely wrong. Um, one of my

1273
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,639
friends showed me this app ID
had where it was people watching

1274
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,663
YouTube videos together, and
this was pre pandemic. And, you

1275
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:57,687
know,

1276
00:54:57,688 --> 00:54:59,909
being able to write notes around
them and then have a bit of a

1277
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:02,278
conversation afterwards. And I
was like, That's. a stupid idea.

1278
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:03,298
That'll never take off.

1279
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:03,579
Bekah: Okay.

1280
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,204
Mike: Um, I found a app
recently, which had raised tons

1281
00:55:06,204 --> 00:55:08,039
of money to

1282
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,793
do just that. And it was a
really good app. And I was like,

1283
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:11,547
we were

1284
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,458
watching, I think it was a Sandy
med store together with a bunch

1285
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,648
of other developers. And I was
like, this is perfect. This is

1286
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:19,469
what I like. And I really regret
not like encouraging my friend

1287
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,619
now because really regret it
because he couldn't get a

1288
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,759
millionaire. I think.

1289
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:29,226
Dan: That's. Yeah, that's one of
those weird things that like the

1290
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:31,280
pandemic, I feel like, uh, it,
it doesn't sound like a good

1291
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,334
idea.

1292
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:35,496
It didn't sound like a good idea
to me either that, that sort of

1293
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:38,226
thing. Cause you know, and then,
well now we can't actually be in

1294
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:40,585
the same room together. So, so
like,

1295
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,955
Mike: perfect. I love it. I hate
being in the same room as

1296
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:43,050
people,

1297
00:55:43,396 --> 00:55:44,815
Dan: yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1298
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,871
Mike: No, I'm just kidding.

1299
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:48,545
Bekah: has been.

1300
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,681
Mike: Yeah. It's been fantastic

1301
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:55,295
Bekah: Really good podcast
episode. So thank you

1302
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,451
Mike: to wrap up before I talk
for another two hours and we

1303
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,180
ended up having some mega
session and it's like, the list

1304
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,850
is like,

1305
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,410
I think maybe we'll save like
another topic for another

1306
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,040

1307
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:15,306
season or something. I hope. Um,
yeah, if I could go out and like

1308
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:17,885
one final thing Is Yeah,
obviously we talked about, if

1309
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:21,606
you're feeling like stagnant in
your career, just talk, talk to

1310
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:24,516
people, even if it's a private
one, you will feel better for

1311
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:27,936
that. And we've all gone through
this. We all feel sad. So this

1312
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:31,085
just talk, it's tell people, ask
for help. You'll feel better for

1313
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:31,206
it.
