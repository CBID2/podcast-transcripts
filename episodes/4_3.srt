00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,410
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season four, episode three of

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,239
the

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,690
Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah, and this is a podcast

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,140
that

5
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:17,861
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,181
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

7
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,501
their

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,260
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,625
stories and what they've
learned. And we are here to

10
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,990
share it with

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,591
you. Here with me today is my
cohost Dan.

12
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,959
Dan: Thanks Bekah! This week, we
got the chance to sit down with

13
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,653
Jennifer Konikowski. Jennifer
has been a software engineer for

14
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:36,347
over

15
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,168
10 years and has worked with a
million different languages and

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,319
helped found and organize
PyLadies Boston and Boston Ruby

17
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,308
Women. She's currently a senior
engineer at Splice. We had a

18
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,009
great time chatting with
Jennifer. She talked about her

19
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,449
experiences building
communities, how she approached

20
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:51,889
navigating

21
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:54,859
different workplaces through her
career. And she shared some hot

22
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,569
takes to get us through the
week. I had a great time talking

23
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,279
with

24
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,048
Jennifer and I know you're going
to enjoy it.

25
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,201
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we start every

26
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,531
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

27
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,586
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

28
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:17,641
Today's

29
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:23,742
question is which vegetable is
best with cheese. We hope you

30
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:26,261
enjoy this episode. Hi, I'm
Bekah. I am a front end

31
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,780
developer

32
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:34,996
from a small town in Ohio. The
best vegetable with cheese is

33
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:38,326
most definitely broccoli.
There's no other right answer.

34
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,686
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan. I'm a
front end developer from

35
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,251
Cleveland,

36
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:49,371
Ohio, and yeah, I don't, this
question is bizarre. Uh, I

37
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,980
don't,

38
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,831
uh, I don't really like broccoli
with cheese. Like I prefer

39
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,981
broccoli, just like, you know,
without cheese. If I had the

40
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,852
option between the two, um, I
would choose no cheese. Uh,

41
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,277
Bekah: rice broccoli casserole
Okay

42
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:06,796
Dan: Is potato a vegetable.

43
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:09,287
Bekah: Yes,

44
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,331
Jennifer: going to be my
question

45
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,437
Dan: I don't know if it is or
not. That's going to be my

46
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,247
answer

47
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,086
for sure. If

48
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,887
Bekah: root vegetable root
vegetable

49
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:20,657
Dan: I'll I'm stealing potato.
That's my that's my answer

50
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,222
Jennifer: Hi, I'm Jennifer. I am
a senior backend software

51
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:32,642
engineer at splice, um, out of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And

52
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:36,062
I'm

53
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:39,271
also like if potatoes are
considered a vegetable, I guess

54
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:44,521
potatoes, you know, who doesn't
love some poutine, cheesy fries,

55
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:45,951
you know?

56
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:46,801
Dan: Yeah

57
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,106
Bekah: is a good call. I was
thinking just putting it on your

58
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,097
mashed potatoes

59
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,116
Jennifer: No, I don't. If
potatoes aren't Fried I

60
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,526
generally

61
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:56,217
don't eat them.

62
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,716
Dan: I think mashed potatoes,
but again, without cheese, but

63
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,351
like

64
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:04,021
there's a lot of fried
situations that I think cheese.

65
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,801
Bekah: like mashed potatoes with
cheese and bacon and why I know

66
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,396
a

67
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,266
Greek yogurt

68
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,201
Dan: Like a big potato cheese.

69
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,231
Bekah: Yes Um oh welcome
Jennifer Thank you so much for

70
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,045
being here

71
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:23,467
and tolerating my strange
question for our intro.

72
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:26,497
Jennifer: I had to miss Virtual
Coffee this week. So to be

73
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,747
honest, you know, this is, this
is my comeuppance.

74
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:29,646
Bekah: Oh yeah

75
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,401
Jennifer: I had to get at least
one weird question this week to

76
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:32,882
answer.

77
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,041
Bekah: Well Tuesday Tuesday was
all kinds of weirdness And at

78
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,450
the

79
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:39,211
beginning we won't go there
because it got a little dark but

80
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,342
we're glad to have you here with
us today and we always like to

81
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:47,461
get started with your origin
story. So can you tell us a

82
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,662
little bit about how you got to
this point

83
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:58,072
Jennifer: Oh boy. Um, I, so I
grew up in Alabama. I wanted to

84
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:02,582
leave Alabama. And at the time,
my best bet to decide to start

85
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:06,692
as

86
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:12,301
a biomedical engineer at Georgia
Tech. Um, after I was like, I

87
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:16,802
don't want to do that switched a
couple of times, ended on

88
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,036
industrial engineering, uh,
really enjoyed that actually

89
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,270
I've

90
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,507
in statistics and operations
research. Super fun. Through

91
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:29,956
that, um, Georgia Tech actually
makes all their students take at

92
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:35,057
least one computing class. had
two extra as part of my program.

93
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,906
Um, I think that ended up
putting me in a good position

94
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,976
because

95
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:45,016
when I was graduating, I didn't
have the highest GPA. So I was

96
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,656
going in the career fair to like
all the companies that had

97
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,951
shorter lines that like weren't
as cool. And I ended up getting

98
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,246
a

99
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,706
job at Home Depot as a. Oh,
shoot. What was the, it's a

100
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:57,165
weird

101
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:01,786
job title IT developer. what it
was. It was pretty similar to a

102
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:08,177
project management position. And
from there I had thought I would

103
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:11,386
be doing more development per
the job title, and there were a

104
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:14,595
few

105
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,664
things that for me, I actually
overall I think had a pretty

106
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,732
good

107
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:25,201
experience with Home Depot as a
company, but my particular team

108
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,466
was a bit of a disaster, which I
think is sort of a theme my

109
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,731
whole

110
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:34,831
career. And at a certain point
of like, know, it's look at the

111
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:38,581
common denominator. I'm like, oh
crap. it is me. Hopefully not

112
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:45,232
though. Um, I think I'm just
really bad at where to work. I

113
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,637
swear, Splice is great.

114
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:48,396
Bekah: So far so good.

115
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:56,206
Jennifer: Yeah, so, so good. Um,
so I changed jobs. I joined the

116
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,366
deliverability team at MailChimp
for a couple of years, and then

117
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:00,526
I

118
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,867
moved up to Boston. And at that
point, um, obviously with a job

119
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:12,047
in email delivery, there's not
that many. It's hard to find

120
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:17,117
another place where you can do
that. Uh, without against an

121
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:22,966
actual non-compete, uh, in
dealing with trade secrets. So I

122
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,396
was like, okay, I definitely
can't go get a job at Constant

123
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,646
Contact. Cause there's no way
MailChimp wouldn't go after me.

124
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,896
I

125
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,501
learned, I learned some Python,
so I'm like, I guess now I can

126
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,106
be

127
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:36,887
a developer and. I, this was,

128
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:37,706
Dan: Yeah.

129
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:40,516
Jennifer: was back when this
was, uh, October, 2012. So

130
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:43,246
mostly pre

131
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,736
boot camps. So caveat, this is,
I feel like an origin story that

132
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,225
is

133
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:51,301
really hard to come by these
days I got hired to be a warm

134
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:54,376
body, as

135
00:06:54,377 --> 00:07:00,396
a contractor, um, through like a
sort of third party TripAdvisor

136
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:08,692
and it got experience without
having to do almost anything in

137
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,187
the interview. And, you know,
from there, I worked at a

138
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,682
variety

139
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,367
of startups, in the Boston area.
Uh, I also worked at Occupy for

140
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:19,052
a

141
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:25,802
couple of years, uh, moved to
Pittsburgh uh, since then I

142
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,421
worked at Stitch Fix for a
couple of years, Testable for

143
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:29,011
one I've

144
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:35,372
been at Splice now two over two
weeks. For no, exactly. Two

145
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:35,752
months.

146
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:39,331
Bekah: That's...

147
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:43,471
Jennifer: oh, and I've mostly
done Ruby on Rails back in, but

148
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:48,961
as I'm sure a lot of this know,
uh, it's very hard to get away

149
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,641
from being full stack.

150
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:56,762
Bekah: I know. So you've done a
lot of work, I think throughout

151
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:01,697
that time. With community and
building community. And I think

152
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:05,927
looking at your thinking about
your origin story and of the

153
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:09,887
different steps of your journey
to get where you were, I love to

154
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,926
talk a little bit about like,
why you decided to start

155
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,965
PyLadies

156
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,127
when you were in Boston or like,
what was the thing that made you

157
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,906
think, like, I need to start
working to build community for

158
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,266
women and minorities and tech?

159
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:30,091
Jennifer: So, I mean, I think
mostly like, since I've started

160
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,961
in the workforce and had any
sort of power, I have personally

161
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:38,611
always felt the need to try and
bring people up with me. Um, and

162
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:41,686
I know, so when I was in
Atlanta, my friend, uh, Laura

163
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,761
had started

164
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:50,432
Atlanta and we were just like a
little study group of people

165
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:59,986
trying to learn Python and that
helped me much. And that I, that

166
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:05,267
when I moved to Boston, I wanted
to do that in Boston as well,

167
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,886
because I saw Boston has this
really great Boston Python

168
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,505
group.

169
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,527
They're wonderful. But at the
same time, the group is massive.

170
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:17,297
And I know for me, it was really
intimidating to go, especially

171
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,511
because it's all dudes. It
didn't matter that they were

172
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,725
generally

173
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,567
like extremely kind and
welcoming. you go in a room with

174
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:29,057
like 200 people and there's
maybe. You know, 10 women, you

175
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,471
know, I've, even if I'm, even if
I'm generous, let's say 40 out

176
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,885
of

177
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:42,256
those 200, know, it still feels
very overwhelming. Um, so wanted

178
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:47,506
a safe for women to come and
learn Python, maybe just

179
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,566
experience it. And even though I
was a Ruby developer at the

180
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,955
time,

181
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:53,806
the reason I sort of chose
Python because as much as I love

182
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,325
Ruby,

183
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,787
the community is entirely
focused, pretty much on

184
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:04,576
applications and APIs great. I
love them. That's what I do. But

185
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,386
I find that Python has more
applications outside of being a

186
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,441
software developer, uh, data
scientists use Python,

187
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,496
academics,

188
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:19,481
use Python, There's I, I knew a
lot of linguists actually, who

189
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:24,491
were part of Boston. And I
thought that was cool. And if my

190
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,701
overall goal was to sort of,
part of my goal was to also more

191
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,911
women

192
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,696
how to code, not even
necessarily make them software

193
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,480
developers,

194
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:40,062
but to be like, Hey, is a thing
it's not actually that hard. you

195
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:44,221
can do it, you and it will help
you do your job faster and more

196
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:48,001
efficiently, and you don't have
to become a software developer.

197
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,091
You can learn this skill and it
can benefit you where you are.

198
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:55,052
Um, but obviously I also wanted
to help. If people were

199
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,016
interested in switch, I wanted
to do everything I could to

200
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,980
support

201
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:04,292
them in that. And so, and I was
also as a Ruby developer. Um, my

202
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,696
friend, uh, Melissa Z uh,
Boston, Ruby women. And I would

203
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:11,100
go to

204
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,601
that. I was one of the founding
members of that group and I

205
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,101
would

206
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,552
help organize that. And for both
of those groups, I would host

207
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:23,506
like weekly study sessions for
Boston review women. I. I'd be

208
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,616
like, oh, like I'm going to be
at this. Uh, I think it was, I,

209
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:27,726
I

210
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:31,126
went to area four in Kendall
Square and be like, I'm going to

211
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:34,996
be here from 12 to one during my
lunch break, come meet me. Like,

212
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,697
I'll answer any questions that I
can. I'll help you work through

213
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,277
things. I'll talk about job
applications. I'll review your

214
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:43,366
resume. Like literally whatever
you want. I'll be there. hanging

215
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,576
out here for you. then for
PyLadies, I'd do the same thing

216
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:49,421
on the weekend. I used to try to
do like some sort of class. And

217
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,266
I

218
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,937
found that it was really hard to
get people to stick with

219
00:11:54,937 --> 00:12:00,907
something at the same pace. So
having it be more open-ended I

220
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,527
think was better for everyone
because otherwise people would

221
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,147
be

222
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:08,297
like, oh, I couldn't make it to
this one. So now I'm out. Which

223
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:12,616
is the thing that I, I think
maybe if I had, if I made people

224
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,657
pay for it, they would've stuck
with it, but at the same time,

225
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:19,517
like I wanted this to be
accessible for everyone. And I

226
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:24,511
know. I know a lot of people who
have gone to bootcamps, and I

227
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,966
know a lot of great developers
out of bootcamps, but I feel

228
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,421
like

229
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:30,662
bootcamps are really expensive.
And one of the things that I saw

230
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:31,937
in Boston that I really didn't
like was that the bootcamps

231
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:33,182
were,

232
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:38,101
um, themselves as the only way
to get into tech and to switch

233
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:40,286
careers. And that. I really
didn't like that because a lot

234
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,471
of

235
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,371
people were switching careers
they were not in a good space

236
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,861
with their job and they did not,
they were not making that much

237
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,316
money. So to be like, oh, the
only way to switch is because

238
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,771
you

239
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,761
pay us $15,000. And I'm like,
no, like, mean, you can do that.

240
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,750
If

241
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:00,331
that's the best fit for you, you
know, maybe you need like the

242
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:04,922
extra accountability, the extra
classes. But I, one of my big

243
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:11,672
things I like the community be
able to be providing those

244
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,476
mentoring resources that people.
They get out of bootcamps. You

245
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,846
should not only be able to find
that in bootcamp, you should not

246
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:20,716
be able to only network. If you
went to a bootcamp, you you,

247
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,647
shouldn't be able to only like
learn in a group setting in a

248
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:28,157
bootcamp. Um, so I felt like as
a member of the community, like

249
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,667
I

250
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:35,484
wanted to do everything that I
could, build that up.

251
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,701
fortunately

252
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,061
Pittsburgh is a lot smaller, so
didn't really, I didn't really

253
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:45,421
do

254
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,001
the same thing in Pittsburgh
because at the time maybe I

255
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,580
would

256
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,692
now, but at the time we had Girl
Develop It and I felt like that

257
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:58,532
would, we weren't big enough to
really have like competing

258
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:05,672
women's development groups. of
course now girl develop it sort

259
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:12,392
of imploded, but I maybe I'll
revisit later. Cause it is

260
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,402
obviously a passion of mine.

261
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:18,576
Bekah: Yeah I mean, there are
Pittsburgh, surprisingly has a

262
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:22,537
lot of tech stuff already going
on, which is really nice to see.

263
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,746
And I think, you know, I want to
hit on this idea that you were

264
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,191
talking about having community
as part of the learning

265
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,636
experience.

266
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:37,177
I think one the things about
bootcamps that is tough is it

267
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:42,572
just kind of puts you in this
place where you only talk to the

268
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:47,581
people in your bootcamp. And so
it doesn't exactly mimic the

269
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:51,812
larger experience of what being
a developer is and communicating

270
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:55,711
with other people, all different
stages in, in what you're

271
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:59,610
working

272
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:04,922
on. Right? And so of have this
insulated experience, but if

273
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,532
you're working with a community
of people, or if you're

274
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:12,481
developing this open
conversation, allows you to

275
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,551
create, I think, good habits of
communication, maybe,or

276
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,621
something

277
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,111
that, that could really be one
of those things that allows you

278
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:21,601
to

279
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,751
be really successful in ways
that boot camps.

280
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:31,576
Dan: I, I, yeah, a lot of the
stuff you said. I was wondering

281
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,819
if you could tell me a little
bit more about like, so with

282
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:36,062
groups,

283
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,971
you did study groups, right? Um,
so open-ended study groups. Can

284
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,912
you, can you just like, me
through, like, what one, like

285
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:42,902
what, what one session, what,
what would happen, you know, at

286
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:43,892
a

287
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:47,402
study group? Um, you know, in
particular, like at once pick

288
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:47,611
one.

289
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:53,057
Jennifer: yeah, it would really
depend on who came. Uh, so like

290
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:58,126
one example is over a period of
weeks, this one woman, um,

291
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:02,866
regularly and was trying to find
a job. So part of what was

292
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:07,246
actually just encourage her and
tell her that, like I knew where

293
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:12,677
she was. So I'm like, I know you
have the skills to do this. Like

294
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:16,029
I think you should apply you
know, absolute worst thing is

295
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,381
get

296
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,871
rejected, but I think you have a
really good chance of getting

297
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,476
this job. You know, I helped her
review her resume and make it

298
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:25,081
pop

299
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:29,072
a little bit more. And emphasize
if she was coming from the

300
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,531
restaurant industry, it was
applying to a program. No, it

301
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,990
was

302
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:39,782
project manager position at a
tech company. Um, because that's

303
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:42,841
that was a particular position
that I felt like, that she was

304
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:46,412
interested in that would take
the skills she already had

305
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:51,871
professionally and could work
them into a much higher paying

306
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:56,286
And so that was one of the
things that would happen. But

307
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:58,831
then

308
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,831
sometimes people would come in
and be like, oh, I'm working

309
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:08,652
through. This section of this
tutorial, I don't understand for

310
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:13,201
loops and I would try to go
through it with them, give

311
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:20,221
examples, walk them through,
maybe like, cause sometimes I

312
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:21,736
think sometimes people need like
a number of different examples

313
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,251
or

314
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,672
to hear things a different way.
So maybe like the first thing I

315
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,861
say, like doesn't make sense I
used to be like, okay, let me

316
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,050
try

317
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,036
another thing. And, um, I, I
give sort of like another type

318
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,021
of

319
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,152
example of how it was supposed
to work.

320
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:39,846
Dan: totally.

321
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:43,142
Jennifer: eventually like
generally, eventually they get

322
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,431
it. And occasionally someone
would come with some sort of

323
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,720
like

324
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:50,071
pandas question I'm like, we can
try and struggle through this

325
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,412
together, but I don't know
pandas.

326
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:53,576
Dan: Yeah.

327
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:54,991
Jennifer: FYI.

328
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:58,067
Dan: That's I mean, that's, that
sounds really cool. And so like,

329
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:03,301
this was pre COVID or whatever.
Right. So, so like, would it be

330
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,102
people would just like, I'll
bring their laptops and sit

331
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:06,392
around a circle or, I mean, I'm
just trying to, because I'm

332
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:07,682
like,

333
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,196
I'm used to, like, you know,
I've been to a lot of meetups

334
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,710
that are

335
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,412
mostly just presentations and
hang, you know, social time

336
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:15,902
afterwards or whatever. And this
sounds a little bit more, you

337
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:18,422
know, a little different of a,
of an experience that I'm really

338
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:18,991
interested in.

339
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,332
Jennifer: So I feel like it was
similar to the size of like the

340
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:25,451
Virtual Coffee breakout rooms,
because the group wasn't that

341
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:29,491
neither of these groups were
huge. Well by numbers, Py Ladies

342
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,622
Boston is bottom was huge, but
the number of people who would

343
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:33,421
come to the actual big monthly
meetups, wasn't that big. And

344
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,220
the

345
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:38,016
number of people that come to
these where maybe three to

346
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,811
seven,

347
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:46,392
you know, so I'd just be hanging
out in this coffee shop and we

348
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:52,096
just sort of take over a table.
I didn't get space, but yeah, I

349
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,366
think that's an, another thing
is for, for me, also overall

350
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:58,636
like

351
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:01,307
Boston Ruby Women. We basically
didn't even do presentations at

352
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,356
all. It was more, but I think
this is in a way, like more

353
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:11,896
relevant for, uh, women and
underrepresented minorities. It

354
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:14,987
really helps to have a group
where you can talk about like

355
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,946
what's going on at work. And the
other people in the group, like

356
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,022
really understand because
they're in similar situations.

357
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,977
Um, so

358
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,752
Boston Ruby Women we base, it
was borderline just a Ruby

359
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:28,487
Women's

360
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,676
Happy Hour got sponsored by
thoughtbot, know? So we just

361
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,865
like

362
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:38,672
chill out at thoughtbot half the
time be talking about like,

363
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:44,102
what's going on at our jobs and
with PyLadies Boston, I also

364
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:48,842
didn't want it to be
presentations all the time. A.

365
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:55,021
Because it's, as an organizer,
it's really hard to actually get

366
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,541
a monthly presenter, like
someone who wants to present

367
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,490
every single

368
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,996
month. And one of the things I
ended up doing was, uh,

369
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,501
rotating.

370
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:11,882
So I'd have presentations one
month. talks the next a panel,

371
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,787
usually about work. Those were
very popular. So I'd get like

372
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,662
six

373
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:19,412
different women. Sort of like
different stages in their career

374
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:23,192
and doing different things about
like what they do and like what

375
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:26,522
work is like, what problems they
run into. Um, what else did I

376
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,852
do?

377
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,402
Oh, I started doing mob
programming, which was also fun.

378
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:35,832
It was hard to get people to
want to volunteer.

379
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,991
Bekah: you describe what mob
programming

380
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,856
Jennifer: sure. mob programming,
at least the way we did it.

381
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,491
It's.

382
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:46,777
Uh, the whole room is looking at
the same problem. So I would,

383
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:50,131
other piece, I would usually put
myself as a Guinea pig for any

384
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,906
of

385
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,976
these. Like, I always had to
have a presentation ready or

386
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,046
some code

387
00:20:57,076 --> 00:21:00,826
because if we ran out of time,
I'm like, well, got to keep it

388
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:06,646
going. And so. For example, I
had this silly Python game I had

389
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:10,906
written a while back and took it
up there and I would run people

390
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,141
through like the premise of what
was going on in the code and

391
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:15,376
then

392
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:20,807
asked for suggestions on things
that I should consider changing

393
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:24,527
or like what they see that could
be improved, anything like that.

394
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,381
So, It's fun. Not a ton of
places do it at work, but

395
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:31,096
occasionally

396
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:35,507
people do sort of like pairing
with a massive group. So if

397
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:37,336
you're in a good environment, it
can be really fun.

398
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,646
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. We tried that
one. We tried it once with the

399
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:44,817
Cleveland React meetup, it was,
it was a it was interesting. I

400
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,787
feel like with some practice, so
yeah, you can, you can make it

401
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:50,247
like a pretty cool thing. That's
awesome. I love how the

402
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,376
concentration of like the small
groups and the kind of like the

403
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,946
less of... you said, the happy
hour, like less, less of talking

404
00:21:57,946 --> 00:22:00,467
of technical issues and more of
just laying, you know, community

405
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:04,576
support and, um, like just
coming together, you know, um,

406
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:09,862
Jennifer: Yeah. Also with our,
um, with our lightening talks,

407
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:12,036
uh, one of the things I
encourage was just like, you can

408
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,730
give a

409
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:18,442
lightning talk on anything cause
I wanted it to good place to.

410
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,211
Encourage women to feel
comfortable giving

411
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:22,980
presentations.

412
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:27,751
so like one of our members did a
presentation that everyone loved

413
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,931
on birds like birdwatching, you
know, and, and getting, and

414
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:34,111
there

415
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:37,051
were plenty of people who did
technical topics, I think

416
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:43,442
oftentimes, um, and I still feel
this way. I like if, when it

417
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:48,092
comes to submitting a talk to a
conference on like, I'm not an

418
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:53,731
expert on any technical topics.
So I can't give a talk on any of

419
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,791
those. And I know that's not
necessarily a healthy thing to

420
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,741
think about, but at the same
time, I know that's what a lot

421
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:00,691
of

422
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:05,852
people feel. So I didn't want to
be forcing people to technical

423
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,672
talks and have that be the only
option I felt like you need to

424
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:11,551
build up confidence in other
ways, like be okay with public

425
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,281
speaking first and then deal
with.

426
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:15,922
Dan: Yeah,

427
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:17,412
Jennifer: insecurity around
getting a talk on to on

428
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:18,902
something

429
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:19,501
technical.

430
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,537
Dan: That seems like pretty good
advice that reminds me of, um,

431
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:26,507
was that organization that, that
Gant worked with, um,

432
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:29,517
Bekah: Toastmasters

433
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:33,017
Dan: as there's like a, uh,
organization just about, you

434
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,081
know, public speaking and
getting good at it. And so they

435
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,145
would do

436
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:39,116
talks all the time, but I doubt,
I doubt it. I'm some of Gant's

437
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:43,277
were technical, but I liked the
idea of, I don't know, getting

438
00:23:43,277 --> 00:23:46,186
used to it without having to
like, worry about all the extra

439
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:49,666
stuff. It's like learn one thing
at a time, you know, like, you

440
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,487
know, yeah. No, I love that. I
love that.

441
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:54,257
Bekah: I keep wanting to do like
a lightning talk session with

442
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:58,037
Virtual Coffee. That's like five
minutes and talk about something

443
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,826
you're interested in. That's not
technical because I think it's

444
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:05,027
also a really fun way to learn
new things and oh, that's the

445
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,326
person that I can talk to about
rock climbing or, you know,

446
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:11,636
whatever Um, of the things that
this reminded me of, and I

447
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:14,646
wanted

448
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:18,396
to talk to you about, so talking
about this idea of talking

449
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,601
speaking technically. And I
think one of the things that I

450
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,806
was told

451
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,591
early in my career is not to do
community because women are

452
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,346
often

453
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:33,096
seen as, you do community, then
people only know you for

454
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,126
community. And they think that
you're non-technical. So I

455
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:37,156
wanted

456
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:39,316
to get your take on that and
kind of like what the balance

457
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:41,476
is.

458
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:46,882
Jennifer: That's probably partly
true, but part of me is like, I

459
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:52,461
don't care because I want to
help people. And if someone

460
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:56,871
thinks

461
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,319
that, you know, running. a user
group is, is women's work well,

462
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,766
A

463
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,221
like that's, that's really
frustrating. I'm sure there are

464
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,645
a

465
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:11,527
lot of people who think that,
that seems extremely real to me,

466
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:18,277
even though the majority of user
groups are run by men, uh, you

467
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,137
know, who tend to get plenty of
conference talks because they

468
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:21,997
run

469
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,974
like a massive user group or
something. Um, And I guess on

470
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,891
the

471
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:31,537
flip side, I think it was
overall beneficial to me. it, I

472
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:35,182
don't

473
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:36,787
want to say publicity, but I
feel like it got me a lot of

474
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,392
like sort

475
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:43,701
of tech, publicity, um, in a way
that I don't think I was

476
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:48,172
necessarily expecting. Uh, so I
would have people reach out to

477
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:55,866
me. Um, That I don't think they
would have if I wasn't so uh,

478
00:25:55,957 --> 00:26:00,817
doing the work with PyLadies
Boston. So I, I think it was

479
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:02,571
overall good. I'm sure there
were some people are like, this

480
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,325
person

481
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:09,007
spends all their actually time
on user groups gross, but if it

482
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,657
always feels like lose, lose,
like it's like you're supposed

483
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:12,307
to

484
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:17,826
do all of this stuff. You know,
and you are supposed to network,

485
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:22,567
know, but you're also, um,
supposed to be coding like

486
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:27,696
nonstop in your free time, which
actually like that's, that's

487
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:33,067
another thing I feel like I used
to think negatively about and I

488
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:37,596
think it was PyLadies that
changed my mind. And that's

489
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:45,207
partly because I realized that.
Really, like, like real

490
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:50,787
networking is building actual,
meaningful relationships, but

491
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:53,591
they happen to be with people
who are in your, um, wow. I'm

492
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:56,395
totally

493
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:59,126
forgetting a word, but sort of
like your work circle, you know,

494
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:01,588
that, and. 'Cause. 'Cause I
think sometimes people think

495
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:04,050
like, oh,

496
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:08,372
I'll just out to this rando on
LinkedIn, you know, and see if

497
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:09,826
they'll refer me, that's
networking, you know, or I'll

498
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:11,280
ask

499
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:15,211
this random person I met once,
know about this company and that

500
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,336
will matter. And I'm like, that
does not matter, you know, but

501
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,461
if

502
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:25,162
you're actually building up
relationships like. Yeah, I I've

503
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:30,382
definitely referred like really
referred to jobs. Like there's,

504
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:33,531
there's just like posting my
referral link. I don't really

505
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:39,082
count that. in the first startup
I actually worked at, after I

506
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:44,842
left, the contractor that I was
under with TripAdvisor, uh, I

507
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:50,797
referred the woman who was
co-organizing who stepped up to

508
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:54,757
help me co organize PyLadies
Boston,because I was like, I,

509
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:57,637
this point feel really strongly
that I know her work ethic, and

510
00:27:57,637 --> 00:28:00,037
I

511
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:02,106
know that she would be an asset
here. And so I advocated for

512
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,175
her,

513
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:06,501
you know, and to me, that's
what, that's what you really

514
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,346
want out

515
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:12,126
of networking. But you only get
that if you relationships and

516
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:15,926
show people like what you're
about and. And what you, I

517
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:19,666
guess,

518
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:24,886
like what you value, right. And
they're like, oh, I want that

519
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:30,067
person on my team. They're so
great. Like I want to work with

520
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,916
them and you don't get that from
a one-off interaction. And I

521
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,287
think that's one of the things I
liked about Virtual Coffee. I

522
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:38,227
like that we do the small
breakout rooms and I think it

523
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,787
gives us a chance to build those
meaningful connections and make

524
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:47,467
us more likely that in the we'll
be able to actually refer each

525
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,226
other, you know, and advocate
for each other when trying to

526
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,866
get

527
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:51,686
people hired.

528
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:52,656
Bekah: It's

529
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:56,011
Dan: absolutely. My list of
Virtual Coffee members that I

530
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:59,551
want to work, can work with is
very long, you know? And it's,

531
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,481
it's all, it's all that, it's
the, it's like the longterm, you

532
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,786
know, connections. The
networking metaphor is

533
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,091
interesting. You

534
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,991
know, it's if you meet somebody
once and then walk away, is it.

535
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,576
Are they really in your network,
you know, if you're like

536
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,151
building

537
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:19,071
on purpose, you know, like that
means strong connections. And

538
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:22,761
that means, you know, actually
spending time and effort on it,

539
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:26,511
you know, um, the, the term has
gotten loaded with a lot of

540
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:30,836
negative connotations for sure.
Like, I like everything always

541
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:35,017
does after a while, but it's one
of the reasons why, like, you

542
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,966
know, LinkedIn is a dumpster
fire, but like the, the, the

543
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:38,915
fact

544
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,611
that like the interesting part
of the LinkedIn model is like

545
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,306
the

546
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:44,047
first connection, second
connection, you know, like that

547
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:48,487
sort of thing, you know, um, is
like valuable information or,

548
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,286
well, maybe not on LinkedIn, but
you know, be, you know, that

549
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:51,996
sort

550
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:54,247
of thing. Right? have like a
strong connection with this

551
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,916
person. I have worked with them
or I've, you know, uh, and then

552
00:29:56,926 --> 00:29:59,321
you're like, okay, well, If
Bekah recommends somebody to me

553
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,716
that I

554
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,926
don't know, that person is going
to be higher on my list than

555
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:08,737
people that I don't know at all.
Right. So it's like, sorry,

556
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,977
there's somebody slamming doors
outside, but, yeah. So I don't

557
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,376
know. I, I liked the way that I
liked the way that you were, you

558
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:15,846
were thinking about that. It's
it's cool. Let's see.

559
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,316
Interesting

560
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:17,707
stuff.

561
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:21,257
Bekah: You were saying, you made
a lot of connections through

562
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,152
building community for people
who reached out to you for jobs

563
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:25,047
I

564
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:27,486
know been true for me. And one
of the nice parts of it is I

565
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,925
have a

566
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:33,166
whole group of people that I can
recommend. And so I think, you

567
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:37,007
know, when you get to that point
you know people, then you make

568
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:40,517
those personal connections and
it's really great to see, you

569
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:43,606
know, how far that goes out. You
know, I recommended a person for

570
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:47,227
a job. there. And then when they
left, they recommended another

571
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:52,446
person. Right. so then this
whole cycle of, know helping us

572
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:54,156
advocate for each other.

573
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:55,747
Jennifer: a hundred percent.

574
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:01,291
Bekah: So, okay. So the second.
One of the second pieces of

575
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:05,251
advice I got after starting
Virtual Coffee. this resonated

576
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:08,731
when you were talking about not
making people pay for PyLadies

577
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:12,872
was, well, if you're going to do
community, then you, you have to

578
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:15,932
charge a membership fee, right?
Like you have to get paid for

579
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:19,882
your time. And that's something
at Virtual Coffee that we've

580
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:22,761
always had a strong stance
against. You know, we never want

581
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:28,192
to make anyone pay for access to
and the content that we produce,

582
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:34,192
because think it's important to
allow that and for everyone in

583
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,076
our community. So what, was
what, I guess, what are your

584
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:41,960
thoughts

585
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:45,172
on that of like people have to
pay for your time?

586
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,582
Jennifer: Uh, if it's not clear
here I a hundred percent agree

587
00:31:50,582 --> 00:32:01,382
with not so with, with things
being free. here's the thing. to

588
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:04,051
me, it depends on who it is.
Like a company is asking me for

589
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:06,720
advice

590
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:12,031
or someone is basically asking
me to effectively consult their

591
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:17,082
work. Yeah. No, pay me for my
time. Like. You know, I'm doing

592
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:19,721
work to further the capitalist
machine. Like I want money,

593
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:21,017
Dan: Yeah.

594
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:23,022
Jennifer: when it comes to
people who are potentially

595
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:24,942
unemployed,

596
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:30,491
you know, and are just trying to
better their own life situation,

597
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,417
like, no, I don't want your
money. Like, especially. I

598
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,892
think,

599
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:39,912
especially like where, where I
was like Coffee is obviously a

600
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:42,461
little bit broader, but at the
same time, there are so many

601
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:48,491
juniors in there. I'm like, I
don't, I never felt right. my

602
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,761
primary audience with PyLadies
was people who are not

603
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,741
developers

604
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:56,681
being like, yeah, I'm a
developer making, know, a good

605
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:58,510
salary or.

606
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:05,231
Can you pay me to, to, to help
you get there too. I you're not

607
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:08,352
making that much money, but give
some more of your money to me.

608
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:08,811
Dan: Okay.

609
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:13,961
Jennifer: I don't know. Maybe I,
maybe this is like the socialist

610
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:14,321
in me

611
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:14,757
Bekah: Okay

612
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,561
Jennifer: where I was like, no,
I want to help build people up.

613
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,901
And

614
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:26,096
I guess maybe I also like don't
necessarily. I think that highly

615
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:29,681
of myself, that, you know, by
advice is worth money. So I

616
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:33,266
would

617
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,527
feel really bad asking someone
to pay for it. And the other

618
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:35,787
thing

619
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:41,067
is I'm not necessarily creating
the content. Right. You know,

620
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,821
there was some times where sure.
Like the class I could have

621
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,575
maybe

622
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,346
charged for that. I didn't feel
right. Doing it. But for the

623
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,086
most

624
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:52,152
part, yeah. members are giving
presentations. Why should I be

625
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:56,291
paid for this? Like if anything,
maybe I could've been like, Hey,

626
00:33:56,291 --> 00:34:02,682
yeah, I'll take donations for,
for the cost of the meetup, but

627
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:08,742
it's really like, even a meetup
is only like, I dunno, like 80

628
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:14,556
bucks every six months or
something. It's not that huge in

629
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,806
the scale of things, especially
if you're making a software dev

630
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,431
salary within the U S so I was
just like, to be honest, it's

631
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:22,056
not

632
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,456
even worth it. Cause then I have
to think about taxes

633
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:24,556
Bekah: Okay.

634
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:27,141
Jennifer: about getting gifts
and paying, like, to me, the

635
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,496
other

636
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:33,547
thing I'm like, it's not even
worth the potential tax headache

637
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:38,677
of creating like a business and
getting paid for this. When also

638
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:44,371
I to do this. I want to help
people, like I'm not doing this

639
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:47,341
for money, I'm doing this
because like, I think, I mean, I

640
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:50,311
think

641
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:54,211
everyone should learn to code
period, I also think being a

642
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:57,391
software developers is stinking
easy job. Like it's frustrating,

643
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:59,521
but it's not that hard, you

644
00:34:59,561 --> 00:34:59,831
Bekah: Yeah.

645
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,396
Jennifer: And I think pretty
much like anyone can do it. We

646
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,941
paid

647
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:09,702
way too much. And there are too
many jobs. Like even now, Where

648
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:14,831
it's really hard for juniors to
find a job. I know, at the same

649
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:18,222
time, it's because companies are
like, I don't know, we can only

650
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:25,572
hire seniors. And they're an
absolutely absurd amount like

651
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:28,661
Amazon, which I'm pretty sure
they wouldn't want to hire me

652
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:33,882
anyway for a number of reasons.
Um, like they keep emailing me

653
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,322
and I keep like this last time,
I think I responded back with,

654
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:36,762
how

655
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:42,492
do I get blocklisted by Amazon?
Like, please let me know. I want

656
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:46,572
to be on a block list. also that
is, I think proof, like, there

657
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:49,871
are a lot of people who think
like, oh, if I do like then this

658
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:59,351
massive company is never gonna
hire me. No. I have like twitter

659
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:04,961
account that how unions are, you
know, and Amazon recruiters are

660
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:09,280
so like, "Want to for Amazon?"

661
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:10,092
Bekah: Uh,

662
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:15,489
Jennifer: like, frickin' no, I
don't, you know, but, sorry, I

663
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:15,820
just

664
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,440
Bekah: that was fantastic. No,
no. I love that. I wish that

665
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,280
everybody could have watched you
give that speech there because

666
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,989
your body language was
fantastic.

667
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:31,985
Jennifer: I'm just full of like
rants and hot takes about tech.

668
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:35,764
Bekah: my like when you're in my
breakout room, I'm like, yes.

669
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:42,168
Dan: Oh man. Yeah, I did. This
podcast needs more hot takes.

670
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,793
Anyway. I think, you know, if
there's one thing missing, I

671
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:47,418
like

672
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,289
the, I mean, I I agree with
everything you said though. And.

673
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:53,138
You know, we, as, as people,
like when you're running a

674
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:54,728
community

675
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:59,349
and stuff, you'll get advice or
whatever, and part of it for me,

676
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,289
the way I've been thinking about
it, what you know is like, it's

677
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,549
not a, it's not a product,
right? We don't have people, you

678
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:04,809
know,

679
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:08,679
you get people that come in
sometimes to communities and

680
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,284
want, just want something and
to, you know, leave again, you

681
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:11,889
know,

682
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:16,398
but, uh, I think. That is
another benefit of more intimate

683
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:18,663
communities, uh, you know, is,
is you get a lot less of that,

684
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:20,567
you

685
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,628
know, if you had, if your group
was just like people coming in

686
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:27,498
and saying job, please, and then
leave, you know, like, uh, all

687
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:28,758
the time, then that's like,
okay, let's turn this into a

688
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:30,018
product.

689
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:33,498
And just like charge people you
know, but it's not, um, that's

690
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:36,048
not what like most communities
are about. Uh, it's certainly

691
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,724
possible to turn a community
into a product and make money

692
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,400
off of

693
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,664
it. uh you see lot of people
doing it, but you know, it's, I

694
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:46,893
don't know. Then it's then I
start thinking of it as a

695
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,093
different thing than a community
at that point, you know, you

696
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:49,293
know

697
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:51,545
what I mean? It becomes... a

698
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:54,350
Jennifer: as organizers, like
you also get a ton out of it.

699
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,405
And I

700
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,814
think that's the other thing
that felt weird. Cause in a way

701
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:59,223
I'm

702
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:00,709
like, well, I'm probably
actually getting the most out of

703
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:02,194
this.

704
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:08,550
Like not only am I getting to
constantly try to you know flex

705
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,320
my mentoring muscles and get
better at that. Um, because I'm

706
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,239
the one like making up the
random extra time, you know, I

707
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,158
have to

708
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,400
give way more presentations I'm
still not the world's greatest

709
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,229
public speaker, but did I
improve drastically from having

710
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,058
to give a

711
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,179
bunch of mediocre presentations
at PyLadies? Hell yeah, I did.

712
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,230
know, and I was the one there
every single month, which means

713
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,119
got to meet a bunch of
absolutely amazing people. So

714
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,559
yeah, it's

715
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,709
like, I, I'm getting the more
out of this than anyone else.

716
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:42,859
Why

717
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,480
should people pay

718
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:44,945
Dan: Yeah

719
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,260
Jennifer: also to basically just
meet me?

720
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,829
Bekah: And pay for your
autograph.

721
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,920
Jennifer: tell you right now.
Don't don't pay for that

722
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,369
pleasure.

723
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,398
Dan: When you put it that way
and that makes me want to charge

724
00:38:58,398 --> 00:38:58,668
people.

725
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,929
Jennifer: Just charge for
autographs.

726
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:06,625
Bekah: We told you we were
charging for this podcast

727
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,403
episode, is one.

728
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:09,679
Dan: We'll send you, we'll send
you the bill.

729
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,104
Jennifer: I'll S I'll send them
the same one we can do, you

730
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:13,134
know,

731
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:19,664
in, in trade it kind trade for
the pleasure of of each other's

732
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:20,224
company.

733
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,539
Bekah: All right, so I'm ready
for some more hot takes. So you

734
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,960
are, have done a lot of work to
get women and minorities into

735
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,389
tech. So are things that
companies are doing that exclude

736
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,110
women or the red flags that we
should look out for?

737
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:50,925
Jennifer: Uh, well, my favorite
is the stuff you don't get until

738
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:56,304
you're actually there. And
especially this. think it's

739
00:39:56,835 --> 00:40:02,090
specififcally towards possibly
some other minorities, but I

740
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,429
think specifically women where
you get called, like you're more

741
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:11,630
likely to be called like cynical
or shoot. I'm trying to think of

742
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,449
another thing from one of my
reviews. at splice, but at a

743
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,630
recent company that will not be
I an article put in my review.

744
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,104
Again, I'm a native US English
speaker how to be more polite

745
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,578
and

746
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:39,320
tactful in American English. You
know, so I stopped doing those

747
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,909
things, like, you know, think
about If you're a manager

748
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,257
Dan: did they think you were
like Canadian or something

749
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:47,427
Jennifer: N no, for

750
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:48,074
Dan: Sorry

751
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:53,960
Jennifer: sure. For sure. Not,
but even if, Canadians also like

752
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,394
really any like Um, you're a
manager listening to this

753
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:01,143
Dan: and have been

754
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:05,405
Jennifer: like, well, I got
feedback from this woman's

755
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,745
coworkers on how she was. So
brusque consider if that

756
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,085
feedback

757
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:12,335
might be gendered and maybe
don't give it to him, to her

758
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,585
and,

759
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,190
Bekah: Yeah.

760
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:18,635
Jennifer: tell him. The people
who gave you that feedback, but

761
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:23,465
they should probably sit with,
their, uh, preconceptions of how

762
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:29,014
a woman should speak. Um, but to
me, like the biggest struggle,

763
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:31,384
and I think why we've had so
many trouble, is often aren't

764
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:33,754
ton of

765
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:42,619
glaring red flags in Um, cause
honestly, so one of. You can't

766
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:49,190
even count on diversity. One of,
one of my favorite teams that I

767
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:56,349
worked on was me and all white
dudes. But they were wonderful

768
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,585
Like I still talk to a lot of
these guys. They were the most

769
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,549
supportive, I think of almost
any other team worked on. You

770
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,513
know,

771
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:05,704
one of them would regularly if
he was working on something

772
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:09,065
interesting. Call me over to, to
pair be like, I think this would

773
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:11,360
be really fascinating for you.
Like, um, dig into this. And

774
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,655
this

775
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:16,715
was when I was only maybe like a
couple of years into my career.

776
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:21,125
So. Like still pretty junior,
like, you know, egging into

777
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,744
mid-level. I know at this point,
like people are like senior

778
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,363
after

779
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:27,634
two years, whatever. Um, it's
all meaningless. Um, you're

780
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:30,904
senior

781
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:34,775
after two years, where are you
going? Like your career is going

782
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:38,795
to be like fricking 30 years
plus years long. Um,

783
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:39,844
Bekah: burnout.

784
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:43,324
Jennifer: go at a certain point.
Um, that's another. Okay. Uh,

785
00:42:43,324 --> 00:42:46,714
And

786
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:49,934
versus a company that I worked
at that was extremely diverse

787
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,974
or,

788
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:56,684
well, extremely diverse was
like, okay, on gender issues.

789
00:42:56,684 --> 00:43:00,394
But if we

790
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:06,815
brought up any sort of racial or
ethnicity issues, it was, it was

791
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:11,465
bad. It was, it was real bad. I
was at one point accused of anti

792
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:15,875
Southern bias. At that I am a
Southerner by the way, I grew up

793
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,525
in Alabama, as I mentioned, I
lived in Georgia for seven

794
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,175
years.

795
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:26,195
I still that's still most of my
life, so I still very much

796
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:29,764
identify as a southerner. And
yeah, I was because I had

797
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:30,979
mentioned something about long
voting lines throughout the

798
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:32,194
south

799
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:35,224
and I'm just like, well, hi. I
remember standing in a really

800
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:37,414
long line in Atlanta. I don't
know about you.

801
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:39,425
Bekah: yeah,

802
00:43:40,804 --> 00:43:42,889
Jennifer: so. I've I've
basically found that I don't

803
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,974
feel. And the

804
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:48,965
other thing is I've, even if
you're trying to judge based on

805
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:51,515
diversity, you might not even be
giving answers. Like when I

806
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:54,065
asked

807
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:58,054
at one point in one company I
joined the interview about like,

808
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:03,675
what, uh, of like how womendo do
you have in engineering The guy

809
00:44:03,695 --> 00:44:06,394
was like, oh yeah. You know,
like, I don't have the exact

810
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,454
numbers, but like, know, yeah.
We have like, women are in

811
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,742
engineering management. And then
I joined looking at the org

812
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:14,030
chart

813
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:20,269
and there like three women in
engineering. Me, woman on my

814
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:22,864
team, one person in QA, there is
no one in management. I was

815
00:44:22,864 --> 00:44:25,459
like,

816
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:37,085
What So, so. I mean, honestly,
like, I feel like the big things

817
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:40,114
for companies I'm just like,
stop doing most of what you're

818
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:41,524
doing.

819
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:47,885
Um, like it's, it's all bad. Um,
but like don't, don't lie to

820
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,760
people because also if someone
really cares about that, going

821
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,635
to

822
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:57,034
be put off and they're going to
leave quickly. Um, you know, try

823
00:44:57,034 --> 00:45:00,664
to be honest about where you
are, like this is for any hiring

824
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:04,994
managers. The honest about where
you are and where you actually

825
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:12,644
are trying to go. Um, and the
other thing is when people, and

826
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:18,914
people of color your company and
give you feedback on how the

827
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:25,429
process is going. I think. Don't
react negatively. Like don't get

828
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,994
defensive I think that's the,
the hardest thing. Cause I've

829
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:30,559
been in

830
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:33,409
many places where I've tried to
be like, Hey, I think we should

831
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:36,980
consider doing this. And people
have gotten extremely defensive

832
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,742
and it's like, I didn't care, I
would just leave. I don't need

833
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:45,754
to

834
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,965
stay here. Like I'm only giving
this feedback and trying to make

835
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:53,525
it better because I care about
where I am and I want, I want

836
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:55,190
this to be like a better place
to work. I want people to, to

837
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,855
love

838
00:45:56,855 --> 00:46:01,795
it, you know? And, and I think a
lot of times people miss that,

839
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:08,985
you know that if you are giving,
if you're trying to get involved

840
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:13,094
in, in, and that's, the other
thing is don't don't necessarily

841
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:19,744
make. Women and minorities do D
I efforts, but also consider

842
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:23,914
talking to least some of them if
you're consider implementing a

843
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,934
change, because I've seen a lot
of changes for the good of

844
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,954
equity

845
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:35,775
and diversity rolled out that
were quite poor

846
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:37,414
Bekah: Yeah

847
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:42,699
Dan: Sure. Do you have any, do
you have any advice for for.

848
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:46,619
Somebody Who, so, so maybe went
through the interview red flags,

849
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,768
you know, landed in a position
like that, where they're

850
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:52,639
uncomfortable, maybe like, and I
suppose the experience is going

851
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,949
to be different if you're coming
in as a senior or somebody, you

852
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:56,508
know, a little more comfortable.
I mean, I don't want to speak

853
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:58,067
for

854
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,048
you, but I would imagine you
would have no problem just

855
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:03,139
quitting a job. Right. Uh, you
know, like if you're

856
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,389
uncomfortable, but if you're, if
it's your first job, for

857
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,028
instance, a first tech job,
especially something like that,

858
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,920
you have any, I any

859
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,775
Jennifer: If first job, it's
extremely toxic. If it's

860
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:15,455
extremely toxic just start
applying You got one job. You

861
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,135
can

862
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:21,784
probably get another don't. I
would generally not recommend

863
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:25,054
quitting before you have another
job. I've only ever done that

864
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:29,704
once. And it was a really,
really, really bad environment.

865
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:34,565
But I also talked to my husband
about it and was like, can we

866
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:38,494
afford to do this? And he was
like, because I'm tired of you

867
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:43,873
complaining this terrible place
Um he still didn't get rid of me

868
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:44,914
complaining about that for
probably like two years. Cause

869
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:45,934
it

870
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:49,339
was that bad. Um, so it's, if
it's really bad start looking

871
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:52,744
for

872
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:57,320
another job, like if it's
extremely toxic, it's. Just a

873
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,139
bunch of things where you're
like, Ugh, this is really

874
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:03,064
annoying. Try to buckle down.
And know, if it's your first

875
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:05,989
job,

876
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,139
even getting just a year of
experience is going to make you

877
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,619
put you in a better position to
get a better job. And I, I

878
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:14,269
generally don't think you have
to stay out of a job for a year,

879
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,919
but

880
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,210
again, when it's your first tech
job, you need experience. Um, so

881
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:26,000
being able to say just suck it
up, hopefully people with more.

882
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,119
Power in that particular
workplace will speak up. I don't

883
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:40,070
want to, I, the reason I try to
speak up is because I am

884
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,130
confident in my ability to
quickly get another job. If

885
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,852
things go downhill, do I want to
be fired? No. But, you know, do

886
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:48,574
I

887
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:50,179
feel like it's my responsibility
for people who are coming in,

888
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,784
who

889
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:55,144
are more junior who have less
power, like to make sure that

890
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:58,954
they're in a safe as safe a work
environment as I can make it.

891
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:03,244
Yes. But if you are that person
who is more junior, do not feel

892
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:08,554
obligated to speak up because
you're just not in the best

893
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:12,109
position to do that. Once you
start getting. Next level

894
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:15,664
senior,

895
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:17,975
maybe start advocating for
others a bit more because it

896
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:20,255
really is

897
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:27,364
important we all, like, I don't
think it should only be up to,

898
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:30,544
um, women and underrepresented
minorities to call out racism

899
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:32,344
and

900
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,096
sexism in the workplace. Um,
and. It can be a little

901
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:37,848
frustrating.

902
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:43,070
Um, when you know, I'm working
with, uh, a bunch of guys and

903
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:46,070
they're all, they're all really
great, but you know, they're not

904
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:50,929
really, they're not dealing with
the same crap that I am, cause

905
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:53,929
they're not putting themselves
out there and pushing back

906
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:57,170
against bad policies. So,

907
00:49:57,668 --> 00:49:57,969
Dan: Yeah

908
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:04,730
Jennifer: but if you're junior,
on tight, uh, it'll get better.

909
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:10,099
Don't give up, even though tech
is mostly trash, like, our most

910
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:12,860
workplaces, you're a bunch of
people talking about quitting

911
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,070
tech and I'm like, nowhere's
better. Everywhere. Sucks.

912
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:16,460
Bekah: Yeah

913
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:17,423
Dan: Uh, my, my,

914
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,605
Bekah: academia's awful

915
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:23,673
Dan: yeah, the academia. Um, I
have no my imagi I always

916
00:50:23,673 --> 00:50:24,768
imagined just going into the
woods, you know, by myself. If

917
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:25,863
I,

918
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:29,523
when I imagine quitting you know
it there's no people around him.

919
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:31,788
I imagined, you know, ideal job,
trees and stuff. I don't, I

920
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:34,053
don't

921
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:35,043
know what the job is

922
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:38,304
Bekah: Dan Daniel also work with
me

923
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:40,126
Dan: don't know going to oh
yeah. Well, you're fine. You

924
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:41,888
know, most

925
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,878
times, but, uh, no

926
00:50:43,969 --> 00:50:44,309
Jennifer: You can

927
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:44,929
Dan: just tech is

928
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:45,594
Jennifer: ranger.

929
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,289
Dan: tech. Yeah. Forest ranger.
I feel like I I

930
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:48,599
Jennifer: There's

931
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,099
Dan: ended up.

932
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:49,735
Jennifer: there.

933
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:52,039
Dan: Yeah. I feel like you just
ended up having to like, be

934
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:53,343
chasing kids out of the park
that had smoking weed or so

935
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:54,558
they're

936
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,869
not, I don't know, whatever, you
know, like, you know, just being

937
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:00,259
like a security guard, almost
ranger I need something yet. I

938
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:05,958
need like a trail maintenance. I
don't know where it's somewhere

939
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:07,574
somewhere, far away so I can
just disappear for a couple of

940
00:51:07,574 --> 00:51:08,929
months

941
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:09,469
and then come back

942
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:10,565
Jennifer: Rural Canada.

943
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,693
Dan: Yeah I'll go in Algonquin.
It's something like that.

944
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:14,747
Anyway.

945
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:15,259
That's

946
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:19,889
Bekah: I found one of the things
that's been helpful for me is in

947
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,219
having a community and then
having a network. There are

948
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:26,880
enough people that I know or
connections through people. I

949
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,239
know that I can ask What what is
this work environment like and

950
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,480
get an honest answer. And that
has been so important. So

951
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,309
networking is important to find
a job, but also it's very

952
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:39,138
important

953
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:43,489
to find a good job. And like, I
don't mean pay, I mean, good

954
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:44,090
place to work.

955
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,248
Dan: And actually that just made
me think that another bonus is

956
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:51,513
having people to ask advice of
in, in, if they're in

957
00:51:51,513 --> 00:51:53,298
situations,

958
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:54,678
you know, where they're not sure
what to do or whatever, you

959
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,058
know,

960
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:57,573
actually having somebody who's
been through that, uh, to, to

961
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,087
ask

962
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:00,798
us bonus of community.

963
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:06,559
Jennifer: I think that can help.
But caveat is like one of what

964
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,480
was for me, like one of the jobs
I've had was that a place that

965
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,250
friends worked at and they loved
and other people I knew work at

966
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:22,610
in loved, but. Like I ended up
not only did I get under leveled

967
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,550
when I joined and that's
something that's hard to tell

968
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,840
because every place is leveling
is totally different, know? So I

969
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,329
don't know until I joined it,
I'm like, wait, what? Now I see

970
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:38,329
everyone's levels This messed
up. Um, it's also a lot of

971
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:41,329
places to

972
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:44,449
really dependent on your
manager. And so the people who

973
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:47,569
were. Being

974
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,230
like, oh, this is such a good
place. They all had a different

975
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,944
manager than me. I did end up
switching teams at a, at a

976
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:56,658
point,

977
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:05,150
but like original manager was
really, really bad. And like

978
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,780
that, that's sort of the thing
with. What have you said about

979
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,440
like a home Depot? I had net
positive experience working

980
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,340
there, partly because I did
coworker and I ended up talking

981
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,510
to HR about situation and they
were able to remedy it for her,

982
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,679
but not for me because straight
up part of it, I was like, well,

983
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,820
I don't think this job is right
for me. Like, if I had a

984
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,750
different manager, um, But I
think my experience would have

985
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,760
been totally different and I
probably would've stayed longer

986
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,489
than like eight months. I'd had
a better, a better manager that

987
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:40,218
I

988
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:44,179
know did exist there, you know?
So

989
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:45,679
Dan: Oh, on.

990
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:52,550
Jennifer: really, I feel like it
can help. It can potentially get

991
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:58,340
you away from like really bad
situations, but not a guarantee.

992
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:03,015
Which sucks, it did help. Like
one of, uh, one of my really

993
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:05,655
good

994
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:08,445
friends works at Splice we
talked a lot before I even

995
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,235
applied. And

996
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:13,844
she was like, oh yeah, like
here's the crappy shit that's

997
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:17,175
going on. Or that has gone on,
you know, is going on. And I was

998
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:22,994
like, oh, that all actually
sounds fine to me. none of those

999
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:25,862
are deal breakers. I'm, I'm
good. I'll apply. That sounds

1000
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,730
great.

1001
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,239
Sounds so much better than now.

1002
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:34,889
Dan: I'm trying to think. I
don't even know. Are there any

1003
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:35,849
other

1004
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:38,039
hot buttons can push or

1005
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:43,175
Jennifer: One take I'm planning
on writing on my blog is that

1006
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:46,476
may, which I think getting to be
less and less of a hot take.

1007
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,615
Good. Um, is that being a
full-stack developer is

1008
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:53,464
bullshit.

1009
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:58,385
one, no one is truly a hundred
percent full stack because it is

1010
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,846
fricking impossible because it
is hard enough to keep up with

1011
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:03,096
all

1012
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:05,286
of the front end things only.
And it's hard enough to keep,

1013
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,476
uh, to

1014
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:12,065
fully learn a backend language,
to get to the point where you're

1015
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:17,391
end optimizing your database,
every, like it's hard enough to

1016
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,525
really gain any sort of
expertise either side and anyone

1017
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,360
who says

1018
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,770
they're a full-stack developer,
I'm sort of like, Hmm. But

1019
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,180
what's

1020
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:27,335
your favorite because that's
what you're actually good at.

1021
00:55:27,335 --> 00:55:28,489
And the

1022
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,320
other thing is just the thing
you're sort of forced to do. And

1023
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,471
you're probably not doing very
well. I say that as someone who

1024
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:38,391
has been a full stack developer
and has been poorly doing HTML

1025
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:43,295
and CSS forever Script probably
fine. Like I've had to do it for

1026
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:47,885
long enough that I I'm fine at
it, but put me on like some real

1027
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:51,470
like front end front end. And
I'm like, where's bootstrap. Oh,

1028
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,055
I

1029
00:55:55,056 --> 00:56:00,335
have to make a change to
bootstrap. lets not. just, let's

1030
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:02,706
just make this super bootstrappy
and then we're good.

1031
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,429
Dan: Uh, as somebody who's been
like actual front-end

1032
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:10,519
concentration for a very, very
long time. I absolutely agree

1033
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,004
with you back end stuff. is hard
to, and it's like hard. It's

1034
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,489
hard

1035
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:16,880
to do it well, and there's,
there's so many I don't know I'm

1036
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,860
with ya. I'm with you on it. If
you need a pull quote or

1037
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,219
something

1038
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:21,380
Bekah: Okay

1039
00:56:21,505 --> 00:56:23,275
Jennifer: maybe I'll ask for
some quotes. That'll be fun.

1040
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:25,045
I'll ask

1041
00:56:25,076 --> 00:56:27,536
all of us. That is a question.
And in Virtual Coffee, who wants

1042
00:56:27,536 --> 00:56:29,950
to give me their hot takes on
why being full stack is not, is

1043
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,364
real

1044
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,360
Bekah: what I think it's so
hard. a lot of like full stack

1045
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,980
bootcamp

1046
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:40,001
programs out there. then there
are people coming out of those

1047
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,183
boot camps, looking for full
stack jobs. I just. Struggle

1048
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:48,365
with

1049
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:54,666
that path because your learning
and just come out of a big

1050
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:58,055
learning experience, but it
makes more sense to to be able

1051
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:01,415
to focus

1052
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:07,626
on one aspect and understand the
other for sure, but to really

1053
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:11,994
dive deep into that. So you can,
so you can level up and get to a

1054
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,175
mid level position

1055
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,215
Jennifer: Yeah, I totally agree.
And I think the. Like what's

1056
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:23,525
really pushing This is companies
who want just one developer who

1057
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,686
does their front end, their
backend and their operations.

1058
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:27,666
you

1059
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,775
know, you should know

1060
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:30,831
Dan: okay.

1061
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:35,646
Jennifer: I'm just going to go
with, you know, rails, Ruby. Uh,

1062
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:41,135
PostGrest AWS. I'm probably
probably missing a couple, you

1063
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:44,300
know, probably a Reddis, you
know, gotta toss in Reddis just

1064
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,101
for good, good measure or
something

1065
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,234
Dan: my pet Webpack or whatever,
whatever. Well, I guess if

1066
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:48,343
you're

1067
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:51,465
in grab, you can use whatever
ridiculous nonsense of rails

1068
00:57:51,465 --> 00:57:52,505
does, but, uh

1069
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:53,025
Jennifer: Hotwire now

1070
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:56,146
Dan: yeah. Hotwire

1071
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,195
Bekah: no more no more React

1072
00:57:58,195 --> 00:57:59,239
Dan: it's so funny cause it's
like how it always used to be

1073
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:00,283
and

1074
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:02,985
then it wasn't and then it was,
and you know, it's like, there's

1075
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:06,364
this golden age where. You know
where there were really just

1076
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:08,885
backing in front of developers,
you know, cause it front and got

1077
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:12,375
complicated enough. Backend was
harder than that. It's just,

1078
00:58:13,235 --> 00:58:14,600
Jennifer: I think always been
complicated enough. I say that

1079
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,965
as

1080
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:19,056
someone who was like, you know,
messing around with my angel,

1081
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:21,626
FireSIGHT when I was 13 and, you
know, trying to get scrolling

1082
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:25,175
text, I wasn't that great at it
then. And to be honest, I really

1083
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:26,405
haven't improved that much.

1084
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,844
Dan: yeah, no, it just keeps
getting more complicated.

1085
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:30,896
Jennifer: I can get solid
scrolling text going by but

1086
00:58:30,896 --> 00:58:31,286
That's about it.

1087
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:32,485
Dan: Dope.

1088
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:36,815
Jennifer: My personal built in
Squarespace because you know

1089
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:38,525
don't have time for that shit.

1090
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,614
Dan: That's what somebody was
just asking about that on, on,

1091
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,445
um, on Virtual Coffee, I think

1092
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,260
Jennifer: Oh, really?

1093
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:46,625
Dan: it's okay. Like their
backend developer there, it was

1094
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,650
like a Ruby developer maybe or
something and, um, yeah. And

1095
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,675
they

1096
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:52,894
were just like, is it okay if I
don't, if I use a template or

1097
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:56,054
whatever, you know? Um, yeah. I
mean, my answer was emphatically

1098
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:56,764
Yes. Like,

1099
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,210
Jennifer: Yeah.

1100
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,835
Bekah: a front end developer. I
use a template.

1101
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,710
Dan: Yeah. I mean, whatever

1102
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,501
Bekah: It decreases the barrier
to entry for me. Like I will sit

1103
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:11,429
there and trying to design, I'm
not a designer. Right. Or like

1104
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:12,914
get all of the things Right.
It's just, it's too much work to

1105
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:14,399
have

1106
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,455
to think about that and,
figuring out all of the things.

1107
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:18,510
So

1108
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:20,170
Dan: Yep.

1109
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:23,311
Bekah: somebody has already done
it. They have done it well, it

1110
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:24,619
cost $37

1111
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,130
Jennifer: Yep.

1112
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:28,309
Dan: hard to work on your own
stuff too spend time on it.

1113
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:32,806
Bekah: Well, I think that's an
excellent hot take to end on. So

1114
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:36,795
thank you so much, Jennifer, for
being here and giving us all of

1115
00:59:36,795 --> 00:59:40,485
your hot takes and sharing with
us, your journey. this is really

1116
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:42,585
a really great and a lot of fun.
So thank you.

1117
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:44,809
Jennifer: You're Welcome. I'm
always here for hot takes.

1118
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,343
Anyone

1119
00:59:46,346 --> 00:59:49,385
can hit me up in Virtual Coffee
for the hot take of the day.

1120
00:59:50,135 --> 00:59:52,715
Bekah: Oh yes. We need hot take
of day

1121
00:59:53,896 --> 00:59:54,635
Jennifer: We should

1122
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:58,190
Dan: imagining like a lightening
talks except hot take lightening

1123
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,916
Bekah: Oh Oh, well, if we're
going to do

1124
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,099
Jennifer: That should be of the
weekly reminders. What's take

1125
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:04,670
Dan: Ooh, I like it.

1126
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:08,675
Bekah: well, we need a slack
bot. All right.

1127
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,840
Dan: Oh man. Yes. I'll add my,
thanks to this. This was really

01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,630
great. I appreciate your time
and appreciate you coming on.
