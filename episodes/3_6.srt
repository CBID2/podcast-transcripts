00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:09,022
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode six of

2
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:13,185
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm
Bekah.

3
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,685
And this is a podcast that
features members of the

4
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:20,394
Virtual Coffee community.
Virtual Coffee is an intimate

5
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:21,655
group of developers at all
stages of their coding journey.

6
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,085
And they're here on this
podcast, sharing their stories

7
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,684
and what they've learned. And
we're here to share

8
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:29,635
it with you here with me today,
is my cohost Dan.

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:33,234
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today, we're
joined by Ray Deck.

10
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:37,075
Ray is a trained data scientist
and occasional angel investor

11
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:42,085
and a software entrepreneur. Ray
is also a very active

12
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:45,895
member here at Virtual Coffee.
He lends his time and expertise,

13
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:48,085
as well as he leads a few
different interest groups,

14
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,005
uh, for our members, which we
very much appreciate.

15
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:53,335
We talked with Ray about finding
the right career path through

16
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:58,045
growth, learning and motivation.
Ray shared his thoughts

17
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:59,125
about the importance of trust
and listening.

18
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:01,734
And he drops a bunch of great
resources to help

19
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:03,445
everyone find their own path.

20
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,146
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast like we

21
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:09,775
start every Virtual Coffee. We
introduce ourselves

22
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:12,745
with our name where we're from,
what we do and a

23
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:17,215
random check-in question.
Today's question is what is

24
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:26,632
your favorite nonfiction book?
Hi, my name is Bekah.

25
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:30,331
I'm a front end developer from a
small town in Ohio.

26
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:34,186
And non-fiction is kind of
general.

27
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,486
So I'm going to go two different
directions here.

28
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,746
Um, if I'm talking like memoir
nonfiction, then

29
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:44,507
I'm going to go with Beauty and
the Broken Places.

30
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:50,417
If I'm talking like self-help,
then I'm going to go with

31
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:54,287
Scattered by Gabor Mat. I think
that's how you say it.

32
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:57,257
Um, it's a book that's about
ADHD and it was

33
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:01,066
super helpful to me after I was
diagnosed last year.

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,800
Dan: Hi, uh, hi, I'm Dan. I am a
front end developer

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,110
from Cleveland and yeah, I was,
uh, I was scrambling

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,110
because I was trying to remember
any nonfiction books

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,419
that I had read recently. I, I
don't, I don't read

38
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,669
a lot of nonfiction books mostly
because, uh, I have

39
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,375
trouble getting through them.
Um, And so I don't

40
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,534
think I have a favorite. I
certainly don't have, you

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,634
know, anytime you see favorite,
I think of books that every

42
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:28,405
read, you know, and so there's a
lot of like fiction books,

43
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:32,425
every read a bunch of times. Um,
but so now I'm like

44
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:35,004
scrolling, scrolling through
GoodReads, trying to see if I

45
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:36,865
have anything that I want to.
The Radical Candor was fine.

46
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,395
You know what I mean? It was
like, it was fine.

47
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,314
Um, I appreciated some stuff in
it.

48
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:44,034
I appreciate it. Um, the atomic
habits

49
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:46,435
book, uh, that was cool. I made
it most of the way

50
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:49,044
through both of those. Um, I
actually just

51
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:49,805
started, so this is on this is
that GoodReads.

52
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,615
I'm cheating a little bit, but I
read a book called, um, it's

53
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,284
called Shit Actually, which is a
play on Love Actually.

54
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:58,224
Um, and it's by Lindy West and
she, she basically

55
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:02,425
just, uh, reviewed old movie
favorites and talked about.

56
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:06,745
Basically like what held up and,
um, you know, what was nonsense?

57
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:10,164
And it was very funny. I, I
laughed out loud on number

58
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:11,034
of times, so that's going to be
my official answer.

59
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:15,165
Ray: And I'm Ray, uh, I'm a data
scientist by training.

60
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:17,955
I've been starting startup
software companies

61
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:22,665
for about 20 years. And I think
the book that

62
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:25,006
had the biggest influence on me
is the Visual

63
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:28,575
Display of Quantitative
Information by Ed Tufty,

64
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:29,866
who was one of my favorite
professors back in college.

65
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,346
Uh, and his book I keep on
returning to his way to better

66
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,806
explain complicated ideas.

67
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:39,496
Dan: Um, I saw a presentation
where they talked about a

68
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:42,195
bunch of stuff from that book.
And I actually like that.

69
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:47,221
Um, A part in there where he, I
think you can correct

70
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,770
me if I'm, if I'm wrong was
talking about, uh, this,

71
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,311
this diagram of Napoleon's like
battle, you know?

72
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:56,911
And, and like, there was like a,
like a very nicely what UX, uh,

73
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:00,540
you know, illustration and, um,
that has like stuck in my brain.

74
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,760
I don't know why it stuck in my
brain. I was probably

75
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,600
like 10 years ago. I had went to
that talk.

76
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,026
Ray: There is marvelous, um, you
know, visualization

77
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:11,086
of complex data that dates back
hundreds of years.

78
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,376
You don't have to do with
computers.

79
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,730
Bekah: That's really cool. I'll
have to check that one out.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,031
Um, so Ray, thanks so much for
being here with us.

81
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:21,430
We're really excited to have you
on the podcast today.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,110
And when we start off, we like
to hear your origin story.

83
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,261
So what got you to this point
where you are here with us?

84
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,940
Ray: Yeah. So, um, coming in
school, um,

85
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:41,940
I was doing social science and a
little too focused on

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,531
the quantitative side of it. So
I was doing more

87
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,250
operations with search as it
related to that.

88
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,771
That sort of led me down the
road to be doing a bit

89
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,961
of management consulting and
working in finance,

90
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,880
actually mortgage finance early
in my career.

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,870
Um, and what I discovered was
that the analytic techniques

92
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,930
I had were kind of limiting. So
I started learning

93
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,711
more coding, right. And learning
how to

94
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,151
develop using the tools
available back in the 1990s.

95
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,810
Uh, and this led me to, you
know, street smarts coding that

96
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,951
I turned into my first, second,
third, fourth businesses.

97
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,100
Um, eventually going from
someone who builds someone,

98
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,471
who's managing people who are
building back to

99
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:21,831
someone who builds again. Um,
it's kind of going back

100
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:25,521
and forth over that, um, until
about 2005 when I was diagnosed

101
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:27,891
with cancer, uh, and then spent
about six months being

102
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:28,821
told that I wouldn't see the end
of that particular year.

103
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,971
Um, and then sort of launched
out with my most recent company

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,661
that I ran for about a decade,
uh, before realizing I was

105
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,600
sort of not really contributing
to it anymore and looking

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,951
for my next thing to do. Um, and
they started a

107
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,211
company and been trying a few
different things.

108
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:50,971
Now I've got a prog studio
going, um, In the course of

109
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,776
this came to the pandemic.
Right. Um, and suddenly

110
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,581
everything

111
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:58,500
changed for everybody and like
the way people

112
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,670
manage the way people work, all
of it is different.

113
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,711
And I had this, um, revelation
that I was

114
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,980
more wrong than I was. Right.
And this is probably

115
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,880
true all the way through. Right.
And we all are.

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,531
Um, but I wanted to kind of
rediscover what it is

117
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:17,100
that people are doing now.
Right. This can project forward,

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,669
as

119
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:21,571
opposed to what I had known and
could project into the past.

120
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,091
Great experiences where
something, but there's

121
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,560
a question to like, where's the
world going?

122
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,980
And I heard about VC, um, and VC
is about people who are entering

123
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,680
the field and figuring out where
they're going to go next.

124
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,040
And so I came here with a
selfish motivation to learn, to

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,850
find out what people are doing.
That's just at variance with

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,180
what I thought was right, or
what I was doing, where a place

127
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,701
where, you know, I knew that I
was more wrong than I was right.

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,706
And I could listen to people,
um, and understand where

129
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:54,136
they're going and hopefully, and
this is sort of thing

130
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:58,576
that I've evolved into, um,
provide some service as well.

131
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:02,175
Right? How can I have a positive
impact on these people's lives,

132
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,995
even as I'm trying to learn from
them so they can have

133
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:07,846
a positive impact on mine. And
that's the feedback

134
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:07,846
that I'm in right now.

135
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:15,415
Dan: Hmm. I love that. I love
the idea of, um, you

136
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:17,216
know, realizing that you're
wrong more than you're right.

137
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,906
You know, and it's the way you
said it is.

138
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:24,706
Like, it makes sense in it. It's
like one of those

139
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:25,435
things that, um, I think you
said this, but.

140
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,625
Everybody in fact is probably
wrong, more often than they're.

141
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,266
Right. You know, but it's, it's
hard

142
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:36,555
to admit that to yourself. Um,
maybe sometimes hard

143
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,906
to, um, I don't know, make, take
action on that. Right.

144
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,605
Uh, other than just like
ignoring, trying to ignore

145
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,706
it, forget about the times that
you were wrong.

146
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:47,985
Um, what, was there something
like, particularly something

147
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,326
aside from just the pandemic and
maybe some of the soul searching

148
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:53,716
that a lot of us went through
that, um, resulted in that.

149
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,475
Realization or revelation as he
put it.

150
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:03,040
Ray: Uh, yeah. Um, I had made a,
a

151
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,141
couple of errors in the course
of 2019 and 2020.

152
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,540
Um, a lot of it having to do
with, uh, who I

153
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,646
would put my faith in. Um, that
was causing me to,

154
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,355
okay, well, what's, what's the
right thing to be doing here.

155
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:17,266
And then that all slams together
with a pandemic, which is

156
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,425
changing lifestyle quite a bit.
Right?

157
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:22,216
So that, you know, this idea of
how I would work of, you

158
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,466
know, go to an office and like
be with people and be

159
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:27,105
leading them with heavy. It's
just different now. Right?

160
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,956
Cause I'm now working remote,
which I appreciate is not as

161
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:33,525
new a thing for many others, but
for small companies are

162
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,966
actually trying to move fast. It
is.

163
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,446
I think more unusual than it's
usual or at least that was

164
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:44,416
true in beginning of 2020. Um,
and the, um, and it was a

165
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:48,046
whole bunch of new things for me
to learn and thing and patterns

166
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:51,405
that just weren't working for me
anymore on an immediate

167
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:53,836
basis, as well as having gotten
a little bit kicked with like

168
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:56,216
who I should be working with.
And, and, and what's a

169
00:08:53,836 --> 00:09:01,096
good basis for trust. Right. So
these were all things I was,

170
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:04,875
uh, sorting out, coming into the
beginning of the pandemic,

171
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:06,346
um, and then figuring out, okay,
what am I doing next?

172
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,836
And then that would eventually
lead me, uh, later in the

173
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:12,975
winter, discover BC and be able
to have the pattern here

174
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,765
even as I was doing that a bit
in my business work, sort

175
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,785
of in the course of the fall.
Does that make sense?

176
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:20,416
Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

177
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:24,025
Bekah: You said this, this
there's this idea of what

178
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:28,135
a good basis for trust. And I'd
like to hear you talk

179
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:32,456
a little bit more about what
you've learned or if there's,

180
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:33,535
if you've kind of narrowed that
down or to find that in any way.

181
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:42,145
Ray: Sure. Um, I think of, I've
learned

182
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:46,166
a couple things about trust. I
think, uh, the first is

183
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:48,206
one needs to accept the idea
that one might be wrong. Right.

184
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,936
Uh, the, the, there's an idea of
a leap of faith, right?

185
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:53,785
You leap and then you kind of
hope there's something I, but

186
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:59,365
you don't have a guarantee. Um,
and I, I think there's

187
00:09:55,375 --> 00:10:01,405
a, there's a bit of, can you
make those leaps a little

188
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,416
smaller, so you don't quite fall
all the way to the bottom

189
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:06,625
of the abyss when it happens.
Um, and so that one

190
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:10,046
can be earning trust. Uh, one of
the neat things about

191
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:13,556
this environment we're in now
being more remote is that people

192
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:14,696
can't really lay the Juju on
you, the way that they could.

193
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,885
Um, if you're just in person,
right?

194
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:21,326
There's a certain presence.
People can have that like

195
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,615
makes you more inclined to
follow them or to trust them.

196
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:25,346
And when you're over this kind
of pipe, that kind of

197
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:28,301
thing, doesn't work as well.
Right. Cause you need to

198
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,910
be more explicit. This both
makes it a little

199
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,650
bit harder to start trust
relationships, but also

200
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,880
makes it hard to start bad trust
relationships.

201
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,471
So that's something I've
definitely seen in terms

202
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:41,020
of how this thing changes. Um,
and the second is that

203
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:44,831
trust well earned takes time.
Um, and I will tell people

204
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,410
who are talking to me about
potential angel investment

205
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:49,691
type things that I only invest
in people that I've

206
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,831
known for over a year. Uh,
because if I haven't known

207
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:57,671
you for a year, I don't really
have that basis of seeing your

208
00:10:53,831 --> 00:11:00,221
consistent behavior there's is a
place I should be putting,

209
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:03,280
you know, the capital that
otherwise is important for

210
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:07,931
the future of my family. You
know? So the, um, so I

211
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:12,655
think those, those. Those those,
those two

212
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:15,056
things have put yourself in a
place where you can trust

213
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,046
and be wrong and not have it be
the end of the world.

214
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:21,056
Um, and then be patient before
you're doing something big,

215
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,985
more, you know, bet the farm
style, um, are the lessons I've

216
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,456
taken away from it at this.

217
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,160
Dan: That's interesting. That's
very interesting.

218
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,441
And Bekah, yes, basically the
question I was going, I

219
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,591
was going to ask it the idea of,
uh, of, I mean, the idea

220
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:40,600
of trust is, um, I don't know
something that's always

221
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,280
important, you know, and I'm,
I'm, I'm, I'm just constantly

222
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,610
fascinated by the ways that, um,
sort of the, the zoom, you

223
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,880
know, culture has like changed,
um, how we communicate and

224
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,091
how we do different things. And
that, that I had never

225
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:02,110
considered this, the, the body
language and the things that

226
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:06,041
people can do to instill trust.
I don't know, in a, in a

227
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,900
fake way, like, there's probably
a better way to

228
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,561
phrase that, but like you were
talking about right.

229
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,500
There's, there's things that
people can do to like physically

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,130
make like, help make a person
trust them, you know, and those

231
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,660
go away when you don't have like
the body language in the room.

232
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,910
And probably, you know, I don't
know, fancy meals and

233
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,770
stuff like that too, I suppose.
But, um, the, the, the, the body

234
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:31,350
language thing has been really
interesting for me because I

235
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,870
I've actually felt, um, I dunno,
uh, some amount of more freedom.

236
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,100
Yeah. In like in zoom, like
locations,

237
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,600
because I don't have to, uh, I
don't have to worry about

238
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:43,510
my body language as much. Right.
I don't have to worry about,

239
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:46,571
uh, you know, talking about
doing presentations that realize

240
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,701
that I don't have to do, I don't
have to worry about,

241
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,581
um, what my hands are doing.
Right. And what I'm doing with

242
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,591
my

243
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,471
hands, what I'm doing with my
legs, how I'm standing

244
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:55,030
or home, you know, whatever. We
can see each other's faces.

245
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,520
I mean, we're right now in most
zoom calls.

246
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,291
Um, so there's still some of
that connection, you

247
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:04,346
know, it's not just the. Like
not just a text chat, but,

248
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:08,186
um, it does remove some of that.
Uh, I dunno, nuance, you

249
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,255
know, for better or worse.
Right. It's, it's really

250
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:09,895
interesting.

251
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:13,196
Ray: The, the tools one can use
to project trust at a

252
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:18,010
difference, or also trust that
distance or also. Right.

253
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:21,341
So for example, what you're
doing, Dan right now with that

254
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,030
bigger microphone that's sitting
in front of you picks up more

255
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:31,660
of your voice timber, right? And
is, um, uh, it is projecting

256
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:35,951
more trustworthiness than
somebody who is just using the

257
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:38,130
microphone on their AirPods.
It's actually one of the

258
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:40,171
reasons why I'm talking into a
microphone right now, I sort

259
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,650
of thought it was a silly thing
to have until I realized how

260
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:47,551
important it was for things like
zoom meetings, um, the

261
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,711
lighting that you've got behind
you, the setup you have, right?

262
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,760
We talk about like room Raider
and, and, and sort

263
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,250
of the silly things along those
lines, but these things

264
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:57,360
help you project trust. So the
tools that we have

265
00:13:54,541 --> 00:14:00,000
that allow us to project trust
through context, as

266
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,855
opposed to just the message. Are
different now

267
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:04,716
than they were before. I tend to
think they're

268
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,785
less potent, right? We don't
have the same aura

269
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:08,765
effect that we can have like
directly in the room,

270
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:11,225
but there are definitely people
who are like super

271
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,725
compelling when they're on TV.
And not that much when

272
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,706
they're in person. Uh, I think
we had a

273
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,426
president who is a little bit on
those lines.

274
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:19,416
Um, and we have, um, different
tools. Now.

275
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,846
We just need to understand how
to put them to work

276
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:25,615
so that we can be getting
maximum value for the things.

277
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:31,125
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And
that, those, like some of

278
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:36,645
those, like the lighting and the
voice stuff, you know, is,

279
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:40,576
that's almost a cosmetic, you
know, trust is kind of like the

280
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:41,926
fake projecting trust stuff that
we were talking about before.

281
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:45,405
Right. Um, and so that goes back
to, I also very much like how

282
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:48,975
you said you to really like, be
able to know for yourself

283
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,375
that you trust somebody it's
like knowing them for a year.

284
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:53,865
Right. Because then it doesn't
matter how fancy.

285
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:57,836
My lighting set up is, you know,
after a year, after a

286
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:01,046
year you'll you'll know whether
or not, um, you can trust me

287
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,605
or anybody else, I suppose.

288
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,010
Bekah: It's interesting as
you're talking about this.

289
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,990
Cause I'm thinking I taught an
argument class, um,

290
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,071
back when I was teaching. And
one of the key things

291
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,240
that we looked at was the
rhetorical triangle.

292
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,480
And so you have like Ethos,
Pathos and Logos, right.

293
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:20,380
And Ethos is that idea of
trustworthiness.

294
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,900
It's the tone and the style of
the person.

295
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:27,806
And so in this digital world,
There has to be this like

296
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:33,625
shortcut way of projecting that.
And in a lot of instances

297
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:34,765
and social media and tech moves
so quickly.

298
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,466
And so what you're saying, these
things that kind of

299
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:41,936
establish that, that allows a
shortcut in order to do that.

300
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,505
And then, you know, Pathos
appeals to emotions and Logos.

301
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:49,015
That's where, you know, you, you
become really credible by.

302
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,291
Showing that you understand what
you're doing, that

303
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,201
you can demonstrate that, you
know, the things that

304
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,510
you're talking about. But I
think that we.

305
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:05,816
We leaned so hard today on Ethos
and Pathos that sometimes that

306
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:10,046
Logos gets lost a little bit. So
rather than really thinking

307
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:13,316
about whether somebody knows
what they're talking

308
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:17,905
about, we think about how we
feel when we hear that

309
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:19,855
person talk, how they appear to
be an authority or not.

310
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:25,015
And I think that tends to lead a
lot of people down a path that

311
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,696
it's not productive or useful.

312
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,971
Ray: Right. I mean, of course in
argumentation, you'll learn

313
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:34,030
that the appeal to authority is
a logical fallacy, right.

314
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,730
It takes you out of the, the
structure of it.

315
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,500
Um, and, and, and I think this
too, to bring it back to the

316
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,215
technology industry, uh it's
this is complicated stuff.

317
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,930
Right.

318
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,341
The code that you're looking at,
the, uh, the, the nature

319
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:53,471
of things we're trying to build
or edit or create, um,

320
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,461
are just very hard to hold.
Right to hold your head

321
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,990
directly, but not simple systems
even have a mental model of it.

322
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,780
So at a comp at a, a complicated
system level

323
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,790
is, is really difficult. And so
you wind up with,

324
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,345
okay, I have an edge of it.
Right. And how do I trust in

325
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,630
that

326
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:14,891
edge and how I trust in the edge
the other person has.

327
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,681
And that's a, that's a tough
thing because

328
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:22,601
you just don't know. Um, and you
don't know because

329
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:25,500
none of us, or very few of us, I
would say are smart

330
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:29,641
enough to actually hold it in.
So, how do you, how do you,

331
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:32,641
how do you build the trust that
like the sure you're holding

332
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:33,871
onto leg of the elephant and
they're holding onto the trunk?

333
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,480
Um, are you actually
communicating with each

334
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,070
other so you can put together
the floor picture?

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,230
Bekah: Yeah. And it's
interesting.

336
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,830
This concept of trust and how
important it is on our

337
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,681
journeys and our paths, but also
how it impacts

338
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:52,990
how we trust ourselves too.
Because a lot of times I think

339
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,351
that when we think about how we
trust ourselves, we do it based

340
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:59,711
on other people's perceptions of
us or our interactions with

341
00:17:56,351 --> 00:18:04,270
those people that we do trust.
And so when you get into a

342
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:08,201
situation where, you know,
you're following someone or,

343
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:14,260
or working with somebody who
isn't really trustworthy, And

344
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:18,881
that impacts your ability to see
what path you could be

345
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,141
on or what your potential is.
Does that make sense?

346
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:27,895
Ray: Yeah. Um, the right people
to advise

347
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:29,996
us and to be our lightposts is,
is a hard and important thing.

348
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:34,615
Um, and I think, you know, one
of the things I conversations

349
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,185
sometimes have with
entrepreneurs is their reticence

350
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:42,506
to commit to a path, right? Like
they're afraid

351
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:45,536
they're are more afraid of being
wrong than they are

352
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:50,996
excited about being right. Um,
and there's an expression

353
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:52,016
that more was lost by indecision
than by the wrong decision.

354
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:56,695
Um, and the, there there's an
opportunity to be just giving

355
00:18:56,695 --> 00:19:00,955
people some more confidence. Not
that they should

356
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,726
follow your advice, right? Not
that you should do the

357
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:04,526
thing that I say you should do,
but that you should do.

358
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,371
Right. That you should go
forward with

359
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,391
that, which makes sense for you.
Um, and that you have a trust

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,951
in them that they can then apply
that trust to themselves.

361
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,791
There's a guy named  Simon
Sinek. Uh, he wrote a book

362
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,361
called,

363
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,971
uh, called, um, Start With Why.
And he actually has a

364
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:23,230
famous Ted talk too. I don't
know if

365
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:27,580
you've ever seen it. Um, and he
talks about three

366
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,951
levels of, of what you're about.
He says the inside is the

367
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:31,740
why then around that you have
the, how then around

368
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,631
that you have the what. Right.
And you've got lots of whats.

369
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,931
You might have a few hows, but
have one why, what does the

370
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:43,191
thing that really motivates you?
And to the extent that we can

371
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:46,131
help people find their why.
Right. W what, what is the

372
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:48,980
important thing to them? Then
they're in a position where

373
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,931
they can be making important
decisions, the hows, right.

374
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:53,391
That are long-term decisions
that allow them to move

375
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,901
forward, as opposed to being,
you know, like we started

376
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:57,861
afraid of being wrong.

377
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,891
Dan: Yeah, I love that. I, that
indecision thing

378
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:06,080
is, is real, you know? And it's,
I think it's like

379
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:08,540
everybody is everybody's
affected by it, you

380
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,871
know, from time to time. Um, so
like, it kind of

381
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,556
talks about how you can. People,
what do you do when

382
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:18,276
you find yourself in that
situation of, you know, it

383
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:20,435
kind of stuck, maybe your
motivations are a little

384
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:22,715
different, you know, from case
to case, but like you're stuck

385
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:26,165
in decision, you know, you're,
you're, um, I don't know, lost

386
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:28,625
or whatever, like what do you do
personally, if you're, if

387
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:28,625
you're in a situation like that,

388
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,476
Ray: Well, it helps have people
you trust to

389
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:36,165
be able to talk about. Right.
Um, I think Bekah, you and

390
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:40,125
I had a conversation where I use
the expression believable

391
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:42,135
people, um, and that, that comes
from um Ray Dailo.

392
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,961
Um, who uses it in the context
of, he actually

393
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,421
has a whole app based on
believability that he uses for

394
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:50,151
decision-making over at his, a
hedge fund called Bridgewater.

395
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:55,401
Um, and who is believable in a
given context, matters a lot.

396
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,111
Now, if you're not sure who to
trust, that's a

397
00:20:57,111 --> 00:21:00,070
whole different thing. But if he
has some people

398
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:02,661
who you can trust, who you can
go back to who are

399
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,151
believable, uh, and this is
something you accumulate

400
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:07,060
over a lifetime, right? Go back
to them and ask.

401
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,310
And what I have found in the
course of having those

402
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,671
conversations is that there is
two kinds of value.

403
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,911
The first kind of value is that
these people who I

404
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,490
trust will listen to what I'm
saying about that.

405
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,530
And then will feed that back to
me, right?

406
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,230
Feedback a, you know, their,
their, their, their opinion on

407
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,891
the situation or what have you.
But the second thing, and

408
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,361
this takes some training. But
the second thing

409
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:30,891
that I've learned to do is to
listen to myself.

410
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:35,740
The very thing that I'm saying
to them is most often.

411
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,141
At least implies the answer of
what I need to do now.

412
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,191
Um, and I gotta say, like, when
I'm talking to entrepreneurs

413
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,020
who are doing a one-off thing,
like we've done this before,

414
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,590
actually in the, um, in the
Indi, uh, startup hacker meetup,

415
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,941
um, I sort of listened to what
someone's saying about their

416
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:56,060
situation for about 10 minutes.
And then I kind of

417
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:56,990
repeat it back to them using
different words.

418
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,760
They say, wow, that's such great
advice.

419
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,651
I've really only been repeating
it back to them.

420
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,230
Um, but that can be worth a lot
too.

421
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,090
I mean, th th there's, there's
such a thing as the

422
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,230
value of a sounding board. Um,
and being able to just

423
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,901
listen to yourself can be one of
the hardest things

424
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,010
to do, but that can be the job
of your best friend.

425
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:17,625
Dan: Yeah, I love that. So this
is like rubber

426
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:20,675
ducking, except for not. Tech
stuff. Right. Almost right.

427
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,855
You know? So, so like rubber
ducking in

428
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:27,155
tech, I guess when you're stuck
on a bug or something as you,

429
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:31,145
and I explained to somebody or,
or, you know, or an object,

430
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:33,786
the, what you're trying to do.
And then sometimes the answer

431
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:35,375
becomes clear to yourself. Um,
just based on that, right.

432
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:37,506
Ray: rubber ducking your life.

433
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:37,951
Dan: Yeah.

434
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,346
Ray: And now you have a podcast
title.

435
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:40,980
Bekah: Okay.

436
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,401
Dan: I love that

437
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,171
Bekah: Okay.

438
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,911
Dan: concept of rubber ducking.
Most of the time in a tech,

439
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:50,921
um, context and, you know, a
development context, but.

440
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:56,145
A lot. Um, and in Virtual Coffee
and,

441
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:58,236
and in our, um, and in the
podcast, I feel like it's, it's

442
00:22:56,145 --> 00:23:00,395
made a, it's made a number of
appearances that rubber duck,

443
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:02,645
we got a picture of Drew's. Drew
has a, you know,

444
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:03,336
actual rubber duck. He sits on
his desk.

445
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,826
We got a picture of him cause he
was holding it up

446
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,256
and talking to it during the
podcast episode that he was on.

447
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:10,385
And when you did get a shot of
it.

448
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,925
So I got a shot of it for the,
for the show notes.

449
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:17,036
Um, I like that. I like that
idea though.

450
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:20,195
Just that finding that, that
trusted person, you

451
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:21,185
know, that can kind of.

452
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,391
Bekah: So there. Especially in
tech, when we have

453
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:36,050
so many people who are working
remotely or who are self-taught,

454
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:40,790
there can be a lot of isolation
and there sometimes can be a

455
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:42,411
really hard, it can be hard to
find that soundboard right.

456
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,570
Hard to find the people you
trust.

457
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,590
So what advice do you have for
people who are

458
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,465
in the situation where. That
would be really great

459
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:55,806
if I had somebody that I trusted
and can talk to, you

460
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,806
know, how do you get to that?

461
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:58,952
Ray: Well, it's a hard thing,
right?

462
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,873
I, I, it's not going to be
automatic.

463
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,063
I would say that if you've met
somebody in Virtual

464
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:07,323
Coffee, that's not the person,
um, because you don't have

465
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:12,272
nearly enough depth, right. To
have that kind of, you

466
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:17,242
know, soul bearing trust. Um,
and. This is where a family

467
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:19,432
has become helpful. This is
where a childhood

468
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:22,042
friends can become helpful to
the extent that you keep up

469
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:24,532
with any, um, this is where
people in your community

470
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:26,932
can become helpful, right? This
is where you have that

471
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:28,042
kind of depth, uh, that doesn't
need to come from work.

472
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,923
And I think one of the things
people think is that they

473
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:34,313
need to talk to somebody who's
in the context, right.

474
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:37,742
That they are talking about.
But, you know,

475
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:40,163
particularly talking about. It
could be a rubber duck, right?

476
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:44,782
So it could be your, you know,
it could be a minister.

477
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,752
It could be, you know, an aunt,
it could be, you know,

478
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,393
whoever it is that, that, that
is important to you

479
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:54,732
in your life, who you would
trust to not repeat it. Right.

480
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,712
The things that are bothering
you the most, it's really

481
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,452
the confidence that's going to
be most important when

482
00:24:58,452 --> 00:25:01,722
we talk about that trust and
then allowing that

483
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:07,212
reflection to, um, to happen. So
if a combination of

484
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:10,153
non-repeating and ideally not
carrying the, the, uh,

485
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:13,182
the judgment of it too far
forward, that can be hard

486
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:14,502
to find in a work context. Um,
and I wouldn't look.

487
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:19,202
Casually, uh, it should. And it
accumulates over

488
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:21,063
time, someone you met on Virtual
Coffee two years ago

489
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:23,133
that you've been keeping up with
and have now a deeper

490
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:25,502
relationship with that could be
a thing, but of course, Virtual

491
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,502
Coffee isn't even that old.

492
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:27,978
Dan: More over a year though,
right?

493
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:31,682
Ray: Oh yeah. Over a year. I can
invest in somebody

494
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:35,647
Bekah: those listening, you just
got to wait literally like

495
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:38,917
another five months and then you
can have your rubber duck.

496
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:41,978
Dan: Um, you mentioned

497
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,113
Ray: There's also a thing.
Sorry, just one last idea.

498
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:47,083
There is such a thing called a
Mastermind, uh, which

499
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:51,073
is a, uh, structure first
introduced back in the 1930s.

500
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:53,803
It was something that Henry Ford
did, uh, that was in written

501
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,522
up in a book by Napoleon hill.
And it's actually pretty popular

502
00:25:55,363 --> 00:26:02,623
in the startup community right
now, um, which is just in

503
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:03,643
agreement among a few people who
are all doing the same thing.

504
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:06,192
In this case, startup founders,
uh, that was

505
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:09,948
said in the room stays. And
usually they're

506
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,208
coming in with the biggest
business blockers.

507
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,698
What have you, and most of the
time it is the same kind of

508
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,827
phenomenon we just talked about
that applies to anything else.

509
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,948
So, you know, I sort of talked
about, Hey, you need to have

510
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:22,157
this depth of, you know, um,
what have you, in order to,

511
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:28,008
uh, be the basis of that trust.
But there is some indication

512
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:32,268
that you could decide to do this
with a structure and an

513
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:36,077
agreement ahead of time and a
little bit of, um, peer

514
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:36,887
pressure that says, Hey, because
we're doing this as a small.

515
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,248
We're all agreeing that what's
said in the

516
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:42,607
room stays in the room. So
there, I think there's,

517
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:46,268
there, there is definitely
potential for being able to

518
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:49,657
provide that kind of con uh, uh,
counsel in confidence,

519
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:51,607
not from someone wiser than you,
but at least someone

520
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:51,607
who you trust not to repeat.

521
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,782
Dan: Well, and I, and a group of
people. Right.

522
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:56,938
Ray: Yeah. And the small group
seems to

523
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:57,147
be where the magic of that is.
Yeah.

524
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:00,232
Dan: with, with the masterminds
concept.

525
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:04,492
Um, w in those cases, in at
least the ones you've seen

526
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,732
are those people who have a
history, like a relationship

527
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:13,252
already, or are they sort of
like for like minded people,

528
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:15,772
but not necessarily know each
other yet, you know,

529
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:19,448
Ray: The two that I've done have
both been in the category.

530
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:20,887
We were strangers at the
beginning of it.

531
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:21,307
Dan: Yeah,

532
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:25,147
Ray: Uh, and frankly, that was
part of the benefit, right?

533
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:28,147
That, you know, we, we had the,
um, you know, the, the false

534
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,228
confidence of anonymity, right.
Uh, that, Hey, we could all

535
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:35,048
leave and maybe it didn't work
out and it's not like we'll run

536
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:37,567
into those people again, because
the world is big and, you know,

537
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:39,458
no matter what your business is,
is your is probably relatively

538
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:41,587
small compared to the world. Um,
so there there's.

539
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:45,053
There's definitely an
opportunity to be starting

540
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,813
a little bit more for cold. I
mean, I know I said like the

541
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:50,093
whole two year thing, what have
you, but that's my experience

542
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:52,313
on the one-on-one and this
mastermind thing is something

543
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:54,712
I've only experienced much more
recently, but I think it's a

544
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:58,373
way maybe to be able to get that
jump-started, um, and

545
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:59,512
could be interesting, even at
the level of a VC initiative,

546
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,982
Dan: Yeah. I mean, I definitely,
like, I like the idea a

547
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,343
lot, you know, it's, it's an
interesting concept.

548
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:10,153
Um, and we have found in Virtual
Coffee, the like value

549
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:15,903
of small groups, you know, um,
just in general, right. And

550
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:16,077
Ray: Okay.

551
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:19,032
Dan: just being able to talk
and, you know, in small rooms

552
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,603
and break rooms and things like
that, um, it, it seems

553
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:28,567
like one of the highlights of.
Dunno our experience or

554
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:31,268
whatever, our, uh, mission, I
don't know, whatever, whatever

555
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:35,617
the word is, but, you know, uh,
th th this sort of intimacy of,

556
00:28:31,468 --> 00:28:35,617
of, of something like that, um,

557
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:39,327
Ray: I'd use the word way.
There's a Virtual Coffee way.

558
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:40,998
Dan: the way, yes, this is the
way

559
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:41,472
Bekah: Yeah.

560
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:48,198
Dan: a man, a man, sorry, I just
got sidetracked

561
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:49,548
by the Mandalorian. So,

562
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:51,097
Bekah: I have a

563
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:51,857
Dan: yeah, go.

564
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:57,938
Bekah: Okay. So if say you're
working with

565
00:28:52,508 --> 00:29:01,567
a small group of people in some
capacity that we talked

566
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:06,577
about in this conversation and.
You can kind of see a path

567
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:08,887
that would, maybe you, can't
kind of like you are pretty,

568
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:11,407
have a pretty strong feeling
that you can see a path for

569
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:15,067
this person in front of you. And
you're trying to guide

570
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:17,198
them in that direction. And
maybe this is wrong.

571
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:19,538
Maybe you're like, no, you don't
try and guide anyone.

572
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,067
You help them get there
themselves.

573
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,617
But what I'm trying to get at is
like, sometimes people

574
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:26,768
just can not see that path or
they're very resistant to that

575
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:33,188
path and they refuse to try it.
So, you know, how do you, how

576
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:36,698
do you navigate that situation
where you're trying to help

577
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:43,117
somebody find the right path for
themselves or, um, you

578
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:45,048
know, the thing that, that, you
know, would be really good for.

579
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,222
Ray: I'm wrong more often than
I'm right.

580
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,732
I don't know what the right path
for them is.

581
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:56,323
Um, I think I used to give, you
know, that kind of, um,

582
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:02,022
didactic  advice more freely and
I've, uh, I've been

583
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:06,823
beaten back by that a bit. Um,
you know, I think cancer

584
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:09,282
did that a bit to me, just sort
of the experience of like, you

585
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:11,442
know, being an entrepreneur,
figuring out what works and what

586
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:14,952
doesn't has put that into me.
Um, and having, and

587
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:18,252
getting to be in groups of
people, uh, VC included,

588
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:23,127
uh, that are not like me. Right.
Has also helps with my humility

589
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:24,417
and to the extent that I can
keep building on my humility.

590
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,867
I think I'm going to be much
better off when I see people

591
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,117
in that kind of situation where
I think that they

592
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:37,188
are running into a wall. The
thing I've learned is

593
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:38,567
to don't say it, oh no, don't
run into the wall.

594
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:41,468
Actually. I just had this
conversation

595
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:43,907
with them, an entrepreneur, um,
an email back and forth what

596
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:48,498
someone who I'm invested in, um,
who by the way is, uh, at

597
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:51,857
risk of running into the wall.
Um, and I wrote this whole

598
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:53,298
note out saying, look, man,
you're running into the wall

599
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,107
that you're, you're, you're
going to run out of money.

600
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:57,048
This is going to be a problem.
You know, I can hear your

601
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:59,127
number to dah, dah, dah. And
then I sort of re-read it.

602
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:02,387
And, uh, and this is something
that my wife says I'm good at.

603
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:05,708
I threw away the email and I
wrote another one

604
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:10,327
and I wrote the email. That was,
why are you doing this?

605
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,298
What was the reason you started
down this journey?

606
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:18,998
And what's important about it.
Uh, and how can you find

607
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:21,127
what's important to be focusing
your attention

608
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:25,272
on the stuff that matters? And
not be spending on the stuff

609
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:28,992
that doesn't matter to you. And
here are like the five other

610
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:30,103
people who are really smart, who
are sitting on your board.

611
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:34,063
These are wonderful resources,
go talk to them for what's next.

612
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:36,252
Right. And they might give more
didactic advice.

613
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:39,883
But like my thing was just a,
how can I help this person

614
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,462
rediscover why they were there
in the first place?

615
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:45,837
And if I can do that, Then I can
put them on the tracks game.

616
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,478
The answers can be right for
them instead of

617
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:51,718
the particular policy. I think
might've

618
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,718
been right for me.

619
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:58,336
Dan: I love that. I love that
that's an experience

620
00:31:54,006 --> 00:32:01,236
I have to sometimes where I
write something out sometime

621
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:03,756
I guess, I suppose most of the
time it's some sort of

622
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:10,826
snarky tweet, you know, or a
reply or something, but,

623
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:16,455
um, you know, the, initial. You
are clearly wrong, you know,

624
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:19,036
whatever, like what you're doing
would feel wrong for me, that,

625
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:22,125
that, like that idea, you know,
and not, you know, not trying

626
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:24,826
to put it on to somebody else.
Um, and just the action

627
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:25,905
of throwing away, the writing it
out, I suppose.

628
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:29,026
It's probably helpful for you,
you to reprocess, but, you know,

629
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:32,895
throwing it out and then kind of
reframing it as, uh, as a here's

630
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:36,736
some things to think about.
Right. Um, it's gotta be more

631
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:38,955
helpful most of the time, uh, to
the people.

632
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,590
Although, I mean, not although,
but like even if probably

633
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:45,361
sometimes people are asking
questions, so hoping for some

634
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:50,671
sort of easy answer, you know,
um, I think the, the, the

635
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,861
answers, the kind of answers
that you provide, that, that

636
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:56,490
you've provided to me over over
the last year, um, are, are

637
00:32:56,671 --> 00:33:00,151
ultimately much more helpful
even if, no matter how much

638
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:01,951
I beg you, you won't just tell
me exactly what to do.

639
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,480
Uh, I just like, I love that
approach.

640
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,351
I appreciate it very much.

641
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,955
Bekah: But also sometimes it
would be nice to

642
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,185
know what should I do?

643
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:18,266
Dan: Okay. Uh, yeah, for our
listeners,

644
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:21,566
I be like, Ray is infinitely
patient with us, both Bekah

645
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:26,336
and I individually and probably
together have come to Ray

646
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:28,465
for advice a million times. I
don't, I don't know

647
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:29,905
how many times, and it's always
been good.

648
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:32,846
And, and this approach, I never
really put it in words, but

649
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:39,945
this is approach is exactly why.
You know, it's that, that

650
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:43,336
process of, um, reframing
things, probably just re

651
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:45,976
spitting out the things that I
said to him, you know,

652
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:47,296
but, uh, in a more connected
manner, um, I don't know.

653
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,226
I, I, something that I
appreciate personally very much.

654
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:57,165
Bekah: Yeah, same. And I know
Ray also has been

655
00:33:53,415 --> 00:34:01,816
running two of our small groups
at Virtual Coffee, the Indie

656
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:03,496
Hackers Group and the React.
What's the full name

657
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:03,496
of the React group?

658
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,250
Ray: I called a group mentoring
actually, after

659
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,391
your idea from April.

660
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,360
Dan: okay.

661
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:13,405
Bekah: So the Group Mentoring.
And so I know that there've

662
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:16,315
been a lot of people who have
benefited from that, and I

663
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:18,655
always forget the day and
usually schedule something

664
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:23,306
else at the same time. So I
haven't been able to make

665
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:29,155
as much, but as I've wanted to.
But when you are moving in

666
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:32,715
these different groups or. If
you're meeting with

667
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:36,465
someone individually or you're
talking to an investor, is

668
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:39,045
there a standard approach that
you kind of take going

669
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:43,365
into those situations? Are you
really like looking at

670
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:47,835
the person in that moment every
time and trying to figure out

671
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:49,606
how you can both learn and learn
from and support that person?

672
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:54,188
Ray: So there's something that
in my own head, I called the Dr.

673
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:59,918
House Rule. Um, which is, uh,
which is after

674
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:03,998
a TV show is on decade ago. Um,
uh, where is a medical

675
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:08,768
version of Sherlock Holmes? And
the, the, the premise is

676
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:11,047
that if you've gone to the ER
and they can't figure out

677
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:12,458
what's going on and they take
you to a specialist and they

678
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:14,047
can't figure out what's going
on, they then bring you to Dr.

679
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,887
House, which means that every
time I'm talking with somebody.

680
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,878
Is actually talking with me
about their problem.

681
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:24,588
Uh, it must be not that
receptive right.

682
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,717
To easy answers. Right. Cause
you would have gotten them.

683
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:32,112
Um, and, and so that's the
reason, it's one of the reasons

684
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:33,623
I take the approach that I do.
Right.

685
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:39,322
Which is, um, you know, try to
discover what's going on inside.

686
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:43,043
You know, there's this idea in
systems theory, um, that,

687
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,713
uh, in a complex system, like an
ecological system,

688
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:49,543
um, both the problem and the
answer are inside the system.

689
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:54,503
So trying to apply resource from
outside the system is often

690
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:58,402
kind of destructive, right? So
there's like an example

691
00:35:56,273 --> 00:36:00,833
of like, if you were in
Bangladesh and this time too,

692
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:04,132
and you're, you're looking at
poverty, um, there's one

693
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:06,143
theory of, well, let's go bring
a factory to town, right.

694
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:08,213
We'll be able to arbitrage the
labor.

695
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:11,083
It will, uh, we'll, we'll raise
people's living standards

696
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,632
and, and that'll all be good.
Um, but then when you

697
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:16,342
look there, there's like plenty
of economy down. Right.

698
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:19,882
They just don't have quite
enough, um, liquidity going on.

699
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,913
And so th there was a guy who I
should think won the peace

700
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,452
prize for this who came up with
the idea of micro loans.

701
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:29,722
Which is to create financial
opportunities, not by having

702
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,793
a big factory come to town.
Right.

703
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:35,213
But just to enable these people
to do transactions among each

704
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:39,742
other, and then by greasing the
gears of commerce, allow them

705
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:43,572
to make each other's, um, may
make each other wealthier and

706
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:48,628
raise the overall standards. The
answer wasn't to

707
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:49,978
come in from the outside with a
big new factory.

708
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:52,137
It was just to enable what's on
the inside.

709
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,648
And I think that applies in
systems as big as Bangladesh

710
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,248
and as small as, a human being.

711
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:04,826
Dan: I love that idea. I don't
really have anything

712
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:06,985
to add to it or, or, or to delve
in, but this

713
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:09,925
is one of those moments. We have
these in the podcast

714
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:13,976
where we, something that guests
says just kind of like Bekah

715
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:17,576
and I are, both just like
processing it, you know, uh,

716
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:22,646
galaxy brand kind of moments
that, um, that I dunno, I

717
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:22,976
don't have anything to say.
Really.

718
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,626
That was a very good answer.

719
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,300
Bekah: I would like a three hour
conversation on that.

720
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,800
Can we, can we schedule an
evening lecture as well

721
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,068
Dan: so, all right, so I'm going
to go back a little bit

722
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:42,869
to the, to the interest groups.
Um, they you've been, you know,

723
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:48,568
running, um, and I guess, I
guess my, you know, the indie

724
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:50,159
hackers group, um, is sort of a
group of like-minded people.

725
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,159
It's almost close to the
masterminds thing, although,

726
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,978
although it's not like a
specific group of people. Right.

727
00:37:55,978 --> 00:38:00,384
But it's, you know, um, Um, the
people that join the meetup

728
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:04,103
are kind of all on their own
journeys of, you know, indie

729
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:09,983
hacking and stuff like that. And
we kind of all talk and

730
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:13,043
give advice and, um, and Ray
kind of moves people through

731
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:14,333
the, you know, discussions, um,
which has been cool.

732
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:19,434
Uh, the, the react group
mentoring it's, it's, it's a

733
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,733
little bit different, right?
This is, this is a, this is

734
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:24,534
a meetup where there's people
who are, um, learning react.

735
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:27,744
Or, or have learned it and are
working in it.

736
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,324
And then there's people who have
been, had some more

737
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:32,543
experience with it that hang out
a little bit together.

738
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:35,753
Um, can you talk a little bit
about like your ideas about

739
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:37,974
that group and how it's, how it
is, like, how it started,

740
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:41,034
how it's been going, you know, w
what what's been good about

741
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,704
it what's been, if there, if
anything bad about it.

742
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:49,733
Ray: Yeah, well, um, I would
look to the participants

743
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,974
to answer the question of what's
been good or bad.

744
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:56,063
Um, Luma I'm I'm, I'm running
the groups through

745
00:38:56,213 --> 00:39:00,173
Luma as a platform. Um, and what
this does again,

746
00:38:57,684 --> 00:39:02,364
to ask for people's feedback and
the feedback I've gotten

747
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:05,184
so far has been in the quality
of, you know, five stars and

748
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:09,503
then nothing in the comment box.
Uh, and while I appreciate the

749
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:11,034
kind stars, like knowing what
people value would help me.

750
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:14,893
Um, both get more out of it, uh,
as well as help

751
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:19,364
others get more out of it. So to
the extent that I can

752
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:23,324
be, uh, using this podcast as a
request for comment, uh, I

753
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:25,454
would, um, you know, I've been
doing this since April, once

754
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:28,543
again, I think out of what was
it called the month of

755
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:30,523
month of sharing was that was
whatever the challenge was.

756
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:31,813
That was sort of what inspired
me to start

757
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:36,224
these two little meetups. Um,
and the, the thing

758
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:39,853
I really liked about the react
meetup is the ability

759
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:43,224
to just connect people. Right.
Like, there've been a couple

760
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:45,864
of them where like, maybe for
half of them I'm talking or

761
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:48,744
something, but the best ones for
me, those are the ones

762
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:51,534
where I'm talking barely at all.
I am just keeping the

763
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:54,534
conversation, moving between
smart people, commenting

764
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:58,494
on somebody's problem. And it
can be very cool when

765
00:39:55,253 --> 00:40:02,333
it's like you Dan, or it's going
to be Ryan or Kirk, you

766
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:03,264
know, uh, talking smart about a
problem that somebody has.

767
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:06,759
But the thing that is just
revelatory  to me is when

768
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,789
it's someone who's not one of
you who is, who is themselves

769
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:12,699
relatively junior, or perceive
themselves to be junior and

770
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:17,813
they are helping each other.
Because the problem you have

771
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:18,684
is just the problem that's
directly in front of you.

772
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:20,724
And it's strange to you, but it
might not be

773
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:24,204
strange to someone else. And
that's not a question

774
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:27,384
of being junior or senior or up
the ladder or progressive

775
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:30,414
that's just context. And when I
can have people

776
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:32,813
of different contexts come
together and make each other

777
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:33,773
smarter, and then they come out
and they are greater.

778
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,514
Uh, that's the mission.

779
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:40,353
Dan: Yeah, that's great. I, I've
also enjoyed

780
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:43,134
those times, you know, and I,
uh, It's funny.

781
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:46,673
I try, you know, as, as a
participant in the meetup, I do

782
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:51,143
try, like, I try to, I mean, I
love react and I love coding,

783
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:53,003
you know, and I get very excited
about all that, you know?

784
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,244
Uh, and so I try to, I try to,
um, get people

785
00:40:56,244 --> 00:41:00,833
engaged in all that stuff. Um,
and it's just, uh, it's

786
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:03,384
always funny cause I'm sure Ray
can see me just getting

787
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:08,724
really, really antsy sometimes,
you know, Somebody asked about,

788
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:10,373
uh, you know, CSS and tailwind
and, you know, CSS and JS. And

789
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:15,623
there was, there was some really
good discussion, really, really,

790
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:21,353
really good, um, discussion. And
I was just like literally

791
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:23,393
sitting on my, on my hands.
Cause, cause it's like,

792
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,934
I've been doing CSS for a
million years.

793
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,844
Old guy opinions about it
probably.

794
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:31,074
But, uh, I mean, that's just my
personal anecdote about it.

795
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:34,253
Um, the, the, the, the meetup
has been really fun and I've

796
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:37,224
been, I've been really thinking
about different ways that it can

797
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:41,273
be, you know, if for instance,
more people start joining or,

798
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:45,443
you know, if it gets bigger, you
know, ways to, um, kind of

799
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:48,954
keep it going with the intimacy
it has, you know, so it's like

800
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:52,244
so far, it's been most of the
time, what like eight to 10.

801
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:54,534
People does that sound right

802
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:56,934
Ray: Yeah, there are 20 plus
less two of them.

803
00:41:57,173 --> 00:41:58,764
Dan: Oh, okay. Nice. Well, I
missed the last one.

804
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:02,063
So, um, yeah, 20 plus is a, is
a, that's like a solid

805
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:07,164
amount of people for, for kind
of a, um, meet up like that.

806
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:09,173
And it's, you know, um, I don't
know.

807
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:12,563
It's, it's very cool. And it's a
very cool,

808
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:16,614
uh, service that you're
providing to the community

809
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:17,514
and to like the people and
honestly, the meet you.

810
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:18,954
I mean, I learned things
watching.

811
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,478
Um, watching other people go
through these as well.

812
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:27,009
Um, lots of times there was the,
uh, I don't know which one it

813
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:30,548
was awhile ago or somebody was
working through authentication

814
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:35,498
and, you know, react hooks. And,
um, and I think as a

815
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:38,708
group, we all just decided, like
we had run a little bit

816
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:41,228
longer on, on that problem, but
we all wanted to see, you

817
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,918
know, we all wanted to see the
outcome and get through it.

818
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:45,309
So we all kind of sat as a group
and cut through the whole thing,

819
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:50,849
you know, and it was great. Um,
I don't know, I just,

820
00:42:46,728 --> 00:42:53,969
I just appreciated it, you know,
as, as, as a consumer,

821
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:55,559
even as a, as a group member,
um, it was, it was very cool.

822
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:59,188
Um, that's all just to say, I
appreciate the work

823
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:00,869
you've been doing on it, and I
appreciate that, that,

824
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,449
uh, that meetup group has been,
it's been really cool.

825
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:05,923
Ray: Well, for anyone interested
in participating they're

826
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:08,233
on the second and fourth
Wednesdays of the month at

827
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:11,264
1 PM, central as 1 PM. Eastern.
Oh, got that one wrong.

828
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:16,594
Dan: Hmm. Yes. Yes. And, uh,
the, if you're

829
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:19,344
in our slack, the help and
pairing they're usually

830
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:21,594
links are posted there too. Um,
and help and

831
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:23,813
pairing a channel. So definitely
check those out.

832
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:26,094
Uh, if you're interested in
react.

833
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:28,706
Bekah: So when you're talking
about all of these

834
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,137
different things that you do,
I'm trying to.

835
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:35,007
Think about it in terms of
mentorship.

836
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:38,547
And I'm wondering if you think
about it in terms of

837
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:41,847
mentorship, because it seems,
you know, uh, maybe a little

838
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:46,317
bit different than the way that
we understand or traditionally

839
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:46,976
think of mentoring.

840
00:43:49,411 --> 00:43:54,661
Ray: Yeah. I think a mentorship
as

841
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:55,621
being a, um, a relatively
intense relationship.

842
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,152
Relatively high trust on both
sides.

843
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,342
That's a nontrivial time
commitment.

844
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:04,661
Um, uh, and I find that the best
model is one that actually

845
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:09,422
came from a guy named Bob Mesta.
Um, and he, he wrote about it in

846
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:12,282
the Harvard business review too.
And, um, and, and

847
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:14,472
his approach is it's. He, he, he
structured

848
00:44:12,612 --> 00:44:18,262
them as 90 day programs. Um,
where he is going to

849
00:44:15,472 --> 00:44:20,751
work with somebody who's, you
know, looking to make

850
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:21,681
a particular kind of change in
their life, right?

851
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:24,052
Want to move from phase to phase
B on something.

852
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,632
And he's there to help them make
that change.

853
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:28,731
And he's measuring himself based
on their, his success

854
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:32,001
and helping them make that. And
he measures the other

855
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:34,552
person based on their commitment
to making that

856
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:35,692
thing happen as well. It doesn't
need to be

857
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:39,072
all the work on it. Right. It's
not trying to maximize

858
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:40,481
the change is trying to move
from one state to another.

859
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:42,931
And I find that to be a sort of
a useful way of looking at

860
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:47,291
right equate to create limits.
Uh, I found that to be really

861
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:49,152
good for masterminds too. Right.
There's a, what's the

862
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:50,081
change you're looking to make in
the next quarter.

863
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:53,442
And then we're committing to
meeting weekly, right.

864
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:55,512
To be helping each other, make
that. Right.

865
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:58,541
Um, so when you have something
that's going to

866
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:01,902
be a more intensive kind of
commitment, knowing what

867
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:05,141
does success look like? And
what's that? What does the

868
00:45:03,731 --> 00:45:08,442
commitment of resource? Um, I
think matters

869
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:11,172
matters quite a bit. And a lot
of, you know,

870
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:12,492
the things I tried to do here, I
try to be helpful.

871
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,742
Um, but again, I try to be
humble. Right?

872
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,981
I am learning as much, if not
more from this.

873
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:21,882
Uh, then this group is
potentially gaining from me

874
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:24,371
and I understand that that is a
value I'm receiving

875
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:25,722
and that I'm grateful for.

876
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:30,974
Dan: Yeah, that that value
proposition of being in a

877
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:33,824
community, um, is always an
interesting one to think

878
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:36,375
about too, you know, as somebody
who's, you know,

879
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:42,514
you said, and I agree that. The
Virtual Coffee has a lot of

880
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:45,184
people who are career changing,
you know, starting their

881
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:51,445
careers and things like that.
And then, um, some members

882
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:53,434
who are, are more senior, but,
you know, been around

883
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:58,534
for a while longer, um, not
changing careers, you know,

884
00:45:53,434 --> 00:46:02,849
uh, and that how to provide
value as a community to

885
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:06,000
more senior members, senior
developer, IE members, um, has

886
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,019
been something that we've we
thought about from time to time.

887
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,449
Um, and that's, for me, that's
the, that's

888
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:13,679
the same answer as is. I've just
like learned, I've

889
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:18,360
learned so much from everybody,
you know, I learned about, um,

890
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:22,139
how a lot of my assumptions, you
know, can be wrong, you

891
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,360
know, learn about, um, how
people learn, like all the

892
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:30,974
different ways that people learn
things, you know,

893
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:31,445
in general, um, It's it's. It's
cool.

894
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,474
That the way you phrase it, I,
I, um, I really appreciate that.

895
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:35,985
That's cool.

896
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:39,338
Bekah: You know, I, I think, you
know, one of the things that

897
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:44,454
I would like to know about if,
if you okay, I think I asked

898
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:48,713
you about how do you evaluate
strengths and weaknesses. Right.

899
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:51,594
And I would love for you to be
able to share that too,

900
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,844
because I thought, you know, it
definitely goes along with

901
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,244
this conversation, you touched
on some of it already, but

902
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:59,213
just to be specific about that,
because I think that,

903
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:02,634
you know, that self evaluation
can be really useful in

904
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:04,403
determining where we are going.

905
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:13,838
Ray: Yeah. Um, Approach I take,
and this

906
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:16,329
again comes from Daleo is to
find, you know, believable

907
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:21,599
people, you know, who you trust
and to go ask them

908
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:22,949
about where you are strong. Um,
and then.

909
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:27,293
You know, weight, their
believability, um, based on,

910
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:30,324
well, how inclined are they to
just say nice things about you?

911
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:32,813
And a lot of this can come from
like domain expertise, right?

912
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,463
So like, you're trying to figure
out where your

913
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:37,853
technical skills are. You talk
to somebody who really

914
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:39,954
likes you, whose technical
skills you value, and they

915
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:41,483
rate you on your technical
skills or they comment on it.

916
00:47:41,514 --> 00:47:44,034
Right. I say, rate, it's not
like it's

917
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:47,083
a formal survey or anything. Um,
and they say, well, yeah,

918
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:49,364
you're really good here. You
could use some help here

919
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:51,153
too da da da, but then I also
think you're a wonderful

920
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:52,123
leader and you have all these
other skills, like.

921
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:55,693
But that's not what you're
believable on. Right.

922
00:47:56,054 --> 00:47:58,724
And what, what people often do
when they are

923
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:01,483
evaluating somebody else is they
will soften it

924
00:48:02,054 --> 00:48:04,693
way by saying nice things are
outside of their door.

925
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:08,559
And the, uh, and when I'm
looking for that kind of

926
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,539
feedback, I'm not looking for
the, to hear a bunch

927
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:14,949
of nice things, right. I'm not
looking to get bucked

928
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:17,199
up, I'm looking for, um, the,
the advice that would

929
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:17,918
allow me to make a change.
Right? So I'm not just looking

930
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,768
for

931
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:23,829
the negatives I am looking for,
like, where is it that they

932
00:48:20,768 --> 00:48:25,239
have the useful advice that is
believable in that domain?

933
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:28,389
So that technologist who then
proceeds to say my

934
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:31,494
leadership skills aren't there.
Maybe I'm paying

935
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,443
attention to that. Maybe I'm
going checking in on

936
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:37,704
my leadership skills, but I'm
not walking away with, um, a

937
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:40,074
policy prescription based on
what that person had to say,

938
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:41,543
because that's not the domain in
which they are believable.

939
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:44,634
And I know this all sounds a
little structured and what

940
00:48:44,634 --> 00:48:48,114
have you, but it really does
make a difference because

941
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:53,184
then that way, like there, um,
there's this problem. Okay.

942
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:56,063
Th th th there's a, uh, an old
Dilbert, uh, where

943
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,798
it ends with, it was such a good
idea in my head. Right.

944
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,048
And lots of ideas are good in
our own head.

945
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,219
Uh, there's a parallel thing
that my sister and

946
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:07,349
I have two sisters who are
physicians and they both

947
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:09,599
have told me separately. There's
no such

948
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:12,489
thing as a mentor. Whenever you
have something

949
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:14,018
that's just in your head, you
can persuade yourself.

950
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:16,298
That is a good thing. Or you can
persuade yourself.

951
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:19,389
That's a bad thing. Or what have
you, it's

952
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,389
this a morphous bit. But when
you actually have

953
00:49:19,778 --> 00:49:24,699
to use a technical term,
serialize your thoughts, right.

954
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:28,688
And move them across platforms,
one person to another who then

955
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:32,438
you have a high degree of trust
in that I found to be where

956
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:36,548
there's a lot of value to, um,
to, to bring out those thoughts,

957
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:38,018
to figure out what's real. And
what's not.

958
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:41,378
And to your point back, I figure
out where those strengths

959
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,188
and weaknesses really are.

960
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:47,273
Bekah: Yeah. I've also found
that there,

961
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:50,034
there are some people that are
really good at identifying

962
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:51,353
strengths and weaknesses through
conversation.

963
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:57,173
And can, can give those to you
or to talk about them.

964
00:49:57,353 --> 00:50:00,083
I hear you say this. This is
what it

965
00:49:58,403 --> 00:50:03,443
tells me about you. And, and in
those situations,

966
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:07,208
I find that there's like a. A
much faster degree of

967
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:11,168
trust I have in those people who
are able to, you know,

968
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:14,739
see and evaluate, but also be
honest about those,

969
00:50:11,168 --> 00:50:19,088
those things that they see. And
then it allows me to

970
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:22,628
kind of think about it, reflect
on it and realize,

971
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:23,829
okay, now, now what do I do with
that information now?

972
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:27,853
Ray: Yeah, no, that's, that's a
really good point.

973
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:34,028
There is such a thing as. Um,
and you can be trained to

974
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:35,469
do this better and you can use
experience to do this better.

975
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:38,559
And I'd like to think that I've
applied a little bit of training

976
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,858
and probably a bit of experience
to do it better for others.

977
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,608
Um, but the proof of that.

978
00:50:46,456 --> 00:50:49,945
Bekah: So. I was just gonna say,
like, along those lines,

979
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:53,635
are there resources that you've
also found helpful?

980
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:56,306
I mean, you've given us so many
resources here, which

981
00:50:56,335 --> 00:50:59,306
we'll all go in the show notes,
but anything that you haven't

982
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,976
mentioned or you've personally
found like, okay, well, this

983
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:07,016
really helped me on a journey.
It helped me to fill this gap

984
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:09,476
that I wasn't able to find
through self-reflection or

985
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:09,476
working with other people.

986
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:17,590
Ray: Um, yeah, I, there there's
a whole, you know, universe of,

987
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:20,050
you know, self-help literature,
but if someone's going to

988
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,621
read just one, I, I strongly
recommend Covey's Seven Habits.

989
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:30,101
Um, it is, um, it is excellent,
um, as a sort of

990
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,570
guideposts for how to make
yourself both smarter and

991
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,981
kinder all at the same time. Um,
and I'd also say

992
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:40,271
that he wrote another book right
afterwards.

993
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:43,121
He called it the eighth. And you
said the eighth habit.

994
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,371
Cause he ends the book with this
idea of sharpening, the

995
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:48,880
saw investing in yourself. And
we talk about always

996
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:49,751
be learning, but like doing it
in a compounding way.

997
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:53,170
Um, but he said there was an
eighth habit and the eighth

998
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,710
habit is elevating others voices

999
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:57,601
Bekah: Hmm.

1000
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:02,800
Ray: and helping them, uh, Find
their strengths and

1001
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,181
contribute to the world. Um, and
you know, rather

1002
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,121
than ending with the idea of
self-improvement ending with the

1003
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:14,170
idea of improvement of others.
Um, and I think those in

1004
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:16,920
combination, at least so far for
me right now, you know,

1005
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:22,181
outside of say religious texts
um, have been the, the, the

1006
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:25,181
most meaningful and immediately
helpful, um, guides, right.

1007
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:28,090
To trying to, uh, be a better
person.

1008
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:35,177
Dan: Oh, I love that idea. That,
and I feel like that's

1009
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:37,487
part of, I hope, I hope I was
part of the Virtual Coffee, you

1010
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:41,597
know, way as well, you know, as
a community, you know, doing

1011
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:43,197
that for each other, um, you
know, help fill out raising.

1012
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:46,512
Elevating their voices and
everything.

1013
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:51,163
Um, I think that, um, yeah, I
dunno.

1014
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:52,963
I was going to say, I think
that, I think that's

1015
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:56,293
a great way to wrap up. I, you
know, that, that

1016
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:59,563
idea of, of, of helping, uh,
helping each other, um,

1017
00:52:56,472 --> 00:53:02,342
together, you know, and. Did you
say that it was

1018
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:04,563
a whole second book? Like he
followed that

1019
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:05,322
up an entire book with the
eighth habit?

1020
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:08,103
Is that what you said? I'm
sorry. That's cool too.

1021
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:12,242
I'm I'm definitely. I go, I'm
going to, now that

1022
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:14,583
we've, we've mentioned about
four or five non-fiction books

1023
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:16,132
that I'm going to be putting on
my, on my, uh, to read shelf.

1024
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,917
Bekah: I just want to say,
right. Thanks so much for not

1025
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,972
