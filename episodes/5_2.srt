00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:08,589
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season five, episode two of the

2
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:13,932
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:17,711
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,292
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,172
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:26,172
stories and what they've learned.
And we are here to share it with

7
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:28,542
you here with me. Today is my
cohost.

8
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:34,642
Dan: Thanks Bekah, what's going
on. Um, today we talked with Amy

9
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:39,582
Shackles. Amy is a senior
software engineer at MURAL. MURAL

10
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:43,671
is a really cool company, a real
cool product. Um, it's a sort of

11
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:47,722
an online collaboration tool, um,
and lot of cool stuff you can do

12
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:52,101
with it. So we got to hear a lot
about MURAL and working there and

13
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,341
also the tool. Um, we, what else
did we talk about?

14
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:00,156
Bekah: Yeah. We talked about how
much Amy loves her job, but she

15
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:02,496
always like talks about it. She's
like, I'm not, I'm not just

16
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,856
saying this because it's my
product, but it's really nice to

17
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:09,936
hear her talk about enjoying what
she does, because I feel like

18
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:15,367
we're always getting. Almost like
horror stories of terrible jobs.

19
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,697
And sometimes we lose sight of
like, there are good places out

20
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:23,977
there. And so it's, it's great to
have, uh, Amy's energy and to

21
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:27,637
hear about what that, what that
path was.

22
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:30,831
Dan: Yeah. A hundred percent
agree. It was really great

23
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,522
hearing about her journey and
what do they do at their, at

24
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:37,921
MURAL that makes, um, that makes
it a good experience and. God,

25
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,492
I'm so bad at ending things.
That's my worst skill is ending

26
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:43,471
sentences, paragraphs, whatever.

27
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:47,611
Bekah: Yeah. I'm not particularly
good at it. We do. We're good

28
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,042
podcast hosts. We should like
bring in a guest ender for

29
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:54,882
things, and they're just there to
finish our sentences and our

30
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:58,302
paragraphs and the end of the
show. That's just their job.

31
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:01,322
Ender. Like a closer in baseball.

32
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:06,012
Dan: I like it. Let's do that.
Um, okay. Well, we don't have out

33
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:09,421
closer yet, so, um,

34
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,912
Bekah: If you want a job as
closer you can email

35
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,521
podcast@virtualcoffee.io.

36
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:20,282
Dan: yes, audition start
tomorrow. Um, anyway, uh, it was

37
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:22,651
a good time. It was all, I was
trying to say. We had a great

38
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,961
time talking with Amy and I know
you're going to enjoy it.

39
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:28,622
Bekah: Yeah, she does a better
job of ending things. So go Amy.

40
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:33,514
We start every episode of the
podcast. Like we start every

41
00:02:33,514 --> 00:02:36,604
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

42
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:40,593
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

43
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:52,557
you enjoy this episode. Today's
check-in question is if you were

44
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:56,967
a vending machine, what would you
dispense? And I'm cheating a

45
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,127
little bit, cause this is the one
that we use this morning, Virtual

46
00:02:59,127 --> 00:02:59,638
Coffee,

47
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,673
Amy: was going to say I'm prime
for this one,

48
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:04,768
Bekah: yeah. I already know my
answer. I don't have to think

49
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,217
about it,

50
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:06,983
Amy: except I had a bad answer

51
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,557
Dan: I'm just getting punished
for not, not

52
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:09,747
Bekah: yup. That's right.

53
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,207
Dan: the

54
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:14,737
Bekah: I'm Bekah. I am a
technical community builder from

55
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:21,217
a small town in Ohio, and I would
dispense kindness,

56
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,888
Dan: Aw, that's nice. That's
heartwarming.

57
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,138
Bekah: you making fun of me for
dispensing kindness?

58
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:36,478
Dan: Um, hi, I'm Dan. I am a web
developer from Cleveland, Ohio,

59
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:42,263
and, um, yeah, well, I mean, The
questions, you know, like what

60
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,513
would you want to dispense or
what would you actually dispense?

61
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:47,092
Because those answers are
different, I think right now. Um,

62
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,272
yeah, I would dispense be
dispensing free anxiety for

63
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:56,812
people. That's all I have a
surplus of right now. Um, you

64
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:59,573
know, I think, uh, if I, if I had
to choose anything, maybe, um,

65
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,543
maybe like camping, camping tools
or camping supplies, something

66
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:06,937
like that. I think that'd be kind
of cool, you know, Uh, titanium

67
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:11,318
silverware, or, uh, you know, I
don't know as fire starters and a

68
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,407
pocket knife or something, I
don't know, pocket knife might be

69
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:16,927
a little, little, a little dicey,
but you know, stuff you need for

70
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:20,288
camping. That's going to be my
real answer. You know that I

71
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,148
think that's it camping. That'd
be cool. That'd be cool. The new

72
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:22,418
machine.

73
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,992
Amy: That is a really good
answer. Camping supplies. I agree

74
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,262
with you with the avoidance of
including knives and that

75
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,767
Dan: Yeah. Probably not. No, sir.
Yeah.

76
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:37,043
Amy: know, want to use your
vending machine. If I were a

77
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,882
vending machine, what would I
dispense? Um, I think I would

78
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:49,283
dispense very intricate paper
hearts with uplifting messages of

79
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:49,432
hope.

80
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:56,298
Dan: Well, that's cool. Like a.
Oh wait, like origami, like to 3d

81
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,228
or 2d

82
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:01,668
Amy: That's a good question. I
was thinking like 2d, because I

83
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,788
was thinking that it would be
like calligraphy on it with the

84
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,028
messages of hope. So now that I'm
thinking about it, maybe it could

85
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:11,958
be a, like one of those, what do
you call those thirds?

86
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:12,997
Dan: Yeah. Fortune teller.

87
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:16,577
Amy: Yeah, fourtune tellers,
where you open different sections

88
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,187
and it would be a different
message of hope stylist.

89
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:20,298
Bekah: one of those on my desk.

90
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:23,377
Dan: Yes. I love that. Ah, man,

91
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,218
Bekah: All right. And your name,
where are you from? What you do?

92
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:33,877
Amy: sorry. Yes. My name is Amy
Shackles. Um, I'm a senior

93
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:39,218
software engineer at MURAL and,
uh, yeah, that's what I do.

94
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:43,237
Dan: That's awesome. Hey, I have
a question about MURAL MURAL.

95
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:48,278
Every time I see it as spelled in
all capital letters. Is it a, uh,

96
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,168
what do you call it? It's an
abbreviation. No, I mean, uh,

97
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,502
Amy: I don't believe it's an
acronym.

98
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,112
Dan: Acronym. Yeah, it's not an
acronym. Okay. That's just a

99
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,692
stylistic choice. That's cool.
Something I've wondered, you

100
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,223
know, for while. Nice.

101
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,103
Bekah: All right. Thanks so much
for being here with us today,

102
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:07,752
Amy. Um, we always like to start
off with the origin stories. So

103
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:11,353
tell us a little bit about how
you got to this point in your

104
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:11,622
life.

105
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,283
Amy: Good question. Well, once
upon a time I was born, uh, and

106
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:24,127
probably don't need to go back
that far. So I growing up always

107
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:28,088
thought that I wanted to be a
psychologist. So, uh, I did my

108
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:32,333
undergrad in psychology and the
Anthropocene. Uh, because I loved

109
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:36,502
people and the study of people,
thus the anthropology, which was

110
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:41,093
funny because my anthropology,
um, professor understood the

111
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:45,233
double major was psychology. The
psychology professor did not

112
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,533
understand how those would
relate. And, uh, it was just

113
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:53,483
funny that there was a
disconnect, um, But I, I re I

114
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:57,353
realized I'm the kind of person
who, uh, people have the tendency

115
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:01,432
to like, open up to me and share
their secrets and their, uh, like

116
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:07,072
struggles. And I tend to want to
respond by sharing things about

117
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,502
myself. And you can't do that as
a psychologist. You're like

118
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:14,302
banned, like no personal sharing
and so on like that, I would be a

119
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:17,302
really bad psychologist. I can't
turn that part of myself off.

120
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:21,112
It's not going to happen. So I
didn't pursue psychology, even

121
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:26,452
though I have a degree in it. And
so I got out of college and I was

122
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:30,442
a transcriptionist for like a
decade, just listening to audio,

123
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:35,932
uh, typing what you hear, which
is great, except, um, the robots

124
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,853
are getting better at it. And so.

125
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:41,307
Bekah: The company, I work for
speech

126
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:47,492
Amy: we're being replaced. So I,
uh, decided to switch careers and

127
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:50,793
my husband was a software
developer software engineer. And

128
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:54,843
so I had an idea of what that
life was like, and I wanted it

129
00:07:54,843 --> 00:08:01,682
for myself. So I did a bootcamp
and, uh, then just started

130
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,403
working in tech.

131
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:07,163
Dan: That's awesome. So how long
ago was, what did you do the

132
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:07,612
bootcamp.

133
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:12,802
Amy: Uh, I started in April,
2018. I ended in October, 2018.

134
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:18,622
Dan: Nice. That's really cool. So
when you were doing transcription

135
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:22,673
or was it a normal keyboard or
what you're doing? Like isn't one

136
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:25,372
of those, I don't know. Isn't one
of those.

137
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,343
Amy: stenography.

138
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,603
Dan: Yeah, that's it? Yeah. Like,

139
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,738
Amy: a stenography machine. Uh, I
used a regular keyboard,

140
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,268
Dan: Yeah. Impressive

141
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,847
Amy: faster typing speeds than I
currently do.

142
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:41,567
Dan: man. Yeah. That's that skill
is an impressive skill to me. I

143
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:45,097
always, my, uh, I don't know if I
could do it for you in more than

144
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:45,937
like five minutes.

145
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:52,018
Bekah: hard. I, I did it once for
an event. All I had to do was one

146
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:57,357
talk and it took me so long to do
that. Talk like this was not

147
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:57,868
worth it.

148
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:02,232
Amy: Yeah, the trick is knowing
that foot pedals exist and you

149
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,712
can use them. Uh it's what most
of us use when

150
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:07,008
Dan: Wait, how do you use foot

151
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:11,437
Amy: Yeah. you just plug it into
your computer. There's a play a

152
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:15,607
play pad, uh, fast forward
rewind. You can usually, uh,

153
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,817
configure it to do it the other
direction. Some people decided to

154
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:23,618
have rewind on the right instead
of the left. It kind of varies.

155
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:28,988
You can have your playback, uh,
replay the last 10 seconds or

156
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:32,738
five seconds or whatever. So it
just depends on your own

157
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,038
personal.

158
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,937
Dan: Oh, okay. So you didn't have
a special keyboard, but you had

159
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:39,758
the secret, you had specked
secret tools. That's right. Okay.

160
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,187
The truth comes out. That's
awesome. That's really cool.

161
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:45,337
That's I mean, obviously also a
good idea. I have just seen, um,

162
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,347
they've probably been around for
a while, but I just saw them

163
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:50,427
coming out for, um, like gaming
and stuff, you know, or streaming

164
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,988
or I dunno something, but oh, it
seemed like good. Yeah. You know,

165
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:59,873
on unused. Appendages for, you
know, when you're working

166
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,248
Amy: It's an extension of
yourself. Yes.

167
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,462
Dan: I mean, your feet are just
sitting there most of the time

168
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,653
doing nothing to get them to
work.

169
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,452
Amy: One of the downsides of
being transcriptionist, though,

170
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,852
with a foot pedal is that you
can't really do a standing desk

171
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,763
because you need that foot on the
floor and it would be really

172
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:18,153
awkward to have to balance.

173
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:23,827
Bekah: that'd be tough. Okay. All
right. So you went from

174
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:28,087
transcription, then you went to
bootcamp and you graduated in

175
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:35,457
2020, right? Oh, And then did you
start working at Muir? No you

176
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:36,508
weren't at MURAL first.

177
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,467
Amy: No I was at Skip List first.

178
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,738
Bekah: Okay. So what was that
transition like from boot camp

179
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:44,398
into your first.

180
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:48,618
Amy: That's a good question. Um,
uh, the transition for me was

181
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:54,817
kind of interesting insofar as
like, When I started my job at

182
00:10:55,177 --> 00:11:00,008
skip list, I was already the
React expert and I was working on

183
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:05,227
an application. It was React and
Redux. And so from like the jump,

184
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:08,077
I was already the person with the
most experience with React and

185
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:12,187
Redux. And I had to like refactor
the entire application because it

186
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:18,967
was written kind of generally,
uh, there, it was a lot of

187
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,427
responsibility from the get-go,
uh, which was.

188
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:22,628
Bekah: Sound super stressful.

189
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:23,663
Amy: A little bit.

190
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,888
Bekah: All right. And then I, one
of the things that I always love

191
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:33,447
hearing you talk about is MURAL.
And just for reference, this is

192
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:38,727
not a sponsored episode of the
podcast, but Amy, you always talk

193
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:42,447
about how much you love it. And I
like hearing you talk about it

194
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:46,748
because. I often hear people talk
about how terrible their jobs

195
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,557
are. So anytime someone has a
good experience, I always want to

196
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:54,908
know more about that. So what
kind of drew you to MURAL and

197
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:57,727
what do you think makes it a good
place?

198
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:03,447
Amy: Um, what drew me to MURAL?
Uh, I'll be honest was that I had

199
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,447
a friend that works there and
gave me an internal referral. So

200
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,168
I, I'm not one of those people
that knew the product and love

201
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:14,427
the product and then joined the
company. Uh, But I fell in love

202
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:17,908
with it afterward. Uh, I use it
all the time. I recommended to

203
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:20,967
friends. I think I recommended it
to you at one point, because you

204
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,048
were looking for a tool.

205
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,437
Bekah: Yeah, we got a team
account on there.

206
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:30,023
Amy: Yes. Um, but, uh, things
that I love working there for

207
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:33,893
reasons I love working there, uh,
include like the fact that it's

208
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:38,182
actually really global. Um, like
some companies say that they're

209
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:41,783
global, but it's like, you have a
team in India, you have a team in

210
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,812
the United States and those teams
don't really interact with each

211
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:49,013
other. Like if you do, it's
occasional, it's not an everyday

212
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:54,503
thing. Um, but my team
specifically, like. I think now

213
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:57,082
we're finally at a point that
there are more Americans than

214
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:00,592
there are Argentinians, but when
I first started, it was just

215
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,932
Argentinians and I, and so
there's that four hour gap for a

216
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,413
part of the year in five-hour gap
for another part of the year. Um,

217
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:13,852
so because we have so many people
from different regions, there's a

218
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:21,682
lot of like having to understand
that, uh, communication, uh, is.

219
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:25,327
Easily misunderstood. And you
have to be patient it's like the

220
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:28,658
same thing that we've we talk
about in Virtual Coffee, like

221
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:34,687
being receptive to how other
people interact and like taking

222
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:39,817
it on good faith that like
they're not intentionally being

223
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:44,677
abrupt or rude or whatever. Like
there's lots of things that can

224
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:49,148
be lost in translation. And, uh,
one of the things I really love

225
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:52,957
is that they're like very
encouraging of me to. Like try to

226
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,368
learn Spanish. I'm like working
on it. I'm still pretty terrible.

227
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:02,677
But learning Argentinian Spanish
is like, ah, I love it so much.

228
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:06,368
It's like so different than the
Spanish I grew up with in like

229
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:13,232
high school learning Spanish. Um,
but I, I just love how. Like

230
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,773
every everybody's like open and
receptive, so like helping other

231
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,852
people and like, even if it's not
your team, everyone bands

232
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:28,373
together over a problem, like
it's just really communal in the,

233
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,993
in the way that we operate, I
guess. Uh, that's one of the

234
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:32,623
reasons I love it.

235
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,842
Dan: I, uh, I was just gonna say,
I'm glad to hear that like that.

236
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,623
And it is also not surprising, I
guess, that, um, a company like

237
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:44,923
MURAL where their product is
about collaboration and, you

238
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:47,773
know, team building and stuff
like that, that they also have,

239
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,373
like, they reflect that in
internally. Um, it's cool. Yeah.

240
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:55,273
It doesn't always, it's not
always true, you know? Um, but it

241
00:14:55,273 --> 00:15:00,253
says a lot about the product too,
I think. Right. Cause, um, I

242
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:01,962
imagine you guys, do you use.

243
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:03,253
Amy: Oh, yeah.

244
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,947
Dan: in the company. Yeah, that's
what I was gonna say.

245
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:05,293
Amy: the

246
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,697
Dan: Yeah. I didn't want to make
assumptions, but the fact that

247
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,927
the fact that like you're using
your own tool at, you know, as,

248
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:16,317
uh, probably pretty heavily and,
you know, you'd probably depend

249
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:19,618
on it. Um, the tool that you're
making in selling other people

250
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,798
it's, uh, says a lot, you know, a
lot of good things about the tool

251
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:26,158
itself. So that's pretty cool to
have to have that, you know, and

252
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:31,572
I'm working right now on, uh, an
app. The company that makes, uh,

253
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,363
like pressure gauges and stuff,
you know, and it's like, great

254
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:36,493
work. And like, this is not
anything against my team, you

255
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:39,253
know, but I'm not like going out
there getting excited about

256
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:43,753
pressure gauges in my life. You
know, we don't have like meetings

257
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:48,192
where we're looking at it, you
know, we're, uh, We talk

258
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,743
sometimes about trying to like
blow into it, to see how, you

259
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,913
know, if we can, if we can get
the pressure gauge to, I don't

260
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:57,253
know, do something, but it's not
the same, you know, it's not the

261
00:15:57,253 --> 00:16:00,812
same. So it's cool that you guys
have this tool that what'd, they

262
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:04,842
call it. Oh, I'm dark footing,
right? That's dogfooding we got

263
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:07,633
it. We have jokes about that. I
don't, I know it's not good. One.

264
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,932
It's not a good one, but I think
that it's at least the right

265
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:13,302
thing where you're using the
thing that you're selling to

266
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,707
other people or whatever. And
probably helps it make, make it

267
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:17,878
better. Do you guys,

268
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:21,602
Amy: we definitely feel the pain
points that our customers feel

269
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,562
because we run up against the
same blocks and more often than

270
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:30,243
not like w we develop features
because we want them and at other

271
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:34,982
people also want them. And like,
we discover bugs before our

272
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,712
customers do most of the time,
because we are also using the

273
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:38,643
product. So.

274
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:42,018
Dan: Yes. That exactly that's
well put, and that is exactly

275
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,778
what I was sort of getting
towards was was that, you know

276
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,918
what I mean? It's like a, you're
naturally improving the product,

277
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:51,618
uh, even when you're not like,
you know, writing code or not,

278
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:54,048
not working on it, you know what
I mean? Because you use it so

279
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:57,918
much. It's really neat. That's
it? It's a unique, uh, customer

280
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:58,368
zero.

281
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,952
Amy: Customer zero makes it sound
like it's the beginning of an

282
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:02,942
infectious disease.

283
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:09,327
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking
more like some sort of spy movie

284
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:19,228
or something, but, man. Yeah.
Well, thank you for that.

285
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:26,192
Amy: How this podcast ends up
being 20 minutes.

286
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:32,772
Bekah: Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going
to back up and get on track here

287
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:35,833
a little bit. Uh, all right. So
you went from bootcamp and then

288
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:41,472
you had a couple of days. And you
are a senior software engineer

289
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:45,702
and that's, I feel like you've
accomplished a lot in a very

290
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:49,153
short amount of time, so good job
and congratulations. But also

291
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:53,053
what does that, what does that
career progression like for you?

292
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:56,353
I know that, you know, a lot of
people, especially who are coming

293
00:17:56,353 --> 00:18:02,113
out of bootcamp are self-taught
like, am I in entry-level? Am I

294
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:06,823
mid-level? Like, how, how did
that feel as you made that career

295
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:07,093
progress?

296
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:12,178
Amy: So if my, if I'm honest,
like that's the one thing that's

297
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,627
been like, the struggle for me
ever since I got out of bootcamp

298
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,718
is like, I, I applied for
entry-level positions and I

299
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,528
applied for mid-level positions.
And then sometimes when I'm

300
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:27,357
feeling confident, I fly for
senior positions and, uh, it just

301
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,938
worked out that this time they
thought I was a senior engineer

302
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:34,438
because of my previous
experience. uh, I've definitely

303
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:38,518
had interviews with, uh,
companies that like mid-level,

304
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:42,298
uh, I think even some junior
positions where they're like,

305
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,688
yeah, you don't really have the
level of experience that were

306
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:49,258
looking for. It's just, that's
the one thing that's really

307
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:53,488
frustrating about the software
engineering, uh, space is just,

308
00:18:53,488 --> 00:19:00,268
there's so many differences in
opinion about what it means to be

309
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:06,807
an engineer like. A lot of it is
mindset. I feel like the ability

310
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:11,157
to learn new things and pick
things up quickly and then work

311
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:16,557
iteratively on solutions is like
the most important thing. But

312
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:20,877
it's hard to pinpoint where
people are in that journey. So

313
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:24,732
like it's a struggle that
everybody has. And. So I can't

314
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:29,742
really give advice on how to
gauge where you are. Cause I, I,

315
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:33,373
I struggled with it also. I I'm
glad that a company made the

316
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,373
decision for me and that going
forward. I can just say I'm a

317
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:42,042
senior engineer because I am. Uh,
but before that I was kind of

318
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:42,972
lost with the wind.

319
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:48,298
Dan: Yeah, I like the way you
said that about, um, excuse me

320
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,907
about, um, being able to like
learn things and then iterate on,

321
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,317
on like improving them and stuff
like that. I feel like that I

322
00:19:55,317 --> 00:20:00,432
feel like, um, for me, one of
the. Well, there's a lot of

323
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,403
different things going on in
this, in like this process of,

324
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:07,153
you know, uh, job finding and,
and, and like level-setting

325
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:11,083
yourself and things like that.
Right. But, um, for me, with

326
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,262
development, especially when you
get to senior levels or whatever,

327
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:19,182
it's, it's a lot less, um, or it
should be anyway, a lot less, uh,

328
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:24,373
about like a specific checkbox on
a list of skills or whatever, and

329
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,923
more about mindset. That's just
the way exactly the way you put

330
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:30,823
it, you know? The ability and the
confidence that you can, you

331
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:36,252
know, pick things up and, um, and
you know, you know, that you'll

332
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:38,502
be able to learn things and you
know, that you have to learn

333
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,782
things like everybody learns
every, like that's part of the

334
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,083
developer being a developer, you
know, uh, experience right. Is,

335
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,163
is, um, having to learn things
all the time. I have, like, I've

336
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,323
been doing this for a real long
time and still I'm learning new

337
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:53,232
things every day, you know? And
it's one of the things I like

338
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:58,468
about it, but, uh it's um, and I
feel like that. People get caught

339
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,748
up. I think when they're younger,
well, not younger, but, um,

340
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,587
earlier in the career in trying
to match those checkboxes or

341
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:07,528
whatever, and you know, this job
listings always have these

342
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:11,728
ridiculous requirements that were
written by a marketing person

343
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:17,397
probably. And, um, but that, like
that process of learning things

344
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:22,778
iterating on them, you know, uh,
and, and. And then, and then

345
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:25,397
learning, moving on and learning
new things, you know, is, is the,

346
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,438
that's the real thing. Right. And
that's the, I feel like that's

347
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:31,218
the thing that's sets aside or
sets apart people that maybe I

348
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:34,067
would call it senior, you know,
senior level, at least then than

349
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:39,198
not is less like all of the
things I know and more like sort

350
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,678
of internal competence that I can
take up thing and then learn it

351
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:47,928
and then do it, you know, I think
that's, uh, I guess, cool. Um,

352
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:51,393
Amy: think it's less about like,
pretending that, you know, things

353
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:56,643
or like waffling on like what,
you know, uh, like trying

354
00:21:56,762 --> 00:22:01,292
desperately to pull things in and
more like admitting you don't

355
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:06,222
know it, but you can't. I, I will
learn it in the future, but I'm

356
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:08,742
not going to say that I know it
now because that's a lie.

357
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:14,057
Dan: yeah, yeah, totally. Like if
I was doing a, if I was

358
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,208
conducting an interview and I
asked somebody, oh, can you do X

359
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:21,917
or whatever? And they said, uh,
maybe, or so, you know, like

360
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:25,363
waffling, just like you said
that. Not as like, but, but if

361
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:27,103
somebody said, no, I didn't know
that. I don't know that, but I

362
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:30,012
know that I could pick it up. You
know what I mean? Like, without

363
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:33,192
like, without any waffling, uh,
that's like, that's a big sign

364
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:37,242
for me, you know, that that's um,
that's cool. That's good to hear.

365
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:41,833
Do you, um, in your position at
Sr or do you do much management

366
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,542
at all or are you doing mostly
just coding?

367
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:48,387
Amy: I am just doing coding. I am
not in the management track at

368
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:52,768
all. Uh, we have two different
tracks and I chose the one that

369
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:57,958
involves engineering, uh, because
I I've, I've had so many friends

370
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,782
that, um, They, they level up in
engineering and then become

371
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:06,252
managers and they hate it because
it's just managing people and

372
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:08,893
they never get to touch code. And
they're like, why am I even an

373
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:13,153
engineer now? This isn't fun
anymore. And I'm like, uh, that's

374
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:16,722
not for me. At least not now,
maybe in the future, but it's not

375
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:18,553
where I see myself currently.

376
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,633
Dan: absolutely completely
different skill set too. Right.

377
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,692
So you're all of a sudden
starting from zero in a new job.

378
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,212
I think some people like
companies don't understand that

379
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:31,202
lots of times and people that are
accepting positions don't maybe

380
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,942
don't always grab that either,
but that's really cool. That

381
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:37,363
MURAL has that track. Um, even at
being at a senior level. That you

382
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:40,212
can't concentrate on just being
an engineer, not just, but like

383
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:44,833
only an engineer. Um, that is
another really nice thing. Sounds

384
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,913
like a pretty great place to
work.

385
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:47,323
Amy: love it.

386
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:52,603
Dan: Oh man. And again, we're not
being sponsored. We're not being

387
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,502
sponsored by MURALs.

388
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,542
Amy: But we are hiring.

389
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,557
Bekah: Um, okay. So, so MURAL we
have established is a very good

390
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:08,667
place to work and they are
hiring. so you can apply if you

391
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,907
want to. Um, but not everybody is
going to get a job at MURAL,

392
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:16,617
right? So for people who can not
get a job at MURAL, what do you

393
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:22,708
think are some things to look for
in a company, um, to help them to

394
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:26,637
determine. Okay. Is this a good
company? Is this a positive space

395
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,647
or, you know, like maybe some of
the things that you just love

396
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:33,028
about MURAL that they can kind of
think about, uh, when applying to

397
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:33,718
other places.

398
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:40,722
Amy: Yeah. So, uh, one of the
things that I usually try to. Uh,

399
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:44,982
ask companies when I'm in the
interview process is like, what's

400
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:49,002
your, what's your procedure for,
uh, actually shipping code? Like

401
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:52,603
what's the process? Do you, do
you have code reviews? If you

402
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:56,053
have code reviews, how many
people signed off? What's the

403
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:59,682
process? If there's conflicts,
how do you actually interact with

404
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:05,998
your team? Like, what kind of
structure is in place? Like, is

405
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:10,498
there a hierarchy? Is there not a
hierarchy? It really depends, uh,

406
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:15,238
on company, whether they decide
to have, uh, multiple people at

407
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:19,978
different levels within a team,
or if they'll consider them

408
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:26,502
homogenous, um, Uh, like asking,
like what, what kind of things

409
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:29,383
happen? Like how do they handle
conflict is something that I

410
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:33,133
really like asking companies,
just like, they usually like

411
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:40,153
asking you, like, it's important
for both sides. Like, uh, I also

412
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:45,192
tend to ask like for like, uh,
time off, like how they

413
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:51,712
prioritize. Because some
companies do unlimited PTO and

414
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:57,593
for some companies unlimited PTO
is a lie that they use to say

415
00:25:57,593 --> 00:26:01,192
that, you know, you can have as
much time off as you want, but

416
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,373
really it's really hard to
approve that. And there's so many

417
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:09,448
caveats, so it's not actually a
PTO and no one takes it. Um,

418
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:14,488
other companies really prioritize
PTO and, uh, even take it so far

419
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:19,198
as some people are not taking PTO
and we've noticed this. So now

420
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,978
going forward every quarter,
there is a day that everyone has

421
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:27,778
off because we want people to
take breaks. Um, and so like

422
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:32,008
figuring out how they feel about
time off is also important. Uh,

423
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:38,383
asking about work-life balance is
a good one. Um, But sometimes

424
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:41,532
it's important to like find
people that work at the company

425
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:45,883
and ask them rather than like
asking the recruiter. Who's going

426
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:50,712
to tell you the like, company
line, uh, it's always better to

427
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:54,762
ask real people who are going
through it, what their

428
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:55,093
experience.

429
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:00,048
Bekah: Yeah, you learn so much
that way. And I think asking for

430
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,657
examples, kind of like you were
saying, you know, the company

431
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,417
asks you for these things. It's
okay to ask them the same thing

432
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:10,278
back, but like give me an example
of how your company prioritizes

433
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:17,383
work-life balance or, uh, how
their paid time off is. Uh,

434
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:21,042
something that they prioritize
for their employees or whatever.

435
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:25,032
Um, cause it does give you a good
sense of the company, but also

436
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:29,383
the team that you're working on.
You know, if you, if there's an

437
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:33,103
emergency and you're worried that
you might miss a meeting or

438
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:36,762
something like that, that
shouldn't be the priority, right.

439
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:39,643
It shouldn't be like, oh, I'm
missing a meeting. She'd be like,

440
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:43,663
I need to deal with this
emergency. I think that's a

441
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:50,192
pretty good indicator that. Maybe
there's problems with the company

442
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:53,792
or the team. So asking people
about experiences and getting

443
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,942
examples from people is super
helpful.

444
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:02,373
Amy: Yeah, one question that I, I
usually ask that I, um, forgot,

445
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:06,032
uh, up until this point. Cause
I'm good at things. Um, is, uh,

446
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:11,827
how do you measure success?
'cause, uh, that'll usually like

447
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:18,278
give you a good idea about where
their priorities lie. Um, though,

448
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:22,958
I'll give you a caveat that, that
some interviewers, uh, will not

449
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:27,788
be prepared for that question and
will waffle a bit just because

450
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,468
it's not a question that everyone
asks.

451
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,502
Bekah: How do you measure
success, Amy?

452
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:41,008
Amy: So good question. I'm not
prepared. I I'm proving my own

453
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:45,867
point. I measure success when
people feel comfortable being

454
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:50,367
vulnerable and opening themselves
up to admitting mistakes,

455
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:55,917
admitting, uh, a lack of
understanding, uh, admitting that

456
00:28:55,917 --> 00:29:01,557
they need help. Like you need to
have a lot of workplace safety.

457
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:05,532
To get at that point that like
people, individual people feel

458
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:09,373
like they can be vulnerable that
way. And it's only through people

459
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,222
feeling like they can be
vulnerable, that you can help

460
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,853
people succeed. So that's how I
measure success.

461
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:21,698
Dan: That's a really good answer
to saying, well, yeah, there's, I

462
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:25,028
mean, there's lots of, uh, bad
ways that people, that companies,

463
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:29,377
you know, measure success or at
least today that would call bad,

464
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:32,887
you know, and that those are
usually like more like check

465
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,647
boxes or whatever, you know, uh,
or how

466
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:36,303
Amy: Okay.

467
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:42,458
Dan: that they get done. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, and your answer is not

468
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,057
that, and that's.

469
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:49,192
Bekah: Yeah. it seems like. A lot
of the positive things that we've

470
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:53,153
been talking about has to do
with, um, vulnerability and open

471
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:57,292
communication. And those things
are hugely important. And even

472
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:01,163
going back to what differentiates
a senior developer to like

473
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:04,883
having, I mean, there were plenty
of very terrible communicators

474
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:08,573
who are senior developers, but I
think that a good senior

475
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:13,347
developer. Is has good
communication skills. They're

476
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:18,178
willing to listen to other
people, um, and do exactly what

477
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,028
you said, like express when, when
they need help with something or

478
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,538
they don't have a clear
understanding of what's going on

479
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,647
because that also sets the
example for everybody else on the

480
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:32,907
team that it's okay to have
questions. It is okay to make a

481
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:37,167
mistake. And it's how, how do you
improve on that?

482
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:42,557
Amy: Yeah. Uh, I like to say that
there are no stupid questions.

483
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:47,538
There's just stupid reactions to
quick. Like the answer is being

484
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:52,488
stupid. Uh, it's not the question
itself. Um, I used to be part of

485
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:56,538
a different developer, um,
community and I built a slack bot

486
00:30:56,597 --> 00:31:00,557
that would automatically respond
to the, the phrase stupid

487
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:04,657
question where there are no
stupid questions just cause I, I

488
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,998
wanted to train the juniors out
of saying it.

489
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:13,951
Dan: Yeah, that's big it. Maybe
she'd get that. Get that on our

490
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:14,490
site going,

491
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:19,147
Bekah: I just had like nine ideas
all at once now.

492
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:22,742
Amy: Infinite possibility.

493
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:26,157
Dan: it ha it happens every ever
podcast. One of the guest says

494
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:31,018
something in both Bekah and I are
just like, just thinking, just

495
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:34,107
like, oh man,

496
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:39,508
Bekah: Yeah. I, um, okay, so, so
maybe there's not a connection

497
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:44,143
here, but your background is in
psychology and. Now you're a

498
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:49,843
developer. So have you utilized
any of the things that you've

499
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:55,363
learned with your degree? Or can
you talk about any transferable

500
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:56,772
skills from that?

501
00:31:57,478 --> 00:32:00,792
Amy: Definitely. I mean,
Interacting with humans in

502
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:08,923
general that like having some
knowledge of how a consciousness

503
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:14,292
operates, like how people think
and how different people think

504
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:18,792
like cultural differences. Uh,
it, it definitely is helpful when

505
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:24,252
you're dealing with communication
between people, um, facilitating

506
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:28,603
communication and making sure
that different people. Same page.

507
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:33,492
Um, it it's something that I've
always had. Like, I always

508
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:38,083
consider it like a gift and a
curse that I can hear. Two people

509
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,563
talk about something and see
their point of view. Even if

510
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:46,512
there are contrasting points of
view and then you get them to

511
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:50,637
realize. They're saying different
things and coming from different

512
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:55,258
places, but really their goal is
the same and you can get them on

513
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:58,557
the goal if they just realize
what the other person's saying.

514
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:01,488
So you just have to like
translate to the other person's

515
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:07,137
speaking style, like how they're
actually thinking. Um, it,

516
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:13,198
thankfully that, that, that part
of it is less, um, I've utilized

517
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:18,268
that less at work, but I do find
it helpful in. In life,

518
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,317
especially Twitter.

519
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:25,308
Dan: Me. Yeah, probably I'll use
a little bit of extra extra of

520
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:31,578
that on Twitter. That's pretty
cool. It sounds like the kind of

521
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:35,054
stuff, a really good manager who
says to us. So I was kind of

522
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,294
surprised that you hadn't
mentioned stuff, but I bet you'd

523
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:41,354
be good at it if you want it to,
but then you'd be managing and

524
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,134
not coding. So.

525
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:47,733
Amy: for the future.

526
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,239
Bekah: What I would have been
like some of the biggest

527
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,878
surprises along your journey.

528
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:58,222
Amy: Uh, good question. Um, well,
I guess one of the surprises for

529
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:02,393
me is like personally, when I,
when I started getting into

530
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:06,653
coding, I did coding all the
time. Like all the time I had no

531
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:09,893
other hobby, it was just
developing things, creating

532
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:14,742
things and pushing code, like.
Whereas we're always green and

533
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:18,072
people would always say, Amy,
you're going to burn out. This is

534
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:23,233
how people get burned out. Don't
do it. It's bad. And I was always

535
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,773
like, no, I'll never stop loving
coding. I love this. That's what

536
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:32,952
I'll do for forever. Um, but now
I'm to the point where I code at

537
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:38,592
work and I don't usually go to
outside of work. Um, like I got

538
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:43,393
really big into crochet and, and
so now I crochet and I will talk

539
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:47,182
people's ears off about regex.
Cause I love regex with a fierce

540
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:48,552
ungodly passion

541
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,893
Bekah: You're the only person in
the world I've ever heard say

542
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:51,043
that

543
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:54,702
Amy: Which is Also

544
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:55,753
Bekah: you like a

545
00:34:55,768 --> 00:35:00,297
Amy: Also surprising to me
because when I first, when I

546
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,927
first came into contact with
regex, I hated it. Like fiercely

547
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:08,697
hated it. I avoided it at all
costs. Um, but then I decided

548
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:12,438
that it w it was just going to be
one of those things that I, I

549
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:15,958
fear. So I'm going to get in
contact with it. So I stopped

550
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:21,297
fearing it. Yeah. Conquer it. And
so I got way down into the deep

551
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:25,978
rabbit hole that is regex, trying
to build a regex parser. And I'm

552
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:29,907
still on that journey. It's still
one of my side projects that

553
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:35,577
always haunts me. It's just
taunting me on a regular basis,

554
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:39,387
but I have so much regex
knowledge, just like in my head

555
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:44,248
at all times. It's like the only
reason I have any Stack Overflow

556
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:46,237
credit is, is regex.

557
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:51,052
Dan: that's cool. Yes, no, I
generally try to avoid it, but I

558
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,393
mean, I know that there's some,
you know, there's problems where

559
00:35:53,393 --> 00:35:55,583
you, you recognize pretty
quickly, like regex would be a

560
00:35:55,583 --> 00:36:00,757
good tool for this, you know? And
then I go Google for hopefully a

561
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:05,228
regex solution. And if I can't
find it quickly, I'm like, all

562
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:08,318
right, forget this. We're going,
we're doing for loops. We're

563
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:14,777
going through it. That's awesome.
So, wait, you're writing a regex

564
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:20,347
parser, um, to parse regex like
threads experience.

565
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,293
Amy: the idea.

566
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,818
Bekah: we just pause for a
second? Because I know that not

567
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:26,097
everybody listening to the
podcast is going to be familiar

568
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:29,547
with. Yeah. Yeah. Can you just
give a explanation?

569
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:36,503
Amy: Yeah, let's see if I can
find a good online. Um, because I

570
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:41,273
don't know how I would describe
it to other people. you have a

571
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:42,262
good definition

572
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:46,807
Dan: no, it's a, so it's an
expression. That's very regular,

573
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:48,967
regular expressions.

574
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:53,182
Amy: not. Okay. A regular
expression is a sequence of

575
00:36:53,182 --> 00:37:00,652
characters that specifies a
search pattern in text. Um, and

576
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,862
Dan: That's exactly what I said.
All right. By the way.

577
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:13,313
Amy: I love you guys. um, the,
the goal of my project, uh, which

578
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:20,467
is to, uh, build a. Tool that
eventually would be extended to a

579
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:25,688
vs code extension. Uh, the goal
is that it would scan a file,

580
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:31,358
find anything that had a regular
expression in it. And then if you

581
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,867
hovered over the regular
expression, it would break down

582
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:37,597
what that expression is doing.
Okay.

583
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,483
Dan: That would be dope.

584
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:42,833
Amy: Human language. Uh, just
because there are so many bugs

585
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:46,702
that can be caught that way,
because like, you don't realize

586
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:52,523
that you're over matching. Um,
and yeah, so it's a ongoing

587
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,543
project that I started a while
ago and I I've rewritten it like

588
00:37:56,543 --> 00:38:00,983
three times and I keep finding
new ways for it to be broken and

589
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:03,922
new edge cases. But one day I
will succeed.

590
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:08,168
Dan: That's awesome. Yeah, that's
really cool. Yeah. So, I mean, I

591
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:11,677
was kind of joking, but yeah, you
use, if you are still unfamiliar

592
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:14,978
with what a regular expressions
are, you know, like, do you use

593
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:19,523
them for things like. For, you
know, matching strings inside of

594
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:22,282
a bigger string. Right. Uh, so if
you want to find all of the

595
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,893
instances of Bekah in the
podcast, transcripts or

596
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:29,003
something, that's a really simple
one, right. Um, except that if

597
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:33,413
you want to throw in, okay, so
you want, um, you know, capital

598
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:36,547
and lowercase in case the
transcribing thing. It was

599
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,027
messing up. Right. You know,
there's like, uh there's um,

600
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,208
little, and it looks like
nonsense when you are first

601
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,117
learning it, but a little piece
of code that you stick in to the

602
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:49,208
matching string. So you can say,
okay, just do lowercase, right.

603
00:38:49,237 --> 00:38:53,318
Or do all cases, ignore cases,
um, uh, things like that. Right.

604
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:57,248
And, and then you can start doing
chunks of like, patterns, right.

605
00:38:57,248 --> 00:39:01,342
So you could do. Any sentence
that starts with Bekah is or

606
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:04,572
something, right. Like that kind
of thing. Um, there's lots of

607
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,762
like, there's a million
different, I'm sure you can think

608
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,552
of more interesting examples.
Cause I, I use them very

609
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:14,003
infrequently, but it's, it's the,
that's what the tool like, that's

610
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:16,643
what the regular expression tool
in general is used for. And

611
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:19,583
pretty much all I don't know
about pretty much all, but like

612
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:24,773
most of the coding languages you
use have, you know, have that

613
00:39:24,773 --> 00:39:29,963
ability right in them. Um, And
it's, I dunno, it's one of those.

614
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:31,762
Yeah. It's one of the things
that's like, it looks like

615
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,503
nonsense when you look at it. And
so if you're learning, you

616
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:36,773
probably would just ignore it,
you know, as fast as you can run

617
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,182
away from it. I

618
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:44,007
Amy: I use and probably abuse it
too. Uh, do find replace a lot

619
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:49,407
like text replacement. And
whenever I'm like, I have a comma

620
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:53,967
dilemma delineated line, and I
want to turn into an object. Uh,

621
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,697
I'm going to use regex to find
her place.

622
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,052
Dan: Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah.
And so if you use vs code, uh,

623
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:02,242
you, you have the option of
turning that on in your, in your

624
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:06,532
final replace, in VS code, it is
regex. It's like S like hiding

625
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:12,952
around everywhere. Like a lot of
at least in developed in

626
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,753
developer tools, you know,
you'll, you'll see it, you know,

627
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:17,222
turn it on and then you'll turn
it off because it doesn't do what

628
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:20,152
to expect if you don't. Um, if
you don't, aren't already

629
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:20,782
familiar with it.

630
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:23,108
Amy: Yeah. You have to know what
to escape. If you have

631
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:27,983
Dan: right, exactly. Yeah. I, uh,
yeah, no, that that'd be a cool

632
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:31,222
tool that would be able to, um,
be able to see that like sort of

633
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:34,862
interactive, um, stuff with this
stuff you're typing. That'd be

634
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,922
neat. So get to work on that.

635
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:37,898
Amy: I'm working.

636
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:39,393
Bekah: Is it, is it, open?

637
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:40,943
Dan: So I was going to say, is it
open source?

638
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:51,952
Amy: All of the versions are
public GitHub, but, um, uh, They

639
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:55,402
might be broken at different
parts. I don't know what state

640
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:59,213
they're in. A lot of the things
that I build are open source. So.

641
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:06,023
I think I have a react selector
that's like accessible. And so

642
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:10,222
that's opensource. That's like
the one, uh, repo that I

643
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:13,702
currently have that actually has
a contribution from somebody

644
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:17,902
other than myself. It was very
surprising. One day when I got an

645
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:21,233
email while it was a work that
there was an issue and I was

646
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:24,293
like, oh no, I'm going to have to
solve this issue. And I got

647
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:27,802
another email also while I was at
work saying I had a pull request.

648
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:32,103
To fix that issue and it was
magic.

649
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,693
Dan: That's that's awesome.

650
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,788
Bekah: we'll have to drop links
to all those in the show notes.

651
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:43,702
Dan: parse, underscore rejects.
That's one more.

652
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:44,793
Amy: I wasn't one of them,

653
00:41:44,842 --> 00:41:45,682
Dan: Is that the one we're
talking about?

654
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:52,483
Amy: I think there's a regular
expression parser, so many

655
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:53,193
variations.

656
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:58,568
Dan: There's a there's regex
parser, but it's empty. So this

657
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:02,168
might be not the right word.
looking around your

658
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,413
Bekah: I created a pull request
today and it was like one file

659
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:11,532
changed, empty, like, oh, that's
great. Glad that I was very

660
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:21,382
effective, but that. So not sure
how that happened. Um, uh, well,

661
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:26,963
so I think the goal may be then
for 2022, should be to complete

662
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:28,313
one of those successfully.

663
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:33,818
Amy: that is my goal. I should
stop spending all of my time

664
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:36,612
crocheting and actually get to
work on this regex parser

665
00:42:36,612 --> 00:42:39,742
Bekah: No, let other people help
you. I wasn't saying to do it by

666
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:47,608
yourself. That's an open source
channel in slack and posts every

667
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:50,938
single one of them in there. And
we'll make it a competition.

668
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:53,967
We'll, we'll send swag to whoever
wins.

669
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:55,168
Amy: That'd be amazing.

670
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,467
Bekah: I'm having ideas again.

671
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:06,072
Amy: I'm down for it. Uh, help
would be lovely because. Knowing

672
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:10,902
all of the, uh, parts of rejects
and I've even sketched out all of

673
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:14,652
the different chunks that is
regex. I have a entire, I

674
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:18,733
couldn't, I haven't ported it to
MURAL yet. I still have it on

675
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:24,672
whimsical, but, uh, it's just
this very elaborate mind map of

676
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:28,333
how regex expressions work. Uh,

677
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:29,333
Dan: That's

678
00:43:29,413 --> 00:43:30,583
Amy: that was redundant. I said,

679
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,672
Dan: You should probably, uh,
yeah.

680
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:33,775
Bekah: It's okay.

681
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:38,740
Dan: Well, regular expression.
Expressions now, what do you call

682
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,320
an individual one. I guess he
just call it a regular

683
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,130
expression.

684
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:45,740
Amy: Yeah.

685
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,157
Dan: That's boring though. Yeah.
All right. We can fix English

686
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:54,307
later. One thing at a time.

687
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:55,768
Amy: What is English?

688
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:56,467
Bekah: W,

689
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:57,068
Dan: exactly.

690
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,670
Bekah: sorry, I didn't know what
I was

691
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,170
Dan: Yeah. You almost said
something there.

692
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,601
Bekah: And then I had a thought
and it left me.

693
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:06,358
Amy: man, I like lost the thread

694
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:07,059
Bekah: right now. It is.

695
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:07,768
Amy: thread.

696
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:14,438
Dan: Yes. Three for three in this
particular podcast for ADHD. So.

697
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:18,443
Amy: I really loved that
discussion we had on Tuesday

698
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:19,974
about ADHD. That was

699
00:44:20,268 --> 00:44:23,028
Bekah: Yes. It's my favorite
discussions when we're in a

700
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:28,188
breakout room and everybody is
talking about their ADHD and we

701
00:44:28,188 --> 00:44:32,568
go off on the best tangents. It's
just so much fun.

702
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,903
Amy: There's so much kinship to
be had from having a diverse

703
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:39,103
brain mapping.

704
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:43,347
Bekah: It is. Yeah. So, so for
those of our listeners who are

705
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,047
not there on Tuesday, they're
just kind of wrapped up. I don't

706
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:50,239
even remember how we got started
talking about ADHD, then

707
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:50,769
Amy: remember.

708
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:54,409
Bekah: a number of people had
ADHD, somebody else that they

709
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:59,028
might based on our conversation,
Yeah. Do you want to talk a

710
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,878
little bit about your experience
with ADHD?

711
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:07,293
Amy: Yeah, sure. Um, I didn't get
diagnosed with ADHD until I was

712
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:11,224
an adult. The only reason I got
diagnosed was that my husband got

713
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:16,054
diagnosed and his psychologist
was like, take this written

714
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:20,403
assessment home with you and have
your wife take it because in my

715
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:24,333
professional experience, as
someone with ADHD and who treats

716
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:28,873
people with ADHD, if you're
undiagnosed as an adult and

717
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:33,793
you're married, your spouse also
is undiagnosed with ADHD because

718
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:38,264
they're the only people that can
tolerate us for that long. And so

719
00:45:38,264 --> 00:45:42,764
I took the assessment and the
other assessment and yeah,

720
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:47,833
totally ADHD. And it was totally
mind blowing to me that like my

721
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:52,733
entire life I've had this like,
anxiety that got worse. As I got

722
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:56,724
older to the point that like I
would leave the house. And if it

723
00:45:56,724 --> 00:46:00,804
was a windy day, I would have in
the back of my mind at any point

724
00:46:01,403 --> 00:46:05,184
a tree could snap a branch and
then I'm going to be dead. Cause

725
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:08,693
the branch inevitably is going to
find the back of my cranium and

726
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:11,753
smash it and that's going to be
the end of me. And so like, I was

727
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:17,418
always looking for danger at any
situation, like. Sit in a room

728
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:21,648
with my back facing a door. It
was not a thing I could do. And

729
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:25,938
so, like I had tried to get
treated for anxiety and it just

730
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:29,599
never seemed to work. And then I
got diagnosed with ADHD. He got

731
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,344
treated for ADHD and my
psychologist was. The only reason

732
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:37,884
you have anxiety is because you
have untreated ADHD. Once we

733
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:41,304
treat that that's probably going
to go away. And that has been my

734
00:46:41,304 --> 00:46:45,713
experience. I am no longer in
anxious anxiety muffin. I am like

735
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:47,813
a normal human.

736
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,469
Bekah: I, when I was diagnosed a
couple of years ago, that the

737
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:59,268
first thing that my doctor wanted
to do was rule out he's like, is

738
00:46:59,268 --> 00:47:04,278
that ADHD? Or is it anxiety? Like
what is starting this? And so we

739
00:47:04,278 --> 00:47:09,168
started by ruling out, uh,
anxiety that was causing these

740
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,449
symptoms, uh, and then went on to
be treated for ADHD, which has

741
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:17,929
been really good and helped me to
understand things much better.

742
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:21,139
And also like how I communicate
with other people because my

743
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,648
whole family is probably
undiagnosed ADHD. And so we have

744
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:26,958
a very unique way of
communicating with each other

745
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,079
that I just thought everybody
communicated with each other in

746
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,978
that way. And that's probably why
I had a lot of problems, forming

747
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:38,119
friendships and relationships
with people because not everybody

748
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:41,208
communicates in that way
apparently. Um, but

749
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:44,554
Amy: mean, not everyone wants you
to finish their sentences,

750
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,844
Bekah: And take you on a 10
minute tangent before giving them

751
00:47:47,844 --> 00:47:48,833
a one word answer.

752
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:53,043
Amy: but you have to have set up
to stories. And sometimes those

753
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:55,923
lead you to different stories
that are tangentially related and

754
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:58,923
you have to go into those stories
and then eventually circle back

755
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:01,324
and then you forgot what the
original story was. And it's just

756
00:48:02,344 --> 00:48:04,023
that, that's just how
storytelling goes.

757
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:08,494
Bekah: I'm like one of two ways.
So either I am like that web of

758
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:12,543
storytelling or like my brain is
just very direct. So it's either

759
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,454
you get along story or I'm just
going to tell you how I feel

760
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:20,313
right now in this moment that
directness can be hard for some

761
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:25,969
people, but, but it has been good
to know that. Okay. There's a way

762
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,048
to approach this communication
with somebody else and to talk

763
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:33,409
through things, to make sure that
we are on the same page and that

764
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:38,148
we can communicate with each
other successfully. And Yeah. so

765
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,869
I always appreciate hearing other
people's stories. Actually, Dan,

766
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:45,889
when, uh, I started working with
Danny, he was talking about his

767
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:51,119
ADHD and that's how I got
diagnosed with ADHD. Oh, is that,

768
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,369
is that, is that what that is?

769
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,278
Dan: Yeah. I found out because I
read a tweet that described my

770
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:05,278
whole life and I was like, oh, I
started reading about it. No, as

771
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:09,679
I read about it a lot. And then,
um, like, you know, I was

772
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,579
consumed by obviously for a
couple weeks. And then I was

773
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:18,349
like, I went to talk to my wife
and I need to have, like, I need

774
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:22,804
to talk to you about something. I
think I have ADHD. Well, yeah.

775
00:49:24,063 --> 00:49:33,094
And I'm like, what? She's like, I
just thought you knew who else

776
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:37,143
knows. And she's like, I don't
know all your friends, anybody

777
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,074
who's met you, I guess.

778
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,443
Amy: You just thought I was
untreated on purpose.

779
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,429
Dan: Yeah. I don't know. No.
Yeah. I mean it, my, my, my, the

780
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:51,168
reason I just didn't know
anything about it, you know what

781
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:54,889
I mean? I didn't know. I had the.
Never thought about it very much

782
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,528
had to, if somebody asked me I
had the like sort of old

783
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:03,108
stereotypical, you know, idea of
what, of, what, like ADD is, you

784
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:07,278
know, that kind of thing. Um,
and, uh, well it turns out that's

785
00:50:07,278 --> 00:50:10,789
not, you know, accurate obviously
like, you know, the hyper kid who

786
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:13,998
can't run, you know, who's
running around, you know, in

787
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:16,099
school and, and making noise and
stuff, and that wasn't ever me,

788
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,239
but all of the. Everything else,
you know, made my whole life,

789
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,878
like a lot, a little more, a
little more clear, like very all

790
00:50:22,878 --> 00:50:23,329
of a sudden,

791
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:27,554
Amy: Yeah, I think that's one of
the like unfortunate parts about

792
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:31,273
add is that most people just
think of the hyperactivity as

793
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:36,873
being symptomology symptomatic.
And like the opposite is also

794
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:42,693
kind of a symptom, right? Like
daydreaming and not focusing on

795
00:50:42,693 --> 00:50:44,914
things is also a sign.

796
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:48,949
Dan: Yes, yes. Yeah. And I, yeah,
no, I, I mentioned this exact

797
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,378
experience with my doctor a
couple of days ago actually. Um,

798
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:54,409
and he's like, yeah, those are
the first kids that get

799
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:57,349
diagnosed. You know, the ones
that are disrupting class really,

800
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,469
and the teachers are like, you
have to get him assessed or, or

801
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:04,278
him or assessed, or, um, he's not
coming back. You know what I

802
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:07,159
mean? Like, and so they get
diagnosed, but the, the people

803
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:13,724
who, um, are yeah, exactly a
quiet and more. Different. Um, my

804
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:16,273
experience was just getting
labeled as well. He's smart, but

805
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,494
he's lazy or whatever, you know,
like that kind of thing, my

806
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:25,364
whole, uh, sort of school career
as it were. Uh, and, uh, yeah,

807
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:28,693
so, no, it's, it's been a very
interesting and enlightening

808
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:33,583
journey for me, but it's kinda,
it's cool. I dunno, I'd encourage

809
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,253
anybody to read more about it and
think more about it. There's

810
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:40,418
there's a lot of good resources
out there these days. Um, To

811
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:42,759
learn about it, you know? Cause
that's what I did for a couple of

812
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:45,759
weeks was just like read stuff,
you know, you don't have to be a

813
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:47,438
doctor to at least start thinking
about it,

814
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:49,989
Bekah: I just messaged Dan and
said, what should I read?

815
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,809
Dan: Yeah. Yep. And I sent her
like a, like a list of a billion

816
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:55,378
things. So.

817
00:51:56,509 --> 00:51:58,429
Bekah: I had a similar
experience. I told my

818
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:01,159
sister-in-law, I was like, I
think I have ADHD. And she's

819
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:09,829
like, oh, you didn't, you didn't
know? Oh, no, it does. It's all a

820
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:14,659
lot of rethinking of those past
experiences, but it's useful to

821
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:17,659
understand how to talk about
things and to know more about

822
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:20,748
yourself and your interactions
with other people. So, yeah. I

823
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:25,309
will second talking about it and
learning more about it. That's

824
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,469
something you think you might
have.

825
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:28,878
Amy: yeah.

826
00:52:29,204 --> 00:52:32,534
Dan: just a little shout out. If
you are in Virtual Coffee, we

831
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,739
there sometimes just posts, you
know, gifs and stuff, but it's a

832
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:52,918
good,

833
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:53,878
Bekah: Gifs? mean Jifs

834
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:58,039
Dan: No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no. We got so far. You're so

835
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:58,938
close to ending

836
00:52:59,048 --> 00:52:59,798
Bekah: We really did.

837
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:00,798
Amy: Gif one,

838
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,239
Bekah: Jiff two

839
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:06,978
Dan: Couldn't just let it

840
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,643
Amy: they're G-rafical images.

841
00:53:09,378 --> 00:53:13,699
Bekah: I can't, I like, it's
painful to my ears to hear that.

842
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,289
I'm like, what is, what is he
talking

843
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:24,753
Amy: we don't say ragexe so we
shouldn't say GIF. a hard jet.

844
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:29,108
Dan: Right checks. Oh, no, that's
going to bother me too.

845
00:53:29,114 --> 00:53:29,983
Amy: expression.

846
00:53:30,068 --> 00:53:30,278
Dan: that's

847
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,164
Amy: should be reg X, but it's
not ragexe because

848
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:34,268
Dan: it red. I reg X from now.

849
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:38,833
Amy: See, this is, this is how I
get the people who are hard

850
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:42,673
lining GIF. I'm like, Hmm, we're
not consistent.

851
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:48,393
Dan: Well, that's true. It's
again, English. So that's sort of

852
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:51,393
the only consistent thing is that
it's inconsistent

853
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:52,891
Bekah: Well, Amy,

854
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,166
Dan: English major right here,
English.

855
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:56,581
Bekah: I'm an English. major.

856
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:57,867
Dan: Okay. Well

857
00:53:58,442 --> 00:54:00,661
Bekah: master's in English,
masters.

858
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,007
Dan: yes, no, we fight about this
quite a bit.

859
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:08,637
Bekah: Never stops.

860
00:54:10,992 --> 00:54:11,262
Dan: Oh

861
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:16,047
Bekah: I was going to say, thanks
Amy, for being here today. Um,

862
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:22,436
and in, during this conversation
with us, uh, this has been fun

863
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:25,556
and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Is
there anything else you want to

864
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:30,166
share or any last words of wisdom
you would like to leave for our

865
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:30,677
listeners?

866
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,204
Amy: Good question, which is how
I preface everything. Cause I

867
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,894
need to think about it. And, uh,
I would, I would just say that,

868
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:42,425
you know, times are hard, but we
don't have to be and like try to

869
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:46,985
be kind to other people, even if
it it's hard sometimes.

870
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,019
Bekah: It's like, if they're
saying GIF,

871
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:53,289
Amy: Like, if they're saying GIF
and you want them to say Jif or

872
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,000
they're saying ragexe and you
want them to say regex.

873
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,739
Compassion.

874
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:00,385
Dan: Compassion.

875
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,059
Bekah: I'm sorry. I ruined that
it was like very meaningful and

876
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,699
great and I could not stop
myself.

877
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,659
Amy: I understand the impulse.
Well, I can't even say anything.

878
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:12,739
it all the time.

879
00:55:13,342 --> 00:55:15,771
Bekah: All right. Thanks so much,
Amy. And we will talk to you

880
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:16,101
soon.

881
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:17,021
