00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,284
Bekah: Hello, and welcome back
to the Virtual Coffee Podcast.

2
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:15,969
I'm

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,559
Bekah. And this is a podcast
that features members of the

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,148
Virtual

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,420
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee
is an intimate group of

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,950
developers at all stages of
their coding journey. And

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,480
they're here

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,910
on this podcast, sharing their
stories. And what they've

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,100
learned. Here with me today is
my cohost, Dan.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,024
Dan: Hey, Bekah. Um, season
three, that's exciting. We had a

11
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,394
really great season two. We
heard from all sorts of people.

12
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:40,764
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,914
We had a lot of great
conversations. Um, in the last

14
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,375
season, you know, we talked a
lot about finding your voice and

15
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:49,604
building confidence as a
developer. And I heard a lot of

16
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,604
great stories from different
people and it was a blast. And

17
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:53,574
we

18
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,054
are pumped to be back for season
three with some great episodes

19
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:00,695
Bekah: I am very excited to be
back too. And I thought would be

20
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,371
Dan: We're pumped,

21
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:09,506
Bekah: Okay. I am excited and
you are pumped. Okay.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,930
Dan: very pumped.

23
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,166
Bekah: Very excited. As we move
into season three of the

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,117
podcast,

25
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,692
I thought it would be fun to
talk a little bit about what

26
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,267
we've

27
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:29,037
learned as podcast co-hosts. I
think we can talk about all of

28
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:29,608
the seasons

29
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,932
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, w
when did our first episode air

30
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,527
in

31
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,897
January, something like that. So
it's been half a year or

32
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,742
whatever. Um, I've I've learned
a lot. I've learned a ton from

33
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:43,587
the

34
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,677
technical perspective. Um, you
know, producing this, you know,

35
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,668
with, with you is, has been, I
don't just like the new thing to

36
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:58,677
learn every, every week. Uh, it
seems like, um, and it's now I'm

37
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,042
at the point where I know all
the things I don't know, you

38
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,407
know

39
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,557
what I mean? Like, you know,
sound quality stuff, editing,

40
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,706
um,

41
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:11,902
things like that. I, I, uh, I've
gotten. To the point where I can

42
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:16,212
do it, you know what I mean? And
so now it's like, now I know all

43
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,517
the things I don't know, or at
least I know that there are a

44
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:18,801
lot

45
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:20,092
of things. I don't know, you
know what I mean? Um, but it's

46
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:21,382
been

47
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,752
fun. I feel like I've been, I've
been at least from the technical

48
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,782
standpoint of, you know, podcast
stuff. Um, kind of getting my

49
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:30,622
feet under me. Um, so that
part's been cool

50
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,957
Bekah: I can start the intros
without laughing all the time.

51
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:35,182
Dan: Yeah,

52
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,027
Bekah: Most of the time.

53
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,562
Dan: I feel like we we've been
using Zencaster and they

54
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:40,722
released

55
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:43,782
a new version of their software,
which was pretty cool, which we

56
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,962
enjoyed a lot. Um, and they have
a countdown thing now. So when

57
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,423
you hit this, you, when you hit
start record, there's a little

58
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,663
countdown. And I feel like that
almost helps us, you know, cause

59
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:56,353
you, I dunno. I feel like that
was where we get tripped up is

60
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,693
cause it hit record and then
there'd be some pause and nobody

61
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,793
knows if they're supposed to
talk or not. You know? So it's a

62
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,862
small, small touch. I feel like
that has helped us.

63
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,332
Bekah: Yeah, well, I think
getting more comfortable to, you

64
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:08,483
know, in the beginning, it was
just, it's different being

65
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:13,612
interviewed for on a podcast
than interviewing other people,

66
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:16,192
because you have a different
role as a host and you're there

67
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:18,741
to try

68
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,473
and tell the story. And I think
it took a little while for me to

69
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:24,712
kind of wrap my head around that
and maybe going into season

70
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:27,187
three, I feel like I've got a
better grasp on storytelling as

71
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,662
a

72
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:31,788
podcast. Rather than like, okay,
I have this list of questions

73
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,913
and

74
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,532
we have to hit all the
questions. Like we have some

75
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,151
backup

76
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,462
questions, but where is the
conversation going and how can

77
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,772
we

78
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,673
keep that up and tell the story
of the person on the show and

79
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,832
think about what, what would
benefit anyone who's listening

80
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,751
to

81
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:50,393
the podcast?

82
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:56,027
Dan: Absolutely. Yeah. From the,
from the host point of view, I

83
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,622
have, uh, I don't know, I felt
like I've, I've tried to learn a

84
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,143
lot too, and I'm at the same
point where it's like, okay, now

85
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,782
I can see the things, you know,
that I don't quite do well or

86
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:09,793
that I, you know, think I can
improve on. Um, and you know,

87
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,252
some of them it's clear how to
fix and some of them, some of

88
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,592
them, it's not always, but, uh,
it's, I don't know. It's a

89
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:18,583
journey and, um, it's, it's been
fun. It's been, and it's also, I

90
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,333
mean, everybody that we talk to
are people that we like and are

91
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,663
part of our community and, you
know, they're friends, some of

92
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:27,117
them close friends, some of
them, you know, new friends, um,

93
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,571
for

94
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,692
me. And, uh, it's been just a
blast to be able to talk to

95
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,838
everybody and learn more about
them personally, too, and

96
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,593
hearing

97
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:40,942
everybody's origin stories and,
um, crazy, uh, boat plane

98
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:46,622
training incidents and, uh, you
know, just hearing more about

99
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,857
from, you know, from people's
lives. Um, it's one of the

100
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:51,061
things

101
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,607
that I like and that I like
about the, um, in our, in a

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,152
Virtual

103
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,023
Coffee, is when these
conversations get off track and

104
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:01,762
not off track, but, uh, get
whatever, you know, that don't

105
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,457
have a track. Right. Um, like
you were saying. And, um, I feel

106
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,152
like

107
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:07,452
those always ended up being the
most valuable conversation. So

108
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:08,737
Bekah: Yeah, I love it.

109
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,452
Dan: And it's been cool trying
to apply it here.

110
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:16,153
Bekah: I love chasing a tangent.
It's a good time. And usually

111
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,862
come out with something
interesting, at least.

112
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:20,353
Dan: Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

113
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:25,072
Bekah: And it has been fun. You
know, getting to know people a

114
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,403
lot better and to learn about
their lives and the things that

115
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,772
they've gone through. It's
really been great for me. Like

116
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,141
you said,

117
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,900
there, there are things that you
take away from. Every episode

118
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,627
and

119
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,918
every person that we talked to.
And I just love that after we're

120
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:43,573
done recording a podcast for
every season where we've

121
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,228
recorded

122
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,687
almost all of the third season,
but there's always been

123
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,117
something

124
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,478
in every episode that I've taken
away and just thought about for

125
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,048
the rest of the week. And it's
really helped to inform the way

126
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,778
that I've done things and the
approaches I take. So it's been

127
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,237
great to be able to have that
live learning experience.

128
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,075
Dan: Yeah, I agree. And they,
uh, it's just been like little

129
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,752
tiny

130
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:12,927
breakout rooms with just you and
me and one other person. Um,

131
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,102
and,

132
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:19,012
uh, it's, it's been really very
cool, very cool experience. And

133
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,382
I'm excited about season three.

134
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:22,992
Bekah: Yeah, we're really
excited to be sharing this

135
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,372
season with

136
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:25,932
you all too. Um, we're going to
be talking about recognizing

137
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,492
your

138
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:29,997
potential, navigating
interviews, overcoming career

139
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,502
stagnation, how

140
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:35,653
to do a proper Tim Tam Slam, and
a lot more.

141
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,647
Dan: That's right. So kicking
off season three, episode one,

142
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,357
we

143
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,918
have Jono Yeong. Jono is a
senior software engineer. He's

144
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,487
originally from Australia. I is
currently based in Seattle, um,

145
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,822
USA. And he. Okay. So he's
primarily a backend developer,

146
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,673
but is enjoying re-entering the
crazy world of front end

147
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:56,548
development. He loves giving
back to communities and

148
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,423
empowering

149
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:01,963
others on their developer
journeys and, um, without such a

150
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,378
supportive community, he
wouldn't be where he is today.

151
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,793
Uh, and he

152
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:11,543
says, hashbrowns are his guilty
pleasure food. Um, and so, yes,

153
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,872
so today he'll be talking to us
about, digital gardening,

154
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,512
learning elixir, and how to do a
proper Tim Tam Slam.

155
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,918
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

156
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,918
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

157
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,003
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question.

158
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,088
Today's

159
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,533
random check-in question is if
you could have one person

160
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,978
narrate

161
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:45,093
your life, who would it be? Hey,
I'm Bekah. I'm a front end

162
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:51,454
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And I am going to change

163
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:54,651
the question a little bit, cause
I feel like it. I am. I decided

164
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,848
I

165
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:02,889
didn't want a narrator, I wanted
a musical background and I would

166
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,569
just like to choose everyone
that sing in Frozen 2 musical

167
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,629
background to just sing my life
story for me, because that

168
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:13,689
seemed

169
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,158
more fun.

170
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:18,994
Dan: Sure. That would be cool.
So is. It makes me think of

171
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,244
Monty

172
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:23,263
Python. Like the, uh, the, the
guy, what is his name, Sir

173
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,282
Robin?

174
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,324
you know, the guy following
around Sir Robin: "so boldly

175
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,863
goes, Sir Bekah, she's doing
something. I don't know. I can't

176
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:32,348
think of it, but like, yeah, I
like that musical narration I

177
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:33,833
can

178
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,684
get by that. Um, hi, I'm Dan. I
do front-end development. Um,

179
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,384
I'm

180
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:44,349
in Cleveland, Ohio, and if I had
to pick a narrator. I was

181
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,869
thinking for a couple of minutes
about this. And, uh, honestly,

182
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:50,649
Sean Connery is who I landed on.
Um, I think it'd be pretty cool.

183
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,528
I, and I just listened to a
podcast about, um, The Rock, the

184
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,448
movie and, um, w which of course
he's, he's in it. And that made

185
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:02,188
me think, oh, man, what about
Nick Cage narrating your life?

186
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:06,808
Which, um, would be, uh, would
be, it could be pretty

187
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:07,993
interesting too. Um, I'm
sticking with it. I'm sticking

188
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,178
with, uh,

189
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,774
Sean Connery, but I, I. I would
like to know what that would

190
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,384
sound like, Nick Cage just kind
of narrating somebodies life in

191
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:15,563
their head.

192
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:20,073
Jono: I feel like that's like
two very opposing voices

193
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,453
Dan: Right, right. Yeah. Right.
Which is why that movie is so

194
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:22,903
good, you know?

195
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:29,364
Jono: Yeah. Oh, amazing. Um, hi,
I'm Jonathan. Uh, I am a senior

196
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:34,594
developer at Shopify currently
based in Seattle and jeez, Bekah

197
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,583
threw the curveball and with a
musical number. I am not that

198
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,964
musical, so you're totally fine.
Um, I, you know, I think I would

199
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:45,624
get a fictional character being
Yoda potentially could get

200
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:47,033
annoying after a while, but, you
know, I think there would be

201
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,442
like

202
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,183
wisdom. Right there. And then a
real person, Nick Offerman. I

203
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,818
just hope he laughs at some
point during my life story. Just

204
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:56,453
to get

205
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,104
that sound clipping

206
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:02,583
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. He's he has an
excellent laugh, um, with the

207
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,004
Yoda. yeah, It be worth even.
I'd be, I mean, it would be like

208
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:11,599
great, you know, um, sound wise.
That Yoda would be, just be

209
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,349
judging me all the time.

210
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:13,573
Jono: yeah,

211
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,943
Bekah: I feel like you'd really
have to pay attention. Like you

212
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,224
have to think. Cause he wouldn't
straight forward narrate what

213
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:22,754
would happen? He would just be
dropping Yoda wisdom about what

214
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:23,354
happened

215
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,668
Jono: Yeah, I think he'd make my
life sound

216
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:27,163
Bekah: I don't know.

217
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:28,379
Jono: Yeah.

218
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:35,778
Bekah: I have enough of those
already. Um, so welcome, Jono,

219
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:38,879
we're very happy to have you
here on this third season of the

220
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,773
virtual PA Virtual Coffee
podcast and doing an excellent

221
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:44,667
job

222
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:47,128
already. Um, so we really like
to start with a little bit of

223
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,588
the

224
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,839
background, your origin story.
So if you could give us your

225
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,089
short

226
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,038
version of how you got to this
point in your.

227
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:03,389
Jono: yeah. Um, I have a pretty
boring or I guess standard

228
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,938
technical background. Um, so I
did a four year degree at

229
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:10,644
university, um, interned at a
company. Um, but during that

230
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:13,113
time, and then at the company, I
was doing iOS work initially,

231
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:15,582
um,

232
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,134
for a few months, and then they
got me on a Ruby on Rails

233
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,134
project. And that's really when
I really fell in love with web

234
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,494
development and decided to kind
of pursue that route. So from

235
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:28,094
there went to kind of be another
kind of Ruby on Rails shop in

236
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:31,244
Sydney. So I'm originally from
Australia. Uh, and then I

237
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,638
actually moved to the States.
Um, so working with Rails all

238
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,032
the way

239
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,453
through and uh, yeah, now I'm in
Seattle and now on Shopify.

240
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:40,833
Bekah: I don't feel like I could
have you narrate my life, you

241
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,228
and

242
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,928
Mike Rogers, like can we go back
and forth between the two. It

243
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,428
would be a very happy time for
me.

244
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,124
Jono: just so much happiness.

245
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:55,668
Bekah: Um, well that, that is
awesome. And we are glad to have

246
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,969
you at Virtual Coffee. I don't
remember when you joined Virtual

247
00:11:58,969 --> 00:11:59,958
Coffee do you?

248
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,388
Jono: Um, I, I D I remember, I
remember the circumstances. I

249
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,863
was

250
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:10,283
in a Code Newbie chat. And I was
talking about seeing Virtual

251
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,984
Coffee and I tweeted about it.
They're like, Hey, this seems

252
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,424
like a really cool community.
And then I think you mentioned,

253
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:15,864
you

254
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:19,474
tweet at me saying like, Hey,
come join at this time. And, and

255
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,638
let's yeah, I think it all
kicked off and spent almost

256
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,693
maybe like

257
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:27,053
six months, maybe more. I don't
know. I can't, but it's time.

258
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:27,524
Bekah: Right.

259
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,874
Dan: Yeah. we were, we, we just,
uh, recorded our podcast

260
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,884
episode,

261
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,528
wrapping up, um, season two,
right. We're talking about that

262
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,778
too. Like looking back on time.
And I was just, I just kept

263
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,593
throwing out random numbers of
months. Cause I literally, I

264
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,408
have

265
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,889
no idea. I have no idea. It was,
uh, you know, it was after the

266
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,989
pandemic started. I know that
much. And then after that, I'm

267
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,678
just like, I don't know. It's
all just a big cloud.

268
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,738
Bekah: Yeah. Um, so one of the
things that I think would be

269
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,943
cool

270
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,718
to talk about, I know you
updated your site yesterday or

271
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:01,493
sometime,

272
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,683
and it looks really awesome. So
we'll post that in the show

273
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,903
notes, but you, um, there's this
concept of digital gardening

274
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,123
that

275
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,994
you talk about, and I think you
practice, so I'd love to start

276
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:16,793
there. First of all, what is,
what, what does that even mean?

277
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,573
Digital gardening.

278
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:22,484
Jono: Yeah. Um, so digital
gardening is really about

279
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:27,673
curating your posts. Like you
don't need to have fully formed

280
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:32,918
or finished. Um, written work.
It's, it's really about having a

281
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,393
thought and then building on
that thought over time. Um, and

282
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,868
it's

283
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,038
kind of the opposite of a blog,
which is almost like a feed with

284
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,068
that sorted in chronological
order. Um, so with your digital

285
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,469
garden, you kind of pick and
choose what you want to present

286
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:51,448
up front. And it's really about
that curation. Um, I definitely.

287
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:54,754
Got heavily inspired by Maggie
Appleton. So definitely go check

288
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:59,283
out her blog as well, which is
also a digital garden. Um, her

289
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,533
artwork is beautiful and she
explains it really well over

290
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:01,774
there.

291
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,389
Dan: Yeah. I've seen a couple
other examples like that and

292
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:09,048
Maggie Appleton site that is the
first one I, I think I saw too,

293
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,448
um, they don't let it out of
this whole concept. I think

294
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:11,797
that's

295
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:16,323
really cool. So do you, um, And
this is something I've been sort

296
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,403
of interested in for a while
too, but, um, haven't really,

297
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,483
you

298
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:23,014
know, my blog is old and I don't
update it that often. Um, but it

299
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,754
is still like old, you know,
that regular style. Um, so when

300
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:26,494
you're

301
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,274
doing like the curation process,
right, for older posts, do you

302
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,439
just re like remove them or
what, like, or do you tuck them

303
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,604
away

304
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:35,878
somewhere or, uh, you know,
like, can you explain a little

305
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:37,152
more

306
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,614
about how you handle like that
sort of stuff that maybe isn't

307
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:42,364
super relevant anymore, but, you
did write it, you know, five

308
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,203
years ago or something.

309
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:45,163
Jono: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Um, so I think the curation in

310
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:47,023
my

311
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:48,569
mind, uh, yes, to some posts
going away. So I actually

312
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,114
removed

313
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:53,533
a bunch of posts that, um, when
I was migrating over to this new

314
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:56,486
site redesign. And then also,
um, being okay with putting a

315
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:59,378
big

316
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,129
"work in progress" box. So it
actually on the, uh, I have a

317
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,839
post about GitHub and Notion and
notion this was pre Notions API,

318
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,288
and this was really just about
how I organize our projects. Um,

319
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:15,399
but. Now that Notion has an API,
it would make a lot of sense to

320
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,889
make something, wake it up and
nurse, and actually talk to each

321
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,374
other. So I put it like a big
alert and box saying like, Hey,

322
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:20,859
I

323
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,489
am going to be working on this.
Um, you expect things to change

324
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:28,578
Dan: So as you update that post
and I did I read that post, I

325
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,249
really enjoyed it. Um, as you
update it, plan is what will be

326
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,849
to literally update that post as
opposed to doing a part two or

327
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,818
see this or whatever. Um, things
like that.

328
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,639
Jono: Yeah, exactly.

329
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,979
Dan: That's, that's pretty
interesting. And it is, and like

330
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,094
I have seen other people do it.
It's it's, uh, There's the

331
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:52,874
question of like time with
regards to technical content,

332
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,153
especially, it's always sort of
interested in to try to handle,

333
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:59,323
right. And I have, um, one of my
...and I mean, a lot of this is

334
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,988
because I don't write that
often, but still one of the

335
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:02,653
posts on my

336
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:06,703
site that gets the most traffic
is, um, some old CSS like float

337
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,104
hack thing, you know? And it's
still like, I mean, it still

338
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,588
works, but it's like, you know,
not at all anything, I would

339
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,072
tell

340
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:17,594
somebody to do now. You know
what I mean? Um, and yeah. I've

341
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,619
thought about, I've thought
about how to handle that or, um,

342
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,644
so,

343
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:25,274
so, so if this was a digital
garden, I suppose the answer

344
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:29,624
would be to, uh, well, either
toss it and just point them back

345
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:32,203
to the main page. Right. Or just
rewrite the whole article at

346
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,782
that

347
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,823
same URL or something like that.

348
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,943
Jono: Yeah, I mean, you, um, I
mean, you can keep that old

349
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,353
posts

350
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,693
around, like it's, it's really
your playground. You can really

351
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,713
do whatever you want with it.
Um, there's no really hard and

352
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:44,733
fast

353
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:48,573
rules. Um, I think like if you
wanted to toss it or update it

354
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:49,788
and utility could, you could
also write like, uh, a new

355
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,003
update

356
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:54,634
paste. I think the key idea is
really just not waiting for

357
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,563
perfect to publish. So you don't
need to, you can just publish a

358
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,581
thought. And it will be okay.
Um, and I think this reminds me

359
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,599
of

360
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,898
someone in Virtual Coffee, maybe
it was Vic, who just did a timer

361
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,388
and was like, I'm just gonna
write what I can. And by the end

362
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,699
of the time, I'm just gonna
publish this. I think that like,

363
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,098
feels like that digital garden
essence to me,

364
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:16,108
Dan: Yeah, Vic has been doing a
lot of that kind of stuff. And

365
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:18,929
he's been someone that I've
admired his work with that too,

366
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,348
that the not perfect. The, uh,
get, get it out the door kind of

367
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,298
get published. Um, thing has
been, has been really cool. Um,

368
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,218
I

369
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,409
would say inspirational. I don't
know if you can be inspired if

370
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,068
you haven't actually gone and
done it. I mean, I haven't

371
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:35,148
actually gone, um, done anything
with it, but it is, uh, it is

372
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:39,344
cool to see. I do like that
attitude, you know? Um,

373
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:43,513
Bekah: I mean, for me, the hard
part would be going back and

374
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:48,973
updating things. Like I get them
out and then I don't, this is, I

375
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:52,094
mean, I have a master's in
English and it was the same

376
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,471
thing. Like I, I got excited. I
wrote the paper and then. Like

377
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,848
to

378
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:04,048
go back and edit was the worst.
So I don't know, like how do you

379
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,959
motivate yourself to do that? Or
are you like, well, I'm not

380
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,878
motivated. So then this isn't
something that I need and you

381
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,797
can

382
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,759
take it away or just say, like,
this is a weed,

383
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,364
Jono: Yeah. Yeah. That's a great
question. I think it's, it's

384
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,956
definitely going to be. A work
in progress as in like, I'm

385
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:21,548
still

386
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:26,019
trying to figure out that, um,
process a little bit more. Um, I

387
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,594
know that when I was trying to
write like a blog post every

388
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:29,169
week

389
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,848
or every two weeks, and just
trying to like push out a new

390
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:34,739
content, it became. Really hard.
And I was in a bit of a rut.

391
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,989
Like, it just felt like I was
going from deadline to deadline.

392
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,818
So like giving space to not need
to write a new post every single

393
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:45,419
week, but be okay with like
updating whole pace, mainly just

394
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,939
also I'm lazy. So like, it'd be
nice if we could just tell you

395
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:48,974
something that's already rating
and then just add a little bit

396
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,009
to

397
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,229
it as, okay. So like writing a
whole thing thing.

398
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,191
Dan: Yeah, I was. You know,
speaking of doing that, you

399
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,673
know,

400
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,344
lots of people will make a goal
like that, of a blog post or

401
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:01,814
whatever. I think that, you
know, thinking about it, it

402
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,284
seems to me

403
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:05,084
like the most important part is
actually just writing, like the

404
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:10,453
habit of writing and publishing
something every week is, uh, you

405
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,334
know, sort of a straightforward
goal right. To do. But I was

406
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:16,334
listening to podcasts, uh, maybe
the indie hackers one a while

407
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:19,423
ago. And, uh, they're talking
about, I don't remember who the

408
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,713
guest was, but he was talking
about, um, like long form

409
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:22,003
writing

410
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,844
instead of, um, instead of lots
of lots. Posts, you know, one

411
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:28,423
post that takes them months to
do, and it's long, you know, a

412
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:31,034
long read or whatever, but that
they found it to be much more,

413
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:33,209
um, for himself like writing,
uh, to be, to be much more

414
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,384
enjoyable,

415
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,928
which I, which I've been
interested in too recently. And

416
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,472
I

417
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,203
th I feel like that could fit
really well into the digital

418
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:42,538
garden model, because you could
even do your drafts if you

419
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:43,873
wanted

420
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:46,678
to, um, or parts or whatever,
you know, and keep it going. Uh,

421
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:49,482
like

422
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,058
that'd be kind of cool to see.
It would be cool to see it like.

423
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:52,633
To

424
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:55,634
like, watch it grow. You know,
if we're going to keep down the,

425
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,374
the, like the metaphor, the
garden metaphor.

426
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,528
Jono: Yeah, I really liked that
point of, um, you know, doing

427
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,628
what you enjoy, because I think
that is really the key to it

428
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,728
all.

429
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,338
Like you could write deadlines,
you could have deadlines and

430
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,979
write blog posts, but like, if
there's no way or like, you're

431
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,348
just doing it because you have
to, it's not that fun, then

432
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,368
you're not going to keep doing
it.

433
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:15,224
Dan: Right, right. I mean,
that's been my that's my, my

434
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:16,574
personal

435
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:19,168
experiences a lot of times.
Yeah. Things. And like, that's

436
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,762
what,

437
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:24,523
that's one of the reasons why
it's good to build habits, you

438
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,848
know, because the, sometimes
it's just over, it's hard to sit

439
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:29,173
down

440
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,483
and write, you know, but if it's
like a thing you're used to

441
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:37,288
doing, then. Then that part is
not hard anymore. And then it's

442
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:40,199
like, well then it's actually
writing that you have to deal

443
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,359
with, but it's your mind makes
it not as big of a deal. At

444
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,519
least

445
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:44,759
for me.

446
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,044
Bekah: And I liked the point
about like, writing what you

447
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:49,483
enjoy, because I also see a lot
of people that are writing

448
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:50,922
things

449
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,573
that they don't enjoy and they
hate doing it, but they just

450
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,223
keep

451
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,743
doing it. Cause they think that
they need to do it, which just,

452
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,698
um, just sounds really
miserable. So how do you find w

453
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,143
okay, one,

454
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,864
what do you enjoy writing about,
like, how do you go after that?

455
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,493
When you're writing.

456
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:11,913
Jono: Yeah. Um, man, that is a
great question. So I've figured

457
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:15,723
out that I really don't enjoy
writing tutorials. Um, they take

458
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:21,574
me a lot of time and I feel like
I don't do it very well, so

459
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:24,153
there's that. Um, but I think
like, what am I most enjoy is

460
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:27,693
really just exploring new tech
and then just kind of getting

461
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:31,979
into like, How I align and what
my process is. So I really like

462
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,969
writing about personal stuff as
opposed to like technological

463
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:36,298
stuff.

464
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,074
Bekah: Do you think that you
write, or would you say that.

465
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:46,874
Right, because you think you
should be writing as a developer

466
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:50,653
just to kind of, um, extend
yourself into the community or

467
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:54,013
it's just something that, that
you want to.

468
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,308
Jono: yeah, it actually started
off being like, oh, I should be

469
00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,538
doing this. You know, I should
be writing. You should have a

470
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:00,768
blog,

471
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,548
just so you get the exposure and
you can tweet about something.

472
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:08,028
Um, but it's kind of
transitioning a bit more into

473
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:09,438
like, I'm trying to find the
enjoyment out of writing and

474
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,848
like

475
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:15,138
figuring out like why I like
doing this and then realizing

476
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:18,388
that. Writing or getting better
at writing and reading

477
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,638
communication, just kind of
everywhere. Like it's pervasive.

478
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:22,513
It's not just in a blog post.
Um, but like, I'll do this at

479
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:24,357
work

480
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,459
where I'm writing documentation
and like emails and stuff like

481
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,159
that. Like that's all really
important. And I've only really

482
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,888
just started realizing that a
year ago or something

483
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:37,163
Bekah: Yeah. So I talked to the
tech interview study group a

484
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:40,943
couple of months ago, and we, I
was talking about networking and

485
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,096
one of the things that I said
was that. A lot of times we have

486
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,249
this

487
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:49,719
very, um, narrow idea of what
networking is, but in our

488
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,868
industry and the things that we
do, we can create a wider

489
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:57,669
network. So networking can be
writing a blog post or tweeting,

490
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,298
or, you know, like curating that
digital garden. And so that

491
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:03,818
allows you to have a community
that you don't know. And

492
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:06,219
sometimes it's really fun to
like, especially at virtual.

493
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,398
Someone will come and be like,
oh, I read your post this one

494
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:13,088
time. You're like, oh, that's
cool. Um, so it was really nice

495
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:17,469
to kind of extend yourself out
there and in kind of meet people

496
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:18,429
without even knowing it.

497
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,130
Jono: totally agree.

498
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:23,502
Dan: I was just looking back at
your blog posts. So in your, for

499
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,992
the readers, I will obviously
post this, but, um, the blog

500
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:29,032
posts you were talking about how
you use Notion and, um, GitHub

501
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:34,333
Projects together right. To, to,
to track side projects. So, um,

502
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,603
so one thing I was, I was just
like, kind of curious about was,

503
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:40,692
um, what, like what you like to
do with side projects or what

504
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:42,932
kind of things do you have going
on? Are they, I don't are they,

505
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:46,022
are they just like fun? Are they
like hobbies? Are they, um, you

506
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,712
know, possible revenue sources
like that sort of thing. Um, I

507
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,542
was wondering kind of how you
approach, um, the side project

508
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:51,992
life.

509
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,998
Jono: Yeah. Yeah. That's uh,
yeah. I have a lot of, I think,

510
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:59,567
fun side projects and there's a
lot that I've just started and

511
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,317
like have never like finished or
touched after the initial start.

512
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,507
Um, as I'm sure a lot of
developers do. Um, but yeah,

513
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,336
most

514
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,397
of them are around like how, how
can I learn this thing? So we'll

515
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,627
have a sub project around like a
concept or something like that.

516
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:16,603
Want to learn. Um, I hate, so
this is where, cause I am on a

517
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:19,153
visa, so it's kind of weird. I
don't know if I can actually add

518
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,553
another revenue stream. So I
haven't really been pushing

519
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:25,992
towards like doing that stuff.
Um, but yeah, that's, that's

520
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:26,353
where I am.

521
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:30,103
Dan: That is interesting. I have
no idea. I mean, I have no idea

522
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:31,167
how that works. Probably a good
thing to check out, I suppose,

523
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,231
if

524
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:33,687
you were going to, if you were
going to step into that, but,

525
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,142
um,

526
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,182
honestly, maybe it might, that
might make, uh, some of your

527
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:38,982
decision-making easier could,
right? Cause you don't have to

528
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,442
think about it. Don't have to,
don't have to worry about that

529
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:44,502
part. Uh, you know, for awhile
that's kind of fun. Is there any

530
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:47,323
specific one that you've been
into recently? Any of your side

531
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:47,682
projects?

532
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:51,736
Jono: Yeah. So, um, well this
personal website was, I guess a

533
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:54,472
side project, just because like
I was building svelte kit, um,

534
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:55,942
something that I've never really
built before I'll use before.

535
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,412
Um,

536
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,282
and then on the other side, I'm
learning a bit more about Lixa

537
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:04,923
ElixirPhoenix. So I've been
building. This thing that I'm

538
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:08,913
trying to document on YouTube,
which is a, uh, like a, a social

539
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:11,923
media app for, for puppies. I
don't know if that makes sense,

540
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:13,577
not, but essentially it's like,
you can, you have like a bunch

541
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:15,182
of

542
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:18,303
puppies that you add to the side
and you can follow dogs and you

543
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:20,792
can have like little meetups and
stuff. That's, that's the grand

544
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,192
idea, but it's really just about
a learning project.

545
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:24,613
Dan: That's that's

546
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,892
Bekah: Can you just talk a
little bit about what elixir is?

547
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,022
Just

548
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:32,563
give some definitions for the
things that you talked about.

549
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:36,067
Jono: Yeah, no, that's great.
Um, so Elixir is a functional

550
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,478
programming language. Um, it's
written by José Valim and it has

551
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:43,160
a lot of. Um, Ruby ish syntax.
So if you come from Ruby, you

552
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,842
kinda,

553
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:47,733
you feel like that initial layer
feels a little like Ruby, um,

554
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:49,323
but

555
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:51,482
then when you really dig down
into it, it's all about

556
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,167
functional programming
languages. So, uh, immutability

557
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,852
is kind of

558
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,567
like a, a big component of it.
Yeah, there's all these like

559
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:01,377
little extra features. Um, and
the language itself is an

560
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:05,637
interpreted language. So it's
built on top of Erlang. Um, so

561
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:09,988
think like Ruby is kind of built
on top of C almost. Um, so

562
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,758
everything can compile as down
to Erlang.

563
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,883
Dan: That's pretty cool. Yeah.
There's a lot of, a lot of

564
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,702
interest in the functional
programming languages, you know,

565
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:22,998
uh, space, you know, these days,
which, which I enjoy. You know,

566
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,917
on a nerd level, I haven't
really dug into any of them. Um,

567
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,687
you

568
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,738
know, I know Kirk is into shoot.
I can't remember it was called,

569
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:31,278
um,

570
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:37,472
Jono: uh, F no, no shop hassle.
No, throwing out

571
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:37,768
Dan: uh,

572
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,182
Bekah: No.

573
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:39,692
Jono: Nice.

574
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:43,678
Dan: it's just silly because I
actually like contributed to it.

575
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,337
Project and I can't, I'm totally
blank on the name. I'm sorry.

576
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:51,117
I'll come up with it. Um, but
anyway, it's, it's, uh, I don't

577
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,758
know. It's neat. The functional
stuff I really enjoyed when I, I

578
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,228
did computer science for a
couple of years in, um, in

579
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:56,698
college and

580
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,178
enjoyed it. There was a language
called scheme that we used, um,

581
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:03,178
in school and it was just fun. I
don't know. It's neat. It's a,

582
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:05,127
it's a cool little, uh,
paradigm. Um, I ended up, I

583
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,076
ended up, uh,

584
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,492
in JavaScript. JavaScript itself
is not functional, like

585
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,817
strictly,

586
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:15,403
but you can. You can like lean
that way pretty hard, you know,

587
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:18,133
it's, it's fun. It's kind of fun
to, to do that.

588
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:22,157
Jono: Yeah, absolutely. I think
those, like, I see the whole

589
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:25,228
reason why I moved. Like started
learning about Elixir was, cause

590
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:29,577
I kinda was burned by, by few
things in Ruby and JavaScript

591
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:32,157
where it was mutable, but it
wasn't obvious that it was

592
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:35,428
mutable. Um, like the example
comes to mind, which is I was

593
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,928
working on my personal site. Um,
was the JavaScript Sort(), it

594
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,963
like sorts in place and it
changes the underlying object

595
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,718
and

596
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,387
it just like break everything.
Yes.

597
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:50,053
Dan: Yep. Yep. Uh, yeah. Thank
you, Bekah Elm. It was, uh, it

598
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:54,073
was Elm. That was the language I
was talking about. Um, the, Yes.

599
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:58,182
uh, I came up with, uh, on PHP,
uh, and it's even more absurd

600
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:00,673
than JavaScript in that regard.
It's got a lot better, but, um,

601
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:04,333
yeah. Uh, you know, the, you
never really know if it's going

602
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,162
to be like, if it's gonna
mutate. Object and place or

603
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,991
return a new

604
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:09,687
on it. It does both really. And
so, yeah, I see you like you

605
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,382
get,

606
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,197
you get the new one and you
think in cool, but you know, you

607
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:14,952
go

608
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,452
back to the old one, it turns
out that one's changed. It's not

609
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:17,952
fun.

610
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:21,717
Uh, PHP also has like, they, I
mean, they, like I said,

611
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:23,982
they've,

612
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:27,272
they've improved a lot, but, um,
you know, all these different

613
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,537
array functions, some of them
came from Perl and some came

614
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:29,802
from

615
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,647
like, C, and so named, like,
there was like, you never knew

616
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,491
if

617
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:37,647
it was gonna be array underscore
sort or like. With no array and,

618
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,077
you know, like all this
nonsense, uh, that I loved, but,

619
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:42,297
um, it was

620
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:44,057
very hard to deal with it as
well. Sometimes. Yes.

621
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,003
Jono: How do people write
programs back then? Like, I

622
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:47,048
don't

623
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:47,508
understand.

624
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:50,192
Dan: Yeah. Um, like lots of,
lots of, you know, trying and

625
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,247
failing

626
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:55,698
and lots of bugs that nobody
knows about until it's so much

627
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,733
later and you know, all that
sort of stuff, no tests, FTP,

628
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,768
you

629
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,907
know, hit save, and then FTP up
to the server and see if It.

630
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,343
works. Uh, that's how I did it.
Anyway. I don't know.

631
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:10,292
Bekah: When I was first building
my blog, I didn't know that you

632
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:15,063
could run things locally. And I
also didn't know, like, so I was

633
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:19,262
just like committing things and
seeing if they worked or not. So

634
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:23,702
I don't even want to go back to
when I first started that repo

635
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:25,502
because all of the stuff in
there is just me making like

636
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,302
these

637
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:29,605
minor tweaks or seriously
messing things up. Oh, how do

638
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,907
you want to

639
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:34,877
do that? Because I also didn't
know that you could take back to

640
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:40,038
meds. You can change things. It
was a, it was a wild time, I

641
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:40,607
think back then.

642
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:45,333
Jono: Yeah, I still make those
kinds of commits. Like I made a

643
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,972
bunch of commits where I'm just
like removing a trailing slash

644
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,542
just to see if like my HTML tag
is working properly. I'm like,

645
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,002
okay, well this isn't working, I
have no idea what I'm doing.

646
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,482
Dan: Yeah. That's all right.
That's what like squash merges

647
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:00,217
before, right. Just hide all
that stuff. Yeah, no, I was, um,

648
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,952
I was

649
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:08,593
working on the, um, um, get up
our, uh, I mean, I'm sorry, our

650
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:13,782
co-working sort of room, um, and
involves, uh, like a slack app

651
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:19,063
and a zoom app and Netlify
functions, um, up until a point

652
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:21,792
you can kind of point it to
local your local stuff. Um, but

653
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,547
eventually you have to like
point it to a server that you

654
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,181
have to

655
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:28,587
point the, the zoom app or the
Slack App, to a server. And that

656
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:30,837
was incredibly hard to test. I
was, I ended up doing. the same

657
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:32,232
thing. I was just like, I was
sending stuff up and have it,

658
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,627
you

659
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:36,928
know, deploy and then see if it
works. Um, I have A I have a

660
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,837
slack, like a test slack
workspace, you know, that's just

661
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,507
like, Dan's whatever test Slack
and, uh, there's like 4,000

662
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,177
Dan's

663
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:49,498
in there. Cause I was testing a
new, you know, like what happens

664
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:53,248
when a member joins, you know?
And um, if I didn't get it right

665
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,163
then I had. Make the change,
commit it, let it build and then

666
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,133
join again, you know, with the
new account and see if it works.

667
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,552
It's like the matrix with Agent
Smith is like, uh, it's just

668
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,021
like

669
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:09,373
a slack that's just full of a
thousand mes. Don't go there.

670
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:14,052
It's frightening. I'll say I'll
send you an invite. You uh,

671
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:18,731
yeah.

672
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:19,752
Oh

673
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,257
Bekah: So you also talked about,
um, doing videos. And so I

674
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,597
wonder

675
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,847
like one does, can you digital
garden videos? Is that a thing?

676
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,468
Is that like Instagram live? I
don't know.

677
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:34,258
Jono: Maybe.

678
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:37,048
Bekah: how does that like play
into this role of content

679
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:37,407
creation?

680
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:44,417
Jono: Yeah. Oh man. Interesting.
I, I would say digitally

681
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:49,407
gardening videos is harder. Then
writing because you have to do a

682
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,617
lot more editing in the video.
Um, you can't really just cut a

683
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:53,967
piece out and then like add a
new piece in it. Wouldn't like

684
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,317
tend

685
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,448
to make sense or missed, um,

686
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,137
Dan: Have you tried, have you
tried, uh, have you

687
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,968
tried,Descript yet for video
editing

688
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:05,367
Jono: I haven't. No, I've been
sticking with a

689
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:09,377
Dan: you can literally copy and
paste like text and it'll do the

690
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,867
video and the audio and
everything like really well. I'm

691
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,448
sorry. They don't, they don't
sponsor us or anything. I just,

692
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,458
I've just been excited about it

693
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,178
Jono: wondering. Yeah.

694
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,057
Dan: Sorry, I didn't mean to,
um, while I did, I guess I did

695
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,797
mean

696
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:23,067
to interrupt, but, uh, I didn't
want,

697
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:23,188
Bekah: Okay.

698
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,107
Dan: I didn't, I don't know why
I said, I don't know why like

699
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:28,847
interrupt on purpose and then
say, sorry, I didn't mean to

700
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,577
interrupt. Uh, anyway, um,

701
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:35,712
Jono: okay. No. You're good.
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I think

702
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:38,323
that's a really, there's so many
tools out there, which is great.

703
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:39,552
And like, I think Bekah
mentioned live streaming as

704
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:40,721
well, which I

705
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,732
guess like you can kind of pick
and choose Nicky T is doing a

706
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,462
really great job with live
streaming and he's kind of like

707
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:49,012
rolling with the punches and
learning Rust, which I think is

708
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:51,607
really cool. Um, I do think like
where, where I see video,

709
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,202
because

710
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,242
it is completely different
platform. It's kind of like

711
00:32:56,272 --> 00:33:01,597
YouTube, so that. You can't
really curate YouTube videos as

712
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,357
easily. It's like that they own
that platform. So they tend to

713
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,277
show it how they want to show
it. Um, so it is a little bit

714
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,197
harder

715
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:08,917
in that sense,

716
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,212
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And I think
with YouTube, you can't change

717
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:11,382
them

718
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:12,343
either. Right? I mean, if you
change them and then, then it's

719
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:13,303
a

720
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:15,252
new, you have to create a new
video and delete the old on or

721
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,201
so

722
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:17,833
you know, something like

723
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,817
Jono: right? Yeah. Although
yeah, exactly.

724
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:22,313
Dan: yeah.

725
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,587
Bekah: Create new ones.

726
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:24,593
Dan: That's interesting though.

727
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:25,528
Jono: Yeah.

728
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:29,387
Bekah: Now we're going to invent
digital gardening for videos

729
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:31,073
Jono: That would be cool.

730
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:40,508
Bekah: or it wouldn't at all.
So, okay. So you're doing these

731
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:44,347
videos and is this just kind of
along the same lines as what

732
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:48,458
you're doing with your digital
garden, your. Working on these

733
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,213
things, learning them, and then
just providing another avenue

734
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,968
for

735
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,738
people to kind of learn along
with you.

736
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:57,837
Jono: yeah, I think like, yeah,
exactly that, and it was also a

737
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,337
challenge for me, cause I'd
never really done video stuff as

738
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,837
well.

739
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,597
So at the start of the year, I
really wanted to kind of explore

740
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:07,942
it a little bit more. Um, and
then. Um, I kinda, uh, realized

741
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,822
that I really enjoy doing it. I
don't enjoy actually filming the

742
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,052
videos. It's really hard, or I
can't speak in front of a

743
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,282
camera.

744
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:16,552
Like, I don't know how people do
it. Um, but the whole process of

745
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:17,917
like editing and like getting
all the music and all that stuff

746
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,282
is,

747
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,077
is really fun. Um, so yeah,
it's, it's been a goal and a lot

748
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,562
of the

749
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,902
content is pretty similar to
what I would put in. The blog,

750
00:34:26,902 --> 00:34:29,241
but it

751
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:33,413
does go through more in-depth
tutorials because I hate writing

752
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,782
about tutorials, but I think
showing is just a lot easier to

753
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,822
follow and a lot easier to
explain in my mind,

754
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:41,588
Dan: Yeah, that's, that's pretty
cool. and so you can I suppose,

755
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,628
yeah, you don't have to like
create all the screenshots or

756
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,623
the, uh, you know, grab the code
examples perfectly if you're

757
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:47,618
just

758
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,719
showing, you know, when you're
doing like a screen-share and

759
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,458
showing the, um, the app like in
place, right. Just take somebody

760
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,838
for a tour. I can totally see. I
can totally see how that it,

761
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,218
that

762
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:57,518
would be.

763
00:34:57,673 --> 00:35:01,264
Jono: Yeah, and you can go on
like tangents and you can get

764
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,844
lost a little bit, and it's all
easy to come back to the main

765
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:06,463
thread. Then it isn't like a
blog, like you can't just write

766
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,418
like an extra thousand words on
a tangent and then expect them

767
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,353
to

768
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,034
like keep reading after that.
Okay.

769
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:14,838
Dan: You could, but, uh,

770
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,843
Bekah: I think I just, uh, wait,
I have to go back and delete

771
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,777
some

772
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:19,409
of my blog posts.

773
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,798
Dan: um, have you been doing,
I'm sorry if I might have

774
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:25,357
already

775
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:26,558
answered this, have you been
doing much streaming as well?

776
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,758
Um,

777
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:29,798
aside from the produced months,
have you dug into that?

778
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:35,043
Jono: no, I haven't. Um, I've
been thinking about it. I don't,

779
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:41,704
uh, we come back to Nick. Um, I
can't speak and like learn or

780
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:45,333
like do something at the same
time. So it really just be like,

781
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:46,953
it would just be silence. He
used to be watching me on my

782
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:48,542
computer.

783
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,824
It's a skill. I don't know how
you do that.

784
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:53,623
Dan: Yeah, no, it is. I've been,
I've been have been wondering

785
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:54,688
about that. too. I've been
thinking about, you know,

786
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:55,753
digging

787
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,988
a little bit, and this is paying
attention to myself. Coding,

788
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:00,223
not,

789
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,288
I wasn't streaming, you know,
but I was just like, oh, I

790
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:02,352
haven't

791
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:06,583
like talked to moved for like
three hours. Like this is not

792
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,724
going to be fun for anybody.

793
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:10,244
Bekah: I think, I think one of
the things that's about it is

794
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:12,914
it's nice if you can do with a
partner, because then they can

795
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:16,693
kind of fill in, like, Nick does
it with Christina and Seth and I

796
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:20,954
are going to be doing it in a
couple of weeks. Um, and the

797
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:23,143
first time Seth and I did it, it
was like I had not ever

798
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:26,353
live-streamed and I'm, I'm
terrified of it. Like it's not

799
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,513
something that I feel
comfortable doing and

800
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:30,673
immediately I froze up.

801
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:32,045
And Seth was right there, kind
of like talking through it,

802
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,417
like,

803
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:35,018
okay, well, this is what we're
going to do. And this is where

804
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,188
I'm like, okay, now I feel
comfortable and I can kind of go

805
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:41,458
along with it. And so to be able
to have that conversation, I

806
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,608
think makes it a little bit
easier because then you have way

807
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:47,059
less pressure on yourself to be
doing all of this.

808
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:51,934
Jono: 100%. That that makes a
lot of sense.

809
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,184
Dan: Yeah. I've, I've enjoyed
times when we just jump on a

810
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:55,789
zoom

811
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,734
or whatever, and, and people,
you know, like,if somebody posts

812
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,679
in

813
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,709
help and pairing or something.
It has a problem. Right. And

814
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:01,739
pairing

815
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,688
up, like doing the pair
programming and just sort of

816
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,989
recording it. I think that's,
you're talking about Bekah and

817
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:10,278
like, it's easier for me to ask
questions or to answer questions

818
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:12,093
then to like on a, don't think
of all possible questions and

819
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:13,877
then

820
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:17,358
produce content, you know, like
that, the, uh, the thought

821
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,768
process for me. Um, it's like,
um, I don't know, you know, you

822
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:22,758
just like answer what's in front
of you. Right. And then, and

823
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:23,748
then

824
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:29,514
just talk, but the, I feel like
when you're streaming, it's. Um,

825
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:31,943
the expectation is maybe it's a
little more okay. If you make a

826
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:35,873
mistake or if you, you know, um,
start saying something and then

827
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:36,833
you're like, oh, wait a minute.
I just remembered this other

828
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,793
thing.

829
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:42,204
Or, you know, something like
that. Um, a little more, like, I

830
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:45,869
don't know if it's a little more
into that. The it's okay to make

831
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,539
mistakes mindsets, right. It's
like not perfect mindset is the

832
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,619
streaming. Um, which I try to
remember to when I, when I

833
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,259
consider it and right, is, um,
it's like the work in progress

834
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:58,228
kind of thing. Um, I could see
how it could all fit, fit, fit

835
00:37:58,228 --> 00:37:58,889
together, you know?

836
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,664
Jono: Yeah, I think that's the
beauty of live streaming as well

837
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:06,253
as the fact that you can kind of
make these mistakes and like let

838
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:09,614
other people see how you kind of
move on from there. Um, I think

839
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:13,333
with videos, um, I'm actually
trying to do a video where I'm

840
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,908
trying to show that process a
bit more. Um, but with videos it

841
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:16,483
is

842
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:17,114
very edited.

843
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:17,713
Dan: Right,

844
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,003
Jono: Um, so you don't see that.

845
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:23,224
Dan: right. Well, yes. If you
went onto YouTube and push play

846
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:24,663
on somebody's video, you
wouldn't want to see them

847
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,102
saying, um, you

848
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,554
know, I'm not really sure how to
do this, but like watching the

849
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,713
thought process in a stream, the
expectations a little bit, like

850
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:33,153
you go into a stream knowing
that it's live right. And

851
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:34,593
knowing

852
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:35,971
that. Probably going to be doing
that sort of thing. You know

853
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,348
what

854
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,449
I mean? Figuring it out in front
of you. And that's part of the,

855
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,998
part of the draw, I suppose. I
mean, definitely part of the

856
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:45,809
draw, but, um, a little bit
different mindset, I suppose,

857
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,246
when you're creating, you know,
as a creator. Right. Are you

858
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:52,626
going to add your videos to your
site, to the, to the digital

859
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,516
garden. Um, and in some way

860
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:59,655
Jono: Yeah. I, um, I had a, like
a fleeting thought about adding

861
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:02,395
like the most recent video. Um,
I think like, ultimately I'd

862
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:05,135
love

863
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,398
to create like a, a platform
where I can add tutorials like

864
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:09,661
my

865
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,476
own course platform kind of
thing, then have everything

866
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,291
just,

867
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,570
you know, work in one place,

868
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,311
Dan: Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. So
you have like a collection of,

869
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,650
uh, yeah. Step one, step two,
step three kind of thing. Yeah.

870
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,291
Jono: Yeah.

871
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,595
Dan: Um, that, well, I mean,
there's, I mean, I could, I

872
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,310
could

873
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,605
see that being fitting pretty
well into the digital garden.

874
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:28,890
You

875
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:32,190
know, I idea I could also see
it, you know, there's lots of

876
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,121
obviously lots of different, uh,
approaches to that, to that, um,

877
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,280
that that people have done. So
that's pretty cool.

878
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,155
Bekah: So for these, it seems
like you have a lot of you're

879
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,916
working on a lot of things that
you are learning about

880
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:48,990
personally. Um, and then when
you are, are working in your day

881
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,035
job,

882
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:54,690
you're working with rails,
right? And so how do you just

883
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,315
kind of

884
00:39:57,315 --> 00:40:01,876
like make that jump back and
forth or, you know, are there

885
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:03,571
things that you're learning from
what you're learning that you

886
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,266
can

887
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,186
apply to your day job?

888
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,560
Jono: Yeah. I think like both of
that is like totally valid

889
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,180
point.

890
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,740
It's like jumping back and forth
between functional to like

891
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,299
object

892
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:21,860
paradigm is, is really hard
sometimes. Um, I'm not very good

893
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,771
at functional language, I guess
that helps, you know, like I

894
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,740
gotta have those like muscle
memory, um, yet. Um, but yeah,

895
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,225
there's definitely things you
can learn from all these

896
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:30,710
different

897
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:37,170
sources that, um, You can bring
into any new project, um, had

898
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,271
there a quote somewhere where
it's like, you never starting

899
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,670
anything from scratch. Like you
always taking those past

900
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,305
experiences with you. And I
think that's very true. Um,

901
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:44,940
whenever

902
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,750
I'm learning any of these new
things, is that from Vic as

903
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,560
well?

904
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,436
Bekah: I was going to say,

905
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,541
Jono: I'm like, gosh,

906
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,056
Bekah: I remember Vic talking
about that.

907
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:55,465
Dan: Yep. And we talked about
that with Sara, a bunch too, on,

908
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:57,120
on when, when she came on the
pod is, you know, I mean, she

909
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,775
came

910
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,680
from, you know, the agriculture
tech field and, uh, you know,

911
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,585
was

912
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:06,606
able to apply a lot of that, Um,
to her current. yeah. It's moved

913
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:11,226
from that to, well, FinTech, I
guess. But, um, I do like that

914
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:15,706
idea. We've talked about it
before, you know, it's that idea

915
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,115
of leaning on your past
experiences, you know, and how

916
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:18,524
it

917
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:20,685
can all be relevant, um,
relevant to you or to your

918
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,845
current, um,

919
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,726
platform. It's funny thinking
about that switch in between,

920
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,035
like when you're learning a new
paradigm sort of, and you have

921
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:29,444
an

922
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,195
old one, it's like that balance
point of when your muscle memory

923
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:36,166
tips over and you start actually
like reaching for functional

924
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,315
things when you're in back in
Ruby or, you know, uh, vice

925
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:44,311
versa. Um, When you're so when
you're learning, um, so this is,

926
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,990
uh, wait, I'm sorry. Oh, Elixir.
Right. Um, so you're learning

927
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,460
elixir. Do you find yourself
doing things like, um, how do I

928
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,971
do some Ruby thing in elixir
like that kind of Google, Google

929
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:59,340
search, a thought process, or,
or do you try to, um, sort of

930
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,709
erase

931
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,871
your mind for, for, for the
moment, you know, when you're

932
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:07,471
trying to learn a new thing, uh,
and, and do the, you know, pure

933
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,661
like elixir way or whatever, if
that exists.

934
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:15,360
Jono: Yeah. Um, Definitely have
a bad habit of like, how do I do

935
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,681
Ruby in X? Um, cause I'm just so
used to Ruby and Ruby and rails

936
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:21,960
and stuff. Um, but I think
they're getting into the weeds

937
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,239
of

938
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,485
the language is really
important. So like I'm trying to

939
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:26,730
like switch

940
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,126
our mindset to like, be more of
like, okay, how do I do this in

941
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:29,521
a

942
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,521
functional language rather than
how do I do it in Ruby and then

943
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,331
transport it over.

944
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,110
Dan: Yeah.

945
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:36,435
Jono: Um, yeah, and I, and I
know like in the Elixir slack,

946
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:38,535
people

947
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:39,990
talk about it a little bit,
where you run into a lot of

948
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,444
issues when

949
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,175
you try and just like port over
Ruby, into Elixir, like a lot of

950
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,715
things just don't make sense and
don't work. Like anti-patterns

951
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:48,135
almost

952
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,610
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That's
interesting. Have you, uh, has

953
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,750
there been any like specific
things that you can think of

954
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,890
that

955
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:58,550
like you approaches you can take
when like back into the Ruby

956
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,811
world from, from the new stuff?

957
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:03,061
Jono: Yeah. Um, great question.
I think the biggest thing is

958
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,981
really

959
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:08,371
just the immutability aspect of
it. So like, you know, making

960
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:13,501
sure, like I am being really
explicit with what is changing

961
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:17,010
under the hood in Ruby has
really helped. And the Elixir

962
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,750
concurrency model is, um, I
would say like is built a little

963
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,470
bit

964
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:25,501
differently than how Rudy's
concurrency model work. So it's

965
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:27,420
all about passing messages and
not about changing the data

966
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,339
that.

967
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:31,530
Threads share. So kind of taking
that functionality into review

968
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,345
as

969
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:36,315
well. Um, at least on an
architectural level has really

970
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:36,525
helped.

971
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,585
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

972
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,876
Bekah: You are, you also
mentioned you had done some iOS

973
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:44,376
development early on,

974
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:44,916
Jono: yes. Yeah.

975
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,771
Bekah: have you, how has that,
okay, so you've done it. So you

976
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:57,510
did iOS and then Ruby, and now
you're learning Elixir. So is

977
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,561
there like a pattern that you've
seen that you've worked through

978
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:03,781
those changes or as you've grown
or things that you've learned

979
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:06,001
and

980
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:09,331
can apply as you learn the new
things?

981
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:13,308
Jono: Yeah. Um, well, I. Have
not touched iOS since late 2015.

982
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:16,410
And

983
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:18,226
that was like on the cusp of
like Objective C switching over

984
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:20,041
to

985
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,591
Swift. So I didn't even know
what the new IRS languages, um,

986
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:25,141
so I

987
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:26,851
think like I remember early on
the way I learned was really

988
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:28,561
just

989
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:30,541
about repetition. So it was
like, how many times can I run

990
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,521
rails

991
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:34,305
new and just like, understand
how all of that works. And then

992
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,089
I

993
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,815
remember having just so many
rails new projects with just

994
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:39,540
like

995
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,335
one model in there just to kind
of. Well, because I just never

996
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:45,496
finished some projects, but also
I felt like it helped build that

997
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:48,735
muscle memory of like what a
model looks like, where it goes,

998
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:53,356
how will this fits in? And now
I've started thinking about how

999
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:56,775
can I like shorts. I taught that
because it takes a really long

1000
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:59,985
time. You just doing a lot of
repetition. Um, so really

1001
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:02,956
thinking about how the pieces
fit together and making those

1002
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:06,106
analogies from like previous
experiences. Um, like with

1003
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,363
Elixir, obviously Ruby doesn't
always fit, but I, how. How

1004
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:10,620
would

1005
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,831
this look in object oriented and
what the differences are, has

1006
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,731
really helped. Um, and then
finding the naming of things has

1007
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,880
been really useful, both with
like onboarding, um, a new job,

1008
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,251
just understanding what the
definitions are, and then also

1009
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:26,101
with like learning languages,
because there's things you can

1010
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,371
there's things I want to Google,
but cause I don't know the name

1011
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,990
of the thing I'll be like, okay.
So question mark.in JavaScript,

1012
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,221
like, which is that.

1013
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:38,821
Dan: Um, yes, that syntax,
especially so hard to Google

1014
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:40,876
for.

1015
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:45,106
Um, wait, is that, see, now I
can't even remember. Is that the

1016
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:49,635
newest one or is that. the, this
is every time I, I, I, I, uh,

1017
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:54,916
Yes, learning new languages is
hard learning old, keeping up to

1018
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,445
date with, um, you know,
languages that you've been

1019
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:59,956
writing in for a long time. It
turns out also hard sometimes.

1020
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,951
Jono: Just

1021
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,615
Dan: Right? Learning, learning
is hard, but Yeah. that idea of,

1022
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:05,595
um,

1023
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:13,815
like learning the, the Google
language for language, um, it's,

1024
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,396
I feel like a very interesting
concept and something that, um,

1025
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:22,050
it's something that sort of. Uh,
the, the way that people who are

1026
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,030
experienced with a language or a
concept, um, the way that they

1027
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,280
Google for things is different
right. Than, than the way it's

1028
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,050
somebody who's, who's learning
from scratch, you know, for

1029
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,580
learning for the first time
does. And, um, I feel like

1030
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,110
that's one

1031
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,135
of the things that is cool. Um,
Show in like pairing or, or, um,

1032
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:41,956
streaming, uh, is those Google
searches, you know, what are the

1033
00:46:41,956 --> 00:46:45,195
kinds of things I searched for?
Cause I, you know, in JavaScript

1034
00:46:45,255 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm like a pretty effective
Googler, you know what I mean?

1035
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:53,405
And it's not, um, and I've done
this where, uh, I have in slack,

1036
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,195
you know, if somebody is asking
for help, you know, and I've

1037
00:46:56,195 --> 00:46:59,610
tried to. Um, well, you know, I
find the answer pretty quickly.

1038
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:01,531
Um, and then I'm like, here is
what I searched for to like,

1039
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,331
find

1040
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:04,276
that, I don't know. I never know
if that's helped like that.

1041
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,221
It's,

1042
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,791
it's probably not that, I mean,
seeing the process is probably

1043
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,561
kind of helpful. I don't think
you can just like teach yourself

1044
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,221
how to Google and JavaScript
before you, before you know it,

1045
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,130
you know, I think it just comes
along with learning, but, um, it

1046
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,141
is a, it is an interesting thing
that I don't think you think

1047
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:22,170
about, um, often when you're,
when you're in the middle of it

1048
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,916
or when you're trying to. You
know, trying to help somebody

1049
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:29,505
learn, you know, things like
that. It's, uh, the, I wonder if

1050
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:31,305
there's a phrase for that
because the Google language is

1051
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,105
not that

1052
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:35,115
doesn't like this, right. Not
very clear, but,

1053
00:47:36,065 --> 00:47:37,286
Jono: like how to Google that

1054
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,106
Dan: how to Google and
JavaScript, you know, like,

1055
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:39,635
Jono: Yeah.

1056
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,606
Dan: um, but it is, uh, um,

1057
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:44,135
Jono: Yeah.

1058
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,425
Dan: I don't know. It is cool
that you mentioned that cause

1059
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:50,235
it's a, you know, it is like an
important piece of of learning I

1060
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:54,365
think is. Is finding out how to
find things out.

1061
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,686
Jono: yeah. And it's, it's hard
to think about that sometimes as

1062
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,175
well, because once you've done
it, a bunch of times, it becomes

1063
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:03,200
almost like you just do it. It's
like a thing you're even

1064
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,895
thinking

1065
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:06,920
about. Um, but yeah. And then
trying to explain that to

1066
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,944
someone

1067
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:11,615
who's just starting, it's like,
there's a bit of a disconnect

1068
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,956
that sometimes, um, it can be
really hard to explain.

1069
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:15,980
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And
you know, when you're coming

1070
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,674
from

1071
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:22,231
a place where you. You know,
pretty experienced with some

1072
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:24,061
language, right? I, uh, you
know, I feel like it makes

1073
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:25,891
learning new

1074
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:27,811
languages a little easier
because you have some, there is

1075
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,731
like some

1076
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,581
shared vocabulary across pretty
much all programming languages.

1077
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:37,291
And so if you can remember some
of them, uh, the, you know, the

1078
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,681
syntax will be different, but
the, the concepts, lots of times

1079
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:42,345
will be the same, but you know,
like string string

1080
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:44,009
interpretation

1081
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:47,356
for, for instance, is, is a
thing. You know, what that means

1082
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:48,991
in JavaScript is basically you
have one string and you can

1083
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:50,626
stick

1084
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:53,476
variables inside of it. Um, I
mean, that's what it means

1085
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:54,631
everywhere. Right? And
JavaScript does it one way and

1086
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,786
other

1087
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:57,496
languages do a different way.
But if you Google, you know,

1088
00:48:57,496 --> 00:48:59,206
string

1089
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:02,295
interpolation, elixir, you'll
probably find the answer right

1090
00:49:02,295 --> 00:49:04,783
away. And if you. But if you
can't remember that phrase,

1091
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:07,271
which

1092
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,391
is what happens to me a lot, you
know, then it's like, Okay. uh,

1093
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,451
put two strings together with
variable, you know, it looks

1094
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,340
there or whatever, and that
Google search will not be as

1095
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,490
good, you know? And it's it's
an, I mean, this happens to me

1096
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,940
because these phrases, as you've
seen during this, uh, pocket's

1097
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,260
recording these phrases,
disappear from my brain, um,

1098
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,580
very

1099
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:28,090
quickly, uh, you know, and then
they come back, but. And it's

1100
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,260
it's um, it's another thing
that's hard. I feel hard to when

1101
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,340
you're learning, especially as a
beginner, um, that you don't

1102
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,740
think about it as, you know,
like you have a power as an

1103
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,231
experienced developer that you,
you know, you probably don't

1104
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:41,681
realize.

1105
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,221
Jono: Yeah. And it also Oak
place. Good.

1106
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,016
Bekah: I was going to say, this
goes back to your point about

1107
00:49:48,016 --> 00:49:49,696
communication and you know,
you're writing and that's part

1108
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,376
of

1109
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:52,785
communication and learning how
to do that. But like even

1110
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:54,194
Googling

1111
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:58,186
is part of communicating, um,
being able to speak into the

1112
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:01,786
world, what you need or what you
want. Right. And so sometimes.

1113
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:06,155
It's easier just to go to a
group of people. Or I know like

1114
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:08,105
yesterday I was working on how
do I get a slack reminder to

1115
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,055
this

1116
00:50:10,056 --> 00:50:12,425
channel every single day? And
I'm like, well, I know Marie did

1117
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,015
that. So I'm just going to ask
her first because it's late and

1118
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:15,605
I

1119
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:18,545
need to get right to the source.
And I know that she can point me

1120
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:19,775
in the right direction. And she
did, she was like, this is what

1121
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,005
I

1122
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:24,726
look for. And it took me right
to where I needed to be. And so

1123
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:27,333
sometimes, you know, knowing who
to ask the questions to. That

1124
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,940
can

1125
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,561
help you understand how to ask
them. The next time is a really

1126
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:36,541
good step in communication and
in learning or, you know,

1127
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,521
writing

1128
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:40,216
whatever. But all of these
things are ultimately skills

1129
00:50:40,216 --> 00:50:41,911
that we all

1130
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:42,541
need to be using.

1131
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,101
Jono: yeah. Asking for help is
so hard as well. When you're

1132
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:47,661
first

1133
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:50,630
starting. I remember I did not
ask enough questions when I was

1134
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,931
signed to learn Ruby on Rails.
And I felt like there was almost

1135
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:55,536
this like stigma of like, it
felt bad to ask questions. Like

1136
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:57,141
I had

1137
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,030
to struggle with Google for a
bit before I did. Um, and yeah,

1138
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,919
it

1139
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,351
just, it's a terrible way to
learn. Like, just ask someone.

1140
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:04,976
Dan: Yeah,

1141
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:08,911
Bekah: it is really hard. Well,
and you went to university, so

1142
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,860
you had the traditional English
classroom experience. And so I'm

1143
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,920
curious, cause I'm a bootcamp
grad and I learned by myself. So

1144
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,101
I don't, I didn't really have
that experience of people asking

1145
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:25,380
questions around me. Did, did
that happen there? Maybe I'm

1146
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,960
imagining in my head what, what
I think it would be.

1147
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:32,780
Jono: Yeah. Uh, yeah, I mean,
people definitely ask questions

1148
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,806
and those plenty of people that
are just like, Very, I guess,

1149
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:40,036
questions with answers that just
went out of my head. Um, so

1150
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:44,746
there's definitely a lot of
courses in uni that I have not

1151
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:50,686
found that useful in real life.
Um, so yeah, it's both. It is

1152
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:53,835
like, I guess it is time of told
him that, that, um, ability to

1153
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:55,275
ask the right question.

1154
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:59,365
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, I guess, I
mean, it's very different being

1155
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:02,655
a, being in a university where
you're expected to ask questions

1156
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,976
versus like in a job, it seems
like the stakes are a little bit

1157
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:08,835
steeper or something. You know,
I know that a lot of bootcamp

1158
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,694
grads

1159
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:13,096
are like, yeah, I'm done with
bootcamp. Like finally, this is,

1160
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:15,865
I can breathe in like No.

1161
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:17,731
Jono: Please. Did you ask all
the questions?

1162
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,641
Bekah: No. I mean, I didn't have
the opportunity to ask a lot of

1163
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:25,811
questions, um, because it was a
self paced thing and there were

1164
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,070
some opportunities for meeting
with people, but there weren't

1165
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:34,090
that many, and I just didn't
really know about expectations.

1166
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,385
Like, should I be working with
others, students on things? And

1167
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:38,680
I

1168
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:41,351
don't know, as a mom of four
kids. So some people would be

1169
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:43,530
like, yeah, we're getting
together for five hours. Come.

1170
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:50,070
No, I can't do that. Or that's
late and I wake up early because

1171
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:54,931
I've got kids. So I just never
really kind of found, I think

1172
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:58,710
maybe the group of people I
could have learned from in that

1173
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:04,141
situation. Um, but I mean, we, I
talk about this all the time.

1174
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:07,621
I've gotten a lot better with
communicating. I don't usually

1175
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:11,701
spend. Many hours on the same
problem without asking a

1176
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:15,661
question. And if I do, it's only
because of my stubbornness, like

1177
00:53:15,661 --> 00:53:19,530
I know I can get this, you know,
so that's, that's more of a me

1178
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,581
problem, I think.

1179
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,201
Dan: Okay.

1180
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,371
Jono: Um, I think like you also
touched on a really great point

1181
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,540
where it's like, you didn't
couldn't find the right people.

1182
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,709
I

1183
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,260
think finding a community,
especially when you're like just

1184
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,231
starting out that really made a
lot of difference. Um, in my

1185
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:35,731
learning journey was finding
like the code VB community and

1186
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:37,231
then

1187
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:38,400
getting a bit more involved with
like Ruby meetups and stuff,

1188
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,569
just

1189
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,880
so I can have the people around
me to actually also ask

1190
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,331
questions.

1191
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:46,406
Bekah: Yeah, and I love the Ruby
community. I really thought

1192
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:48,251
after

1193
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:51,041
boot camp, we did Ruby and rails
and I thought, well, that's what

1194
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,216
I'm going to get a job in
because everybody was so nice.

1195
00:53:53,216 --> 00:53:55,391
And I

1196
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,671
liked it and I understood it and
JavaScript and react. I was

1197
00:53:57,671 --> 00:53:59,891
like,

1198
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:04,931
oh, this is awful. Um, and, and
here we are.

1199
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,155
Dan: Yeah, JavaScript is
awesome.

1200
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:14,331
Jono: here's a thing.

1201
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:15,681
Bekah: it,

1202
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:21,295
Dan: I feel it, JavaScript fits
my, you know, my way of doing

1203
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:25,681
things, which is. Which is, you
know, out whatever.

1204
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:31,050
Bekah: I mean, I really enjoy it
now. I like to be able to.

1205
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:34,815
Problem solving the ways that
I'm doing and think about things

1206
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:38,476
differently. It just, I think a
lot of it was, it just took me

1207
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,536
time to understand all of the
things that we're talking about,

1208
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,710
like how to communicate it and
how to understand it. And I

1209
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,884
don't

1210
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:49,815
know, people just seem less
friendly and JavaScript.

1211
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:52,520
Jono: I think there's just a lot
more JavaScript developers and

1212
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,839
no

1213
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,090
knocking javascript, javascript
is a great language to use

1214
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,500
everywhere. Um, but yeah,
there's just a lot of people

1215
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,910
using it. So

1216
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:01,670
you get a much wider range of
characters.

1217
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:04,476
Dan: Yeah. And I think, uh, the
full stack nature of JavaScript.

1218
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,666
So you can write in, you know,
Node and you can write in

1219
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:09,965
whatever browser, you know, or
react to it. Everything is like

1220
00:55:10,865 --> 00:55:12,200
you say, you write JavaScript
and that doesn't even mean

1221
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,535
anything

1222
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:16,326
anymore. I mean, it means it
doesn't really tell you a lot of

1223
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,666
information about what they're
actually doing. Whereas, you

1224
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,335
know, if somebody is doing
rails. I can imagine pretty much

1225
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:22,004
what

1226
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:23,925
they're doing, you know, uh,
like from on a day to day, you

1227
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:25,845
know,

1228
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,525
uh, basis, you know what I mean?
It's like, if somebody says, oh,

1229
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:32,596
I write Node, you know, okay,
that's cool. Like that means

1230
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,326
you're doing some backend stuff.
Um, but maybe just, you know,

1231
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:38,085
there's all those people are
writing in JavaScript as well,

1232
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,976
you know? And all of the people
are writing reacts and all the

1233
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:43,876
people writing Vue and just
writing vanilla JavaScript on,

1234
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:49,456
you know, on simple webpages,
uh, In the same pool of people.

1235
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:53,416
Right. So, um, and Java
JavaScript doesn't have like,

1236
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:57,376
well, I don't know. The, you
know, Ruby started with at

1237
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:59,356
least,

1238
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,175
uh, or rails started with, you
know, that the, this sort of

1239
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,996
community lead around rails, um,
that built up as well. I know

1240
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:06,601
they had some struggles
recently, but, um, I feel like

1241
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:08,206
that's, I

1242
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:12,016
feel like, honestly, that's part
of the, um, and I'm not deep in

1243
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:13,111
the Ruby community, so you can
correct me if I'm wrong, but I

1244
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:14,206
do

1245
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:19,215
feel like that was part of the
community. They. Back in, um,

1246
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,485
when was that? 15 years ago or
something like that, uh, around

1247
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:23,985
rails, you know, cause that's
when that's when I started

1248
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,525
hearing about Ruby was when
rails, you know, um, got going

1249
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:30,615
and, um, a lot of people just
kind of excited about the same

1250
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:32,266
thing all at once, you know, in
a positive way.

1251
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,735
Jono: yeah, a hundred percent.
Yeah. I mean, Yeah. Obviously

1252
00:56:36,735 --> 00:56:38,430
there's definitely some topics
to be discussed around rails and

1253
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,125
the

1254
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:43,306
community. But I think like a
lot of that started to, because

1255
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:47,416
everyone wanted something better
than PHB. And I think it was

1256
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,146
really groundbreaking at the
time. Um, and it still is like

1257
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:52,096
everyone, there's still big
companies like Shopify. So you

1258
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:57,045
still use as rails. Um, so yeah,
there's, I think a lot of people

1259
00:56:57,045 --> 00:57:00,315
kind of wanted that change,
especially from the Ruby

1260
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:00,795
community.

1261
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:03,966
Bekah: So I going to back up
maybe a little bit, just a

1262
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:05,481
second

1263
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:10,070
too. So we talked about, you
know, you're doing rails and

1264
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:15,016
there's an expectation maybe of
what that looks like, but. Can

1265
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:16,516
you walk us through what that
does look like, like

1266
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,016
practically,

1267
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:23,085
like what are you doing at work?
What does your day-to-day look.

1268
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:28,501
Jono: Yeah. So I think the
day-to-day really is around. Um,

1269
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:31,065
I think it's pretty similar to
most other jobs where you take

1270
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:32,279
an

1271
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,291
issue and you, you pick it up.
And, um, a lot of the rail stuff

1272
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:41,521
is really just about connecting
with all our different, um,

1273
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:45,331
Components. So we have kind of
this rails engine type

1274
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:47,101
architecture. So just making
sure that and rails engine is

1275
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:48,751
really

1276
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:50,880
just like a library that you can
just like plug into your

1277
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,751
application. Um, so making sure
those connections work, um, and

1278
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:59,101
then using, we use graph QL a
lot Shopify. So I'm just like

1279
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,010
learning about that aspect too,
and how everything kind of fits

1280
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,260
together. I'm not sure if I
answered the question though,

1281
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,665
Bekah: Um, I think that's,
that's a good way to think about

1282
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:09,780
how,

1283
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:17,356
how you're approaching your day
to day and what's going on. So I

1284
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:19,785
feel like I don't want to leave
this podcast without giving you

1285
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:22,214
a

1286
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:25,606
huge shout out for sending me
Tim Tams,

1287
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,351
Jono: You're welcome.

1288
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:35,746
Bekah: changing experience. So
can you explain to everyone what

1289
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:36,916
a Tim Tam is?

1290
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,176
Jono: sure I can. They are an
Australian chocolate biscuit

1291
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:42,561
that

1292
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,920
is covered in chocolate. And the
two layers of the biscuit also

1293
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,541
has chocolate in between the two
layers. Um, so it's pretty

1294
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,391
amazing. And there's different
flavors in Australia where you

1295
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:57,650
can get different stuffings in
the middle. Um, you get double

1296
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,181
coat. I think I sent you a
double coat

1297
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:00,025
Bekah: did send me a double.
Okay.

1298
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:03,286
Jono: Yeah. Okay. Which is like,
Just a thick layer of chocolate.

1299
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:07,155
It's yeah. It's, uh, it's been
really good. I've been rationing

1300
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:09,885
them out as well. We've like,
we're almost out

1301
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,370
Bekah: Which I should have
ration them out. I will not tell

1302
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,530
you how

1303
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,871
many of them I ate for breakfast
every

1304
00:59:17,106 --> 00:59:17,525
Jono: Yeah.

1305
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,750
Bekah: Okay. So do you prefer
the double dip tip and Tams or

1306
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,370
the

1307
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:22,121
single

1308
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:25,835
Jono: the double K for sure um,
but

1309
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:27,280
Bekah: enjoyed the single here.

1310
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:32,010
Jono: Ooh, interesting. I just
love the more chocolate to swing

1311
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,490
one chocolate. Um, sorry, Dan.
I'll just send you something

1312
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:35,751
Dan: Yeah, no, I'm just, uh,

1313
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:37,175
Bekah: missing

1314
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,990
Dan: Tim, Tim Tam -less over
here.

1315
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:42,615
Bekah: glad there are not Tim
Tams and Kroger because

1316
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,431
Dan: sounds dangerous.

1317
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:44,925
Bekah: they are very dangerous.

1318
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,530
Jono: it was so easy and it's
not that many in a pack.

1319
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:50,516
Dan: Yeah.

1320
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:52,130
Bekah: there were not enough

1321
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:53,710
Jono: Yeah.

1322
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,940
Bekah: simultaneously asleep too
much. Do you now, do you eat

1323
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,040
your

1324
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:02,300
Tim Tams with tea? Because I
heard that's how you should do

1325
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,650
it, but I had mine with coffee.

1326
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:06,390
Jono: Yeah. Um, so I think tea's
the way you go. You probably

1327
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,545
have

1328
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:09,816
the coffee. I just not sure. I
guess coffee chocolate would be

1329
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,076
a

1330
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:14,766
pretty nice flavor combination.
Um, but there's a thing called

1331
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:19,271
the Tim Tam Slam where you bite
it, like each end of the Tim Tam

1332
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,240
and you like suck the tea or
coffee through the Tim-Tam like

1333
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,069
a

1334
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,800
straw and it like melts the
chocolate a little bit. And then

1335
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,780
you just like shove the whole
thing, your mouth, and you just

1336
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,271
have like a multiple and
chocolate with some crunchy

1337
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:32,911
texture and also the flavor of
the tea or coffee.

1338
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:34,041
Dan: Sounds amazing.

1339
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,090
Jono: Yeah. It's very messy.

1340
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:37,835
Bekah: I feel

1341
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:38,661
Jono: You have to find that

1342
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:41,166
Bekah: stream coming up or where
you're going to be trying out

1343
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:41,315
some

1344
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,890
Dan: Yeah, we gotta, we gotta,
we gotta, get some to some

1345
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,404
people

1346
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:45,666
and we'll do a group, you know?

1347
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:48,795
Bekah: wasn't like I fully
intended to save them for

1348
01:00:48,795 --> 01:00:50,355
virtual

1349
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:54,255
coffees and have them a little
bit at a time just going to do

1350
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:54,405
it.

1351
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:56,361
Jono: that they're just too
good. Yeah. There's a balance

1352
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,786
with Tim

1353
01:00:57,786 --> 01:00:59,841
Tam slams. I've definitely
waited too long in the toughie,

1354
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:01,896
in the

1355
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:05,826
tea dunk and the whole Tim Tam
just like slid off and I've been

1356
01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:08,556
like, well, now I just have a
Tim-Tam in my, and that's less

1357
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:09,485
delicious.

1358
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,335
Dan: Oh, practice. Right. And
practice a little,

1359
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,260
Jono: Yeah, exactly.

1360
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:16,346
Bekah: I've got a practice.

1361
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,990
Jono: It's like the best
practice you could do.

1362
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:22,226
Dan: a man. That sounds really
good.

1363
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,956
Bekah: We're going to do that at
our conference. We'll do some

1364
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:26,396
Tim-Tam slams. That'll be a

1365
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,686
Dan: Yeah, can we get, uh, I
mean, we should reach out it's

1366
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,190
Tim-Tam um, sorry, a brand or,
or like a, you know, a product

1367
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,694
that

1368
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:35,326
a brand makes.

1369
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,970
Jono: it's a product that a
brand makes so on. It is the

1370
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,859
brand, um,

1371
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:42,235
Dan: So that's what we should
reach out to you for a sponsor.

1372
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:43,260
Jono: Exactly.

1373
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:47,695
Dan: Either get the podcast
sponsored by we'll just start it

1374
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:49,436
start every podcast episode with
the Tim Tams.

1375
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:51,626
Bekah: they don't have to give
us money. They just need to

1376
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,231
Jono: Yeah.

1377
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:53,490
Dan: Yeah, no, no, no.

1378
01:01:56,065 --> 01:01:56,425
Bekah: that's it.

1379
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,050
Jono: Oh yeah. That'd be
amazing. I could be, yeah, Tim

1380
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,610
Tams

1381
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,835
little. They also have. So, if
you take a flight back to

1382
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:07,770
Australia, they'll have like
little single pack, Tim Tams

1383
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,705
that

1384
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:12,286
they give you as like, you know,
the plane snack food. So we'll

1385
01:02:12,286 --> 01:02:14,596
have that in the VC swag bag.

1386
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:14,960
Dan: Oh

1387
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:15,695
Bekah: Yes,

1388
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:17,800
Dan: Yep.

1389
01:02:17,885 --> 01:02:18,905
Bekah: so many great ideas.

1390
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:20,521
Dan: Good.

1391
01:02:22,335 --> 01:02:24,225
Bekah: Okay. So I feel like
that's a, a really, oh man. I

1392
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:26,115
was

1393
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:28,755
going to punt so bad right
there. I'm not going to do it.

1394
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:31,395
Nope. Not

1395
01:02:31,396 --> 01:02:33,285
doing it. It's a really great
way to wrap up the podcast. I

1396
01:02:33,285 --> 01:02:35,174
think,

1397
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,935
um, with something, Nope. Still
somebody stopped me from

1398
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:40,365
putting,

1399
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,110
Dan: need more puns on this
podcast. I'm I'm pro I'm pro pro

1400
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,041
pro pun.

1401
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,300
Bekah: I could embrace that. No.
Did you just say no?

1402
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:57,135
Dan: I did not. I, I was I'm in
favor, as I said,

1403
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,621
Bekah: Okay. All right.

1404
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:01,606
Dan: a bus just drove. I don't
know if that's what you heard.

1405
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,311
Bekah: the bus said no, the
universe has

1406
01:03:05,556 --> 01:03:07,775
Dan: I just ignore it. I just
ignore what the, what the bus

1407
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,065
says outside it's you know?

1408
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:09,190
Bekah: Yeah.

1409
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:09,786
Dan: Okay.

1410
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:13,786
Bekah: That seems like the right
thing to do. Um, anyway, thank

1411
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:17,025
you for the Tim Tams and thank
you for being on the podcast. I

1412
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:22,186

good exploration of the digital

1413
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,396
gardening and learning and
growing, and this was a lot of

1414
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:26,476
fun. So thanks for

1415
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:27,771

having me.
