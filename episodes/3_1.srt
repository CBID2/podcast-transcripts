00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,970
Bekah: Hello, and welcome back to
the Virtual Coffee Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,149
Bekah. And this is a podcast that
features members of the Virtual

3
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,420
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee
is an intimate group of

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,480
developers at all stages of their
coding journey. And they're here

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,910
on this podcast, sharing their
stories. And what they've

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,100
learned. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,024
Dan: Hey, Bekah. Um, season
three, that's exciting. We had a

8
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:40,765
really great season two. We heard
from all sorts of people. Yeah.

9
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,914
We had a lot of great
conversations. Um, in the last

10
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,375
season, you know, we talked a lot
about finding your voice and

11
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:49,604
building confidence as a
developer. And I heard a lot of

12
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:53,575
great stories from different
people and it was a blast. And we

13
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,054
are pumped to be back for season
three with some great episodes

14
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:00,695
Bekah: I am very excited to be
back too. And I thought would be

15
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,371
Dan: We're pumped,

16
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:09,506
Bekah: Okay. I am excited and you
are pumped. Okay.

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,930
Dan: very pumped.

18
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:21,117
Bekah: Very excited. As we move
into season three of the podcast,

19
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,268
I thought it would be fun to talk
a little bit about what we've

20
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:29,037
learned as podcast co-hosts. I
think we can talk about all of

21
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:29,608
the seasons

22
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:35,528
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, w
when did our first episode air in

23
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,897
January, something like that. So
it's been half a year or

24
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:43,587
whatever. Um, I've I've learned a
lot. I've learned a ton from the

25
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,677
technical perspective. Um, you
know, producing this, you know,

26
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,668
with, with you is, has been, I
don't just like the new thing to

27
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:58,677
learn every, every week. Uh, it
seems like, um, and it's now I'm

28
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:01,408
at the point where I know all the
things I don't know, you know

29
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:07,707
what I mean? Like, you know,
sound quality stuff, editing, um,

30
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:11,902
things like that. I, I, uh, I've
gotten. To the point where I can

31
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:16,212
do it, you know what I mean? And
so now it's like, now I know all

32
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,802
the things I don't know, or at
least I know that there are a lot

33
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,383
of things. I don't know, you know
what I mean? Um, but it's been

34
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,752
fun. I feel like I've been, I've
been at least from the technical

35
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,782
standpoint of, you know, podcast
stuff. Um, kind of getting my

36
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:30,622
feet under me. Um, so that part's
been cool

37
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,957
Bekah: I can start the intros
without laughing all the time.

38
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:35,182
Dan: Yeah,

39
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,027
Bekah: Most of the time.

40
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:40,723
Dan: I feel like we we've been
using Zencaster and they released

41
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:43,782
a new version of their software,
which was pretty cool, which we

42
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,962
enjoyed a lot. Um, and they have
a countdown thing now. So when

43
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,423
you hit this, you, when you hit
start record, there's a little

44
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,663
countdown. And I feel like that
almost helps us, you know, cause

45
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:56,353
you, I dunno. I feel like that
was where we get tripped up is

46
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,693
cause it hit record and then
there'd be some pause and nobody

47
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,793
knows if they're supposed to talk
or not. You know? So it's a

48
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,862
small, small touch. I feel like
that has helped us.

49
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,332
Bekah: Yeah, well, I think
getting more comfortable to, you

50
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:08,483
know, in the beginning, it was
just, it's different being

51
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:13,612
interviewed for on a podcast than
interviewing other people,

52
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:18,742
because you have a different role
as a host and you're there to try

53
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,473
and tell the story. And I think
it took a little while for me to

54
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:24,712
kind of wrap my head around that
and maybe going into season

55
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:29,663
three, I feel like I've got a
better grasp on storytelling as a

56
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:33,913
podcast. Rather than like, okay,
I have this list of questions and

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,152
we have to hit all the questions.
Like we have some backup

58
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:41,772
questions, but where is the
conversation going and how can we

59
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:45,673
keep that up and tell the story
of the person on the show and

60
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:49,752
think about what, what would
benefit anyone who's listening to

61
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:50,393
the podcast?

62
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:56,027
Dan: Absolutely. Yeah. From the,
from the host point of view, I

63
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,622
have, uh, I don't know, I felt
like I've, I've tried to learn a

64
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,143
lot too, and I'm at the same
point where it's like, okay, now

65
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,782
I can see the things, you know,
that I don't quite do well or

66
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:09,793
that I, you know, think I can
improve on. Um, and you know,

67
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,252
some of them it's clear how to
fix and some of them, some of

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,592
them, it's not always, but, uh,
it's, I don't know. It's a

69
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:18,583
journey and, um, it's, it's been
fun. It's been, and it's also, I

70
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,333
mean, everybody that we talk to
are people that we like and are

71
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,663
part of our community and, you
know, they're friends, some of

72
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,572
them close friends, some of them,
you know, new friends, um, for

73
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,692
me. And, uh, it's been just a
blast to be able to talk to

74
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,593
everybody and learn more about
them personally, too, and hearing

75
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:40,942
everybody's origin stories and,
um, crazy, uh, boat plane

76
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:46,622
training incidents and, uh, you
know, just hearing more about

77
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:51,062
from, you know, from people's
lives. Um, it's one of the things

78
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:54,153
that I like and that I like about
the, um, in our, in a Virtual

79
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,023
Coffee, is when these
conversations get off track and

80
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:01,762
not off track, but, uh, get
whatever, you know, that don't

81
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:05,153
have a track. Right. Um, like you
were saying. And, um, I feel like

82
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:07,452
those always ended up being the
most valuable conversation. So

83
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:08,737
Bekah: Yeah, I love it.

84
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,452
Dan: And it's been cool trying to
apply it here.

85
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:16,153
Bekah: I love chasing a tangent.
It's a good time. And usually

86
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,862
come out with something
interesting, at least.

87
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:20,353
Dan: Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

88
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:25,072
Bekah: And it has been fun. You
know, getting to know people a

89
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,403
lot better and to learn about
their lives and the things that

90
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:33,142
they've gone through. It's really
been great for me. Like you said,

91
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,627
there, there are things that you
take away from. Every episode and

92
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,918
every person that we talked to.
And I just love that after we're

93
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,228
done recording a podcast for
every season where we've recorded

94
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:51,117
almost all of the third season,
but there's always been something

95
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,478
in every episode that I've taken
away and just thought about for

96
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,048
the rest of the week. And it's
really helped to inform the way

97
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,778
that I've done things and the
approaches I take. So it's been

98
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,237
great to be able to have that
live learning experience.

99
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:10,752
Dan: Yeah, I agree. And they, uh,
it's just been like little tiny

100
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:15,103
breakout rooms with just you and
me and one other person. Um, and,

101
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:19,012
uh, it's, it's been really very
cool, very cool experience. And

102
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,382
I'm excited about season three.

103
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:24,372
Bekah: Yeah, we're really excited
to be sharing this season with

104
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:27,492
you all too. Um, we're going to
be talking about recognizing your

105
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:32,502
potential, navigating interviews,
overcoming career stagnation, how

106
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:35,653
to do a proper Tim Tam Slam, and
a lot more.

107
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:40,358
Dan: That's right. So kicking off
season three, episode one, we

108
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,918
have Jono Yeong. Jono is a senior
software engineer. He's

109
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,487
originally from Australia. I is
currently based in Seattle, um,

110
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,822
USA. And he. Okay. So he's
primarily a backend developer,

111
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,673
but is enjoying re-entering the
crazy world of front end

112
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:58,423
development. He loves giving back
to communities and empowering

113
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:01,963
others on their developer
journeys and, um, without such a

114
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:06,793
supportive community, he wouldn't
be where he is today. Uh, and he

115
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:11,543
says, hashbrowns are his guilty
pleasure food. Um, and so, yes,

116
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,872
so today he'll be talking to us
about, digital gardening,

117
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,512
learning elixir, and how to do a
proper Tim Tam Slam.

118
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,918
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

119
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,918
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name where

120
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,088
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. Today's

121
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:33,978
random check-in question is if
you could have one person narrate

122
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:45,093
your life, who would it be? Hey,
I'm Bekah. I'm a front end

123
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:51,454
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And I am going to change

124
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:57,848
the question a little bit, cause
I feel like it. I am. I decided I

125
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:02,889
didn't want a narrator, I wanted
a musical background and I would

126
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,569
just like to choose everyone that
sing in Frozen 2 musical

127
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,689
background to just sing my life
story for me, because that seemed

128
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,158
more fun.

129
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:21,244
Dan: Sure. That would be cool. So
is. It makes me think of Monty

130
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:25,283
Python. Like the, uh, the, the
guy, what is his name, Sir Robin?

131
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,324
you know, the guy following
around Sir Robin: "so boldly

132
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,863
goes, Sir Bekah, she's doing
something. I don't know. I can't

133
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:33,833
think of it, but like, yeah, I
like that musical narration I can

134
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:39,384
get by that. Um, hi, I'm Dan. I
do front-end development. Um, I'm

135
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:44,349
in Cleveland, Ohio, and if I had
to pick a narrator. I was

136
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,869
thinking for a couple of minutes
about this. And, uh, honestly,

137
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:50,649
Sean Connery is who I landed on.
Um, I think it'd be pretty cool.

138
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,528
I, and I just listened to a
podcast about, um, The Rock, the

139
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,448
movie and, um, w which of course
he's, he's in it. And that made

140
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:02,188
me think, oh, man, what about
Nick Cage narrating your life?

141
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:06,808
Which, um, would be, uh, would
be, it could be pretty

142
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,178
interesting too. Um, I'm sticking
with it. I'm sticking with, uh,

143
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,774
Sean Connery, but I, I. I would
like to know what that would

144
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:15,384
sound like, Nick Cage just kind
of narrating somebodies life in

145
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:15,563
their head.

146
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:20,073
Jono: I feel like that's like two
very opposing voices

147
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,453
Dan: Right, right. Yeah. Right.
Which is why that movie is so

148
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:22,903
good, you know?

149
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:29,364
Jono: Yeah. Oh, amazing. Um, hi,
I'm Jonathan. Uh, I am a senior

150
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:34,594
developer at Shopify currently
based in Seattle and jeez, Bekah

151
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,583
threw the curveball and with a
musical number. I am not that

152
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,964
musical, so you're totally fine.
Um, I, you know, I think I would

153
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:45,624
get a fictional character being
Yoda potentially could get

154
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,443
annoying after a while, but, you
know, I think there would be like

155
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,183
wisdom. Right there. And then a
real person, Nick Offerman. I

156
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,453
just hope he laughs at some point
during my life story. Just to get

157
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,104
that sound clipping

158
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:02,583
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. He's he has an
excellent laugh, um, with the

159
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,004
Yoda. yeah, It be worth even. I'd
be, I mean, it would be like

160
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:11,599
great, you know, um, sound wise.
That Yoda would be, just be

161
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,349
judging me all the time.

162
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:13,573
Jono: yeah,

163
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,943
Bekah: I feel like you'd really
have to pay attention. Like you

164
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,224
have to think. Cause he wouldn't
straight forward narrate what

165
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:22,754
would happen? He would just be
dropping Yoda wisdom about what

166
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:23,354
happened

167
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,668
Jono: Yeah, I think he'd make my
life sound

168
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:27,163
Bekah: I don't know.

169
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:28,379
Jono: Yeah.

170
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:35,778
Bekah: I have enough of those
already. Um, so welcome, Jono,

171
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:38,879
we're very happy to have you here
on this third season of the

172
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,668
virtual PA Virtual Coffee podcast
and doing an excellent job

173
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:49,589
already. Um, so we really like to
start with a little bit of the

174
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,089
background, your origin story. So
if you could give us your short

175
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,038
version of how you got to this
point in your.

176
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:03,389
Jono: yeah. Um, I have a pretty
boring or I guess standard

177
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,938
technical background. Um, so I
did a four year degree at

178
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:10,644
university, um, interned at a
company. Um, but during that

179
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:15,583
time, and then at the company, I
was doing iOS work initially, um,

180
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,134
for a few months, and then they
got me on a Ruby on Rails

181
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,134
project. And that's really when I
really fell in love with web

182
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,494
development and decided to kind
of pursue that route. So from

183
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:28,094
there went to kind of be another
kind of Ruby on Rails shop in

184
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:31,244
Sydney. So I'm originally from
Australia. Uh, and then I

185
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:34,033
actually moved to the States. Um,
so working with Rails all the way

186
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,453
through and uh, yeah, now I'm in
Seattle and now on Shopify.

187
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:42,229
Bekah: I don't feel like I could
have you narrate my life, you and

188
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,928
Mike Rogers, like can we go back
and forth between the two. It

189
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,428
would be a very happy time for
me.

190
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,124
Jono: just so much happiness.

191
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:55,668
Bekah: Um, well that, that is
awesome. And we are glad to have

192
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,969
you at Virtual Coffee. I don't
remember when you joined Virtual

193
00:11:58,969 --> 00:11:59,958
Coffee do you?

194
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:05,864
Jono: Um, I, I D I remember, I
remember the circumstances. I was

195
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:10,283
in a Code Newbie chat. And I was
talking about seeing Virtual

196
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,984
Coffee and I tweeted about it.
They're like, Hey, this seems

197
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,864
like a really cool community. And
then I think you mentioned, you

198
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:19,474
tweet at me saying like, Hey,
come join at this time. And, and

199
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,693
let's yeah, I think it all kicked
off and spent almost maybe like

200
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:27,053
six months, maybe more. I don't
know. I can't, but it's time.

201
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:27,524
Bekah: Right.

202
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:32,884
Dan: Yeah. we were, we, we just,
uh, recorded our podcast episode,

203
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,528
wrapping up, um, season two,
right. We're talking about that

204
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,778
too. Like looking back on time.
And I was just, I just kept

205
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:41,408
throwing out random numbers of
months. Cause I literally, I have

206
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,889
no idea. I have no idea. It was,
uh, you know, it was after the

207
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,989
pandemic started. I know that
much. And then after that, I'm

208
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,678
just like, I don't know. It's all
just a big cloud.

209
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:55,943
Bekah: Yeah. Um, so one of the
things that I think would be cool

210
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:01,494
to talk about, I know you updated
your site yesterday or sometime,

211
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,683
and it looks really awesome. So
we'll post that in the show

212
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:08,124
notes, but you, um, there's this
concept of digital gardening that

213
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,994
you talk about, and I think you
practice, so I'd love to start

214
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:16,793
there. First of all, what is,
what, what does that even mean?

215
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,573
Digital gardening.

216
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:22,484
Jono: Yeah. Um, so digital
gardening is really about

217
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:27,673
curating your posts. Like you
don't need to have fully formed

218
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:32,918
or finished. Um, written work.
It's, it's really about having a

219
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:37,869
thought and then building on that
thought over time. Um, and it's

220
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,038
kind of the opposite of a blog,
which is almost like a feed with

221
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,068
that sorted in chronological
order. Um, so with your digital

222
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,469
garden, you kind of pick and
choose what you want to present

223
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:51,448
up front. And it's really about
that curation. Um, I definitely.

224
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:54,754
Got heavily inspired by Maggie
Appleton. So definitely go check

225
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:59,283
out her blog as well, which is
also a digital garden. Um, her

226
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,533
artwork is beautiful and she
explains it really well over

227
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:01,774
there.

228
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,389
Dan: Yeah. I've seen a couple
other examples like that and

229
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:09,048
Maggie Appleton site that is the
first one I, I think I saw too,

230
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,798
um, they don't let it out of this
whole concept. I think that's

231
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:16,323
really cool. So do you, um, And
this is something I've been sort

232
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,484
of interested in for a while too,
but, um, haven't really, you

233
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:23,014
know, my blog is old and I don't
update it that often. Um, but it

234
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:26,494
is still like old, you know, that
regular style. Um, so when you're

235
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,274
doing like the curation process,
right, for older posts, do you

236
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:34,604
just re like remove them or what,
like, or do you tuck them away

237
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:37,153
somewhere or, uh, you know, like,
can you explain a little more

238
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,614
about how you handle like that
sort of stuff that maybe isn't

239
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:42,364
super relevant anymore, but, you
did write it, you know, five

240
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,203
years ago or something.

241
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:47,024
Jono: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um,
so I think the curation in my

242
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:50,114
mind, uh, yes, to some posts
going away. So I actually removed

243
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:53,533
a bunch of posts that, um, when I
was migrating over to this new

244
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:59,379
site redesign. And then also, um,
being okay with putting a big

245
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,129
"work in progress" box. So it
actually on the, uh, I have a

246
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,839
post about GitHub and Notion and
notion this was pre Notions API,

247
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,288
and this was really just about
how I organize our projects. Um,

248
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:15,399
but. Now that Notion has an API,
it would make a lot of sense to

249
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,889
make something, wake it up and
nurse, and actually talk to each

250
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,859
other. So I put it like a big
alert and box saying like, Hey, I

251
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,489
am going to be working on this.
Um, you expect things to change

252
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:28,578
Dan: So as you update that post
and I did I read that post, I

253
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,249
really enjoyed it. Um, as you
update it, plan is what will be

254
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,849
to literally update that post as
opposed to doing a part two or

255
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,818
see this or whatever. Um, things
like that.

256
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,639
Jono: Yeah, exactly.

257
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,979
Dan: That's, that's pretty
interesting. And it is, and like

258
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,094
I have seen other people do it.
It's it's, uh, There's the

259
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:52,874
question of like time with
regards to technical content,

260
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,153
especially, it's always sort of
interested in to try to handle,

261
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:59,323
right. And I have, um, one of my
...and I mean, a lot of this is

262
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:02,653
because I don't write that often,
but still one of the posts on my

263
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:06,703
site that gets the most traffic
is, um, some old CSS like float

264
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,104
hack thing, you know? And it's
still like, I mean, it still

265
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:12,073
works, but it's like, you know,
not at all anything, I would tell

266
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:17,594
somebody to do now. You know what
I mean? Um, and yeah. I've

267
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:21,644
thought about, I've thought about
how to handle that or, um, so,

268
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:25,274
so, so if this was a digital
garden, I suppose the answer

269
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:29,624
would be to, uh, well, either
toss it and just point them back

270
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:34,783
to the main page. Right. Or just
rewrite the whole article at that

271
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,823
same URL or something like that.

272
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,354
Jono: Yeah, I mean, you, um, I
mean, you can keep that old posts

273
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,693
around, like it's, it's really
your playground. You can really

274
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,734
do whatever you want with it. Um,
there's no really hard and fast

275
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:48,573
rules. Um, I think like if you
wanted to toss it or update it

276
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,004
and utility could, you could also
write like, uh, a new update

277
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:54,634
paste. I think the key idea is
really just not waiting for

278
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,563
perfect to publish. So you don't
need to, you can just publish a

279
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:02,599
thought. And it will be okay. Um,
and I think this reminds me of

280
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,898
someone in Virtual Coffee, maybe
it was Vic, who just did a timer

281
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,388
and was like, I'm just gonna
write what I can. And by the end

282
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,699
of the time, I'm just gonna
publish this. I think that like,

283
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,098
feels like that digital garden
essence to me,

284
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:16,108
Dan: Yeah, Vic has been doing a
lot of that kind of stuff. And

285
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:18,929
he's been someone that I've
admired his work with that too,

286
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,348
that the not perfect. The, uh,
get, get it out the door kind of

287
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:26,219
get published. Um, thing has
been, has been really cool. Um, I

288
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,409
would say inspirational. I don't
know if you can be inspired if

289
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,068
you haven't actually gone and
done it. I mean, I haven't

290
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:35,148
actually gone, um, done anything
with it, but it is, uh, it is

291
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:39,344
cool to see. I do like that
attitude, you know? Um,

292
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:43,513
Bekah: I mean, for me, the hard
part would be going back and

293
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:48,973
updating things. Like I get them
out and then I don't, this is, I

294
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:52,094
mean, I have a master's in
English and it was the same

295
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:56,848
thing. Like I, I got excited. I
wrote the paper and then. Like to

296
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:04,048
go back and edit was the worst.
So I don't know, like how do you

297
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,959
motivate yourself to do that? Or
are you like, well, I'm not

298
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,798
motivated. So then this isn't
something that I need and you can

299
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,759
take it away or just say, like,
this is a weed,

300
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,364
Jono: Yeah. Yeah. That's a great
question. I think it's, it's

301
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,548
definitely going to be. A work in
progress as in like, I'm still

302
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:26,019
trying to figure out that, um,
process a little bit more. Um, I

303
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:29,169
know that when I was trying to
write like a blog post every week

304
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,848
or every two weeks, and just
trying to like push out a new

305
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:34,739
content, it became. Really hard.
And I was in a bit of a rut.

306
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,989
Like, it just felt like I was
going from deadline to deadline.

307
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,818
So like giving space to not need
to write a new post every single

308
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:45,419
week, but be okay with like
updating whole pace, mainly just

309
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,939
also I'm lazy. So like, it'd be
nice if we could just tell you

310
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,009
something that's already rating
and then just add a little bit to

311
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,229
it as, okay. So like writing a
whole thing thing.

312
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:57,673
Dan: Yeah, I was. You know,
speaking of doing that, you know,

313
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,344
lots of people will make a goal
like that, of a blog post or

314
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:03,284
whatever. I think that, you know,
thinking about it, it seems to me

315
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:05,084
like the most important part is
actually just writing, like the

316
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:10,453
habit of writing and publishing
something every week is, uh, you

317
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,334
know, sort of a straightforward
goal right. To do. But I was

318
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:16,334
listening to podcasts, uh, maybe
the indie hackers one a while

319
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:19,423
ago. And, uh, they're talking
about, I don't remember who the

320
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,003
guest was, but he was talking
about, um, like long form writing

321
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,844
instead of, um, instead of lots
of lots. Posts, you know, one

322
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:28,423
post that takes them months to
do, and it's long, you know, a

323
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:31,034
long read or whatever, but that
they found it to be much more,

324
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:35,384
um, for himself like writing, uh,
to be, to be much more enjoyable,

325
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,473
which I, which I've been
interested in too recently. And I

326
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,203
th I feel like that could fit
really well into the digital

327
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,874
garden model, because you could
even do your drafts if you wanted

328
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:49,483
to, um, or parts or whatever, you
know, and keep it going. Uh, like

329
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:52,634
that'd be kind of cool to see. It
would be cool to see it like. To

330
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:55,634
like, watch it grow. You know, if
we're going to keep down the,

331
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,374
the, like the metaphor, the
garden metaphor.

332
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,528
Jono: Yeah, I really liked that
point of, um, you know, doing

333
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:04,729
what you enjoy, because I think
that is really the key to it all.

334
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,338
Like you could write deadlines,
you could have deadlines and

335
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,979
write blog posts, but like, if
there's no way or like, you're

336
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,348
just doing it because you have
to, it's not that fun, then

337
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,368
you're not going to keep doing
it.

338
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:16,574
Dan: Right, right. I mean, that's
been my that's my, my personal

339
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:21,763
experiences a lot of times. Yeah.
Things. And like, that's what,

340
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:24,523
that's one of the reasons why
it's good to build habits, you

341
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:29,173
know, because the, sometimes it's
just over, it's hard to sit down

342
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,483
and write, you know, but if it's
like a thing you're used to

343
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:37,288
doing, then. Then that part is
not hard anymore. And then it's

344
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:40,199
like, well then it's actually
writing that you have to deal

345
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:44,519
with, but it's your mind makes it
not as big of a deal. At least

346
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:44,759
for me.

347
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,044
Bekah: And I liked the point
about like, writing what you

348
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,923
enjoy, because I also see a lot
of people that are writing things

349
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:54,223
that they don't enjoy and they
hate doing it, but they just keep

350
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,743
doing it. Cause they think that
they need to do it, which just,

351
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:02,144
um, just sounds really miserable.
So how do you find w okay, one,

352
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,864
what do you enjoy writing about,
like, how do you go after that?

353
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,493
When you're writing.

354
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:11,913
Jono: Yeah. Um, man, that is a
great question. So I've figured

355
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:15,723
out that I really don't enjoy
writing tutorials. Um, they take

356
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:21,574
me a lot of time and I feel like
I don't do it very well, so

357
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:24,153
there's that. Um, but I think
like, what am I most enjoy is

358
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:27,693
really just exploring new tech
and then just kind of getting

359
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:31,979
into like, How I align and what
my process is. So I really like

360
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,969
writing about personal stuff as
opposed to like technological

361
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:36,298
stuff.

362
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,074
Bekah: Do you think that you
write, or would you say that.

363
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:46,874
Right, because you think you
should be writing as a developer

364
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:50,653
just to kind of, um, extend
yourself into the community or

365
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:54,013
it's just something that, that
you want to.

366
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,308
Jono: yeah, it actually started
off being like, oh, I should be

367
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,769
doing this. You know, I should be
writing. You should have a blog,

368
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,548
just so you get the exposure and
you can tweet about something.

369
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:08,028
Um, but it's kind of
transitioning a bit more into

370
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,848
like, I'm trying to find the
enjoyment out of writing and like

371
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:15,138
figuring out like why I like
doing this and then realizing

372
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:18,388
that. Writing or getting better
at writing and reading

373
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,638
communication, just kind of
everywhere. Like it's pervasive.

374
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,358
It's not just in a blog post. Um,
but like, I'll do this at work

375
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,459
where I'm writing documentation
and like emails and stuff like

376
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,159
that. Like that's all really
important. And I've only really

377
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,888
just started realizing that a
year ago or something

378
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:37,163
Bekah: Yeah. So I talked to the
tech interview study group a

379
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:40,943
couple of months ago, and we, I
was talking about networking and

380
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:45,249
one of the things that I said was
that. A lot of times we have this

381
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:49,719
very, um, narrow idea of what
networking is, but in our

382
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,868
industry and the things that we
do, we can create a wider

383
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:57,669
network. So networking can be
writing a blog post or tweeting,

384
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,298
or, you know, like curating that
digital garden. And so that

385
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:03,818
allows you to have a community
that you don't know. And

386
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:06,219
sometimes it's really fun to
like, especially at virtual.

387
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,398
Someone will come and be like,
oh, I read your post this one

388
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:13,088
time. You're like, oh, that's
cool. Um, so it was really nice

389
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:17,469
to kind of extend yourself out
there and in kind of meet people

390
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:18,429
without even knowing it.

391
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,130
Jono: totally agree.

392
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:23,502
Dan: I was just looking back at
your blog posts. So in your, for

393
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,992
the readers, I will obviously
post this, but, um, the blog

394
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:29,032
posts you were talking about how
you use Notion and, um, GitHub

395
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:34,333
Projects together right. To, to,
to track side projects. So, um,

396
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,603
so one thing I was, I was just
like, kind of curious about was,

397
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:40,692
um, what, like what you like to
do with side projects or what

398
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:42,932
kind of things do you have going
on? Are they, I don't are they,

399
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:46,022
are they just like fun? Are they
like hobbies? Are they, um, you

400
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,712
know, possible revenue sources
like that sort of thing. Um, I

401
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,542
was wondering kind of how you
approach, um, the side project

402
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:51,992
life.

403
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,998
Jono: Yeah. Yeah. That's uh,
yeah. I have a lot of, I think,

404
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:59,567
fun side projects and there's a
lot that I've just started and

405
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,317
like have never like finished or
touched after the initial start.

406
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:07,337
Um, as I'm sure a lot of
developers do. Um, but yeah, most

407
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,397
of them are around like how, how
can I learn this thing? So we'll

408
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,627
have a sub project around like a
concept or something like that.

409
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:16,603
Want to learn. Um, I hate, so
this is where, cause I am on a

410
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:19,153
visa, so it's kind of weird. I
don't know if I can actually add

411
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,553
another revenue stream. So I
haven't really been pushing

412
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:25,992
towards like doing that stuff.
Um, but yeah, that's, that's

413
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:26,353
where I am.

414
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:30,103
Dan: That is interesting. I have
no idea. I mean, I have no idea

415
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,232
how that works. Probably a good
thing to check out, I suppose, if

416
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:35,143
you were going to, if you were
going to step into that, but, um,

417
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,182
honestly, maybe it might, that
might make, uh, some of your

418
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:38,982
decision-making easier could,
right? Cause you don't have to

419
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:41,442
think about it. Don't have to,
don't have to worry about that

420
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:44,502
part. Uh, you know, for awhile
that's kind of fun. Is there any

421
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:47,323
specific one that you've been
into recently? Any of your side

422
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:47,682
projects?

423
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:51,736
Jono: Yeah. So, um, well this
personal website was, I guess a

424
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:54,472
side project, just because like I
was building svelte kit, um,

425
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:57,413
something that I've never really
built before I'll use before. Um,

426
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,282
and then on the other side, I'm
learning a bit more about Lixa

427
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:04,923
ElixirPhoenix. So I've been
building. This thing that I'm

428
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:08,913
trying to document on YouTube,
which is a, uh, like a, a social

429
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:11,923
media app for, for puppies. I
don't know if that makes sense,

430
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:15,182
not, but essentially it's like,
you can, you have like a bunch of

431
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:18,303
puppies that you add to the side
and you can follow dogs and you

432
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:20,792
can have like little meetups and
stuff. That's, that's the grand

433
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,192
idea, but it's really just about
a learning project.

434
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:24,613
Dan: That's that's

435
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:29,022
Bekah: Can you just talk a little
bit about what elixir is? Just

436
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:32,563
give some definitions for the
things that you talked about.

437
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:36,067
Jono: Yeah, no, that's great. Um,
so Elixir is a functional

438
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,478
programming language. Um, it's
written by José Valim and it has

439
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:45,843
a lot of. Um, Ruby ish syntax. So
if you come from Ruby, you kinda,

440
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:49,323
you feel like that initial layer
feels a little like Ruby, um, but

441
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:51,482
then when you really dig down
into it, it's all about

442
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,853
functional programming languages.
So, uh, immutability is kind of

443
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,567
like a, a big component of it.
Yeah, there's all these like

444
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:01,377
little extra features. Um, and
the language itself is an

445
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:05,637
interpreted language. So it's
built on top of Erlang. Um, so

446
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:09,988
think like Ruby is kind of built
on top of C almost. Um, so

447
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,758
everything can compile as down to
Erlang.

448
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,883
Dan: That's pretty cool. Yeah.
There's a lot of, a lot of

449
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,702
interest in the functional
programming languages, you know,

450
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:22,998
uh, space, you know, these days,
which, which I enjoy. You know,

451
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:26,688
on a nerd level, I haven't really
dug into any of them. Um, you

452
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,738
know, I know Kirk is into shoot.
I can't remember it was called,

453
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:31,278
um,

454
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:37,472
Jono: uh, F no, no shop hassle.
No, throwing out

455
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:37,768
Dan: uh,

456
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,182
Bekah: No.

457
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:39,692
Jono: Nice.

458
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:43,678
Dan: it's just silly because I
actually like contributed to it.

459
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,337
Project and I can't, I'm totally
blank on the name. I'm sorry.

460
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:51,117
I'll come up with it. Um, but
anyway, it's, it's, uh, I don't

461
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,758
know. It's neat. The functional
stuff I really enjoyed when I, I

462
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:56,698
did computer science for a couple
of years in, um, in college and

463
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,178
enjoyed it. There was a language
called scheme that we used, um,

464
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:03,178
in school and it was just fun. I
don't know. It's neat. It's a,

465
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:07,077
it's a cool little, uh, paradigm.
Um, I ended up, I ended up, uh,

466
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,817
in JavaScript. JavaScript itself
is not functional, like strictly,

467
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:15,403
but you can. You can like lean
that way pretty hard, you know,

468
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:18,133
it's, it's fun. It's kind of fun
to, to do that.

469
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:22,157
Jono: Yeah, absolutely. I think
those, like, I see the whole

470
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:25,228
reason why I moved. Like started
learning about Elixir was, cause

471
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:29,577
I kinda was burned by, by few
things in Ruby and JavaScript

472
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:32,157
where it was mutable, but it
wasn't obvious that it was

473
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:35,428
mutable. Um, like the example
comes to mind, which is I was

474
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,928
working on my personal site. Um,
was the JavaScript Sort(), it

475
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:42,718
like sorts in place and it
changes the underlying object and

476
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,387
it just like break everything.
Yes.

477
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:50,053
Dan: Yep. Yep. Uh, yeah. Thank
you, Bekah Elm. It was, uh, it

478
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:54,073
was Elm. That was the language I
was talking about. Um, the, Yes.

479
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:58,182
uh, I came up with, uh, on PHP,
uh, and it's even more absurd

480
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:00,673
than JavaScript in that regard.
It's got a lot better, but, um,

481
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:04,333
yeah. Uh, you know, the, you
never really know if it's going

482
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,992
to be like, if it's gonna mutate.
Object and place or return a new

483
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:11,383
on it. It does both really. And
so, yeah, I see you like you get,

484
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:14,952
you get the new one and you think
in cool, but you know, you go

485
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:17,952
back to the old one, it turns out
that one's changed. It's not fun.

486
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:23,982
Uh, PHP also has like, they, I
mean, they, like I said, they've,

487
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:27,272
they've improved a lot, but, um,
you know, all these different

488
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,803
array functions, some of them
came from Perl and some came from

489
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:33,492
like, C, and so named, like,
there was like, you never knew if

490
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:37,647
it was gonna be array underscore
sort or like. With no array and,

491
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:42,298
you know, like all this nonsense,
uh, that I loved, but, um, it was

492
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:44,057
very hard to deal with it as
well. Sometimes. Yes.

493
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,048
Jono: How do people write
programs back then? Like, I don't

494
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:47,508
understand.

495
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:52,248
Dan: Yeah. Um, like lots of, lots
of, you know, trying and failing

496
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:55,698
and lots of bugs that nobody
knows about until it's so much

497
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:59,768
later and you know, all that sort
of stuff, no tests, FTP, you

498
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,907
know, hit save, and then FTP up
to the server and see if It.

499
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,343
works. Uh, that's how I did it.
Anyway. I don't know.

500
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:10,292
Bekah: When I was first building
my blog, I didn't know that you

501
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:15,063
could run things locally. And I
also didn't know, like, so I was

502
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:19,262
just like committing things and
seeing if they worked or not. So

503
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:23,702
I don't even want to go back to
when I first started that repo

504
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:27,303
because all of the stuff in there
is just me making like these

505
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:31,907
minor tweaks or seriously messing
things up. Oh, how do you want to

506
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:34,877
do that? Because I also didn't
know that you could take back to

507
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:40,038
meds. You can change things. It
was a, it was a wild time, I

508
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:40,607
think back then.

509
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:45,333
Jono: Yeah, I still make those
kinds of commits. Like I made a

510
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,972
bunch of commits where I'm just
like removing a trailing slash

511
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,542
just to see if like my HTML tag
is working properly. I'm like,

512
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,002
okay, well this isn't working, I
have no idea what I'm doing.

513
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,482
Dan: Yeah. That's all right.
That's what like squash merges

514
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:02,952
before, right. Just hide all that
stuff. Yeah, no, I was, um, I was

515
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:08,593
working on the, um, um, get up
our, uh, I mean, I'm sorry, our

516
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:13,782
co-working sort of room, um, and
involves, uh, like a slack app

517
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:19,063
and a zoom app and Netlify
functions, um, up until a point

518
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:21,792
you can kind of point it to local
your local stuff. Um, but

519
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:25,182
eventually you have to like point
it to a server that you have to

520
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:28,587
point the, the zoom app or the
Slack App, to a server. And that

521
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:30,837
was incredibly hard to test. I
was, I ended up doing. the same

522
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:33,627
thing. I was just like, I was
sending stuff up and have it, you

523
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:36,928
know, deploy and then see if it
works. Um, I have A I have a

524
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,837
slack, like a test slack
workspace, you know, that's just

525
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:45,178
like, Dan's whatever test Slack
and, uh, there's like 4,000 Dan's

526
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:49,498
in there. Cause I was testing a
new, you know, like what happens

527
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:53,248
when a member joins, you know?
And um, if I didn't get it right

528
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,163
then I had. Make the change,
commit it, let it build and then

529
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,133
join again, you know, with the
new account and see if it works.

530
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,022
It's like the matrix with Agent
Smith is like, uh, it's just like

531
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:09,373
a slack that's just full of a
thousand mes. Don't go there.

532
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:18,732
It's frightening. I'll say I'll
send you an invite. You uh, yeah.

533
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:19,752
Oh

534
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:24,597
Bekah: So you also talked about,
um, doing videos. And so I wonder

535
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,847
like one does, can you digital
garden videos? Is that a thing?

536
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,468
Is that like Instagram live? I
don't know.

537
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:34,258
Jono: Maybe.

538
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:37,048
Bekah: how does that like play
into this role of content

539
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:37,407
creation?

540
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:44,417
Jono: Yeah. Oh man. Interesting.
I, I would say digitally

541
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:49,407
gardening videos is harder. Then
writing because you have to do a

542
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,617
lot more editing in the video.
Um, you can't really just cut a

543
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:55,317
piece out and then like add a new
piece in it. Wouldn't like tend

544
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,448
to make sense or missed, um,

545
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,137
Dan: Have you tried, have you
tried, uh, have you

546
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,968
tried,Descript yet for video
editing

547
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:05,367
Jono: I haven't. No, I've been
sticking with a

548
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:09,377
Dan: you can literally copy and
paste like text and it'll do the

549
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,867
video and the audio and
everything like really well. I'm

550
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,448
sorry. They don't, they don't
sponsor us or anything. I just,

551
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,458
I've just been excited about it

552
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,178
Jono: wondering. Yeah.

553
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:21,798
Dan: Sorry, I didn't mean to, um,
while I did, I guess I did mean

554
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:23,067
to interrupt, but, uh, I didn't
want,

555
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:23,188
Bekah: Okay.

556
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,107
Dan: I didn't, I don't know why I
said, I don't know why like

557
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:28,847
interrupt on purpose and then
say, sorry, I didn't mean to

558
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,577
interrupt. Uh, anyway, um,

559
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:35,712
Jono: okay. No. You're good.
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I think

560
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:38,323
that's a really, there's so many
tools out there, which is great.

561
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,722
And like, I think Bekah mentioned
live streaming as well, which I

562
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,732
guess like you can kind of pick
and choose Nicky T is doing a

563
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,462
really great job with live
streaming and he's kind of like

564
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:49,012
rolling with the punches and
learning Rust, which I think is

565
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:54,202
really cool. Um, I do think like
where, where I see video, because

566
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:56,242
it is completely different
platform. It's kind of like

567
00:32:56,272 --> 00:33:01,597
YouTube, so that. You can't
really curate YouTube videos as

568
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,357
easily. It's like that they own
that platform. So they tend to

569
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,198
show it how they want to show it.
Um, so it is a little bit harder

570
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:08,917
in that sense,

571
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:11,383
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. And I think with
YouTube, you can't change them

572
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:13,303
either. Right? I mean, if you
change them and then, then it's a

573
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:17,202
new, you have to create a new
video and delete the old on or so

574
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:17,833
you know, something like

575
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,817
Jono: right? Yeah. Although yeah,
exactly.

576
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:22,313
Dan: yeah.

577
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,587
Bekah: Create new ones.

578
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:24,593
Dan: That's interesting though.

579
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:25,528
Jono: Yeah.

580
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:29,387
Bekah: Now we're going to invent
digital gardening for videos

581
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:31,073
Jono: That would be cool.

582
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:40,508
Bekah: or it wouldn't at all. So,
okay. So you're doing these

583
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:44,347
videos and is this just kind of
along the same lines as what

584
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:48,458
you're doing with your digital
garden, your. Working on these

585
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,968
things, learning them, and then
just providing another avenue for

586
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,738
people to kind of learn along
with you.

587
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:57,837
Jono: yeah, I think like, yeah,
exactly that, and it was also a

588
00:33:57,837 --> 00:34:00,837
challenge for me, cause I'd never
really done video stuff as well.

589
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,597
So at the start of the year, I
really wanted to kind of explore

590
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:07,942
it a little bit more. Um, and
then. Um, I kinda, uh, realized

591
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,822
that I really enjoy doing it. I
don't enjoy actually filming the

592
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:13,282
videos. It's really hard, or I
can't speak in front of a camera.

593
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:16,552
Like, I don't know how people do
it. Um, but the whole process of

594
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,282
like editing and like getting all
the music and all that stuff is,

595
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:24,563
is really fun. Um, so yeah, it's,
it's been a goal and a lot of the

596
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:29,242
content is pretty similar to what
I would put in. The blog, but it

597
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:33,413
does go through more in-depth
tutorials because I hate writing

598
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,782
about tutorials, but I think
showing is just a lot easier to

599
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,822
follow and a lot easier to
explain in my mind,

600
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:41,588
Dan: Yeah, that's, that's pretty
cool. and so you can I suppose,

601
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,628
yeah, you don't have to like
create all the screenshots or

602
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:47,619
the, uh, you know, grab the code
examples perfectly if you're just

603
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,719
showing, you know, when you're
doing like a screen-share and

604
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,458
showing the, um, the app like in
place, right. Just take somebody

605
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,219
for a tour. I can totally see. I
can totally see how that it, that

606
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:57,518
would be.

607
00:34:57,673 --> 00:35:01,264
Jono: Yeah, and you can go on
like tangents and you can get

608
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,844
lost a little bit, and it's all
easy to come back to the main

609
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:06,463
thread. Then it isn't like a
blog, like you can't just write

610
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:10,353
like an extra thousand words on a
tangent and then expect them to

611
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,034
like keep reading after that.
Okay.

612
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:14,838
Dan: You could, but, uh,

613
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:18,778
Bekah: I think I just, uh, wait,
I have to go back and delete some

614
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:19,409
of my blog posts.

615
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,358
Dan: um, have you been doing, I'm
sorry if I might have already

616
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:27,759
answered this, have you been
doing much streaming as well? Um,

617
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:29,798
aside from the produced months,
have you dug into that?

618
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:35,043
Jono: no, I haven't. Um, I've
been thinking about it. I don't,

619
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:41,704
uh, we come back to Nick. Um, I
can't speak and like learn or

620
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:45,333
like do something at the same
time. So it really just be like,

621
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:48,543
it would just be silence. He used
to be watching me on my computer.

622
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,824
It's a skill. I don't know how
you do that.

623
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:53,623
Dan: Yeah, no, it is. I've been,
I've been have been wondering

624
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,753
about that. too. I've been
thinking about, you know, digging

625
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,224
a little bit, and this is paying
attention to myself. Coding, not,

626
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,353
I wasn't streaming, you know, but
I was just like, oh, I haven't

627
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:06,583
like talked to moved for like
three hours. Like this is not

628
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,724
going to be fun for anybody.

629
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:10,244
Bekah: I think, I think one of
the things that's about it is

630
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:12,914
it's nice if you can do with a
partner, because then they can

631
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:16,693
kind of fill in, like, Nick does
it with Christina and Seth and I

632
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:20,954
are going to be doing it in a
couple of weeks. Um, and the

633
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:23,143
first time Seth and I did it, it
was like I had not ever

634
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:26,353
live-streamed and I'm, I'm
terrified of it. Like it's not

635
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:30,673
something that I feel comfortable
doing and immediately I froze up.

636
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:33,418
And Seth was right there, kind of
like talking through it, like,

637
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:35,018
okay, well, this is what we're
going to do. And this is where

638
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,188
I'm like, okay, now I feel
comfortable and I can kind of go

639
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:41,458
along with it. And so to be able
to have that conversation, I

640
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,608
think makes it a little bit
easier because then you have way

641
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:47,059
less pressure on yourself to be
doing all of this.

642
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:51,934
Jono: 100%. That that makes a lot
of sense.

643
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,789
Dan: Yeah. I've, I've enjoyed
times when we just jump on a zoom

644
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,679
or whatever, and, and people, you
know, like,if somebody posts in

645
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,739
help and pairing or something. It
has a problem. Right. And pairing

646
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,688
up, like doing the pair
programming and just sort of

647
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,989
recording it. I think that's,
you're talking about Bekah and

648
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:10,278
like, it's easier for me to ask
questions or to answer questions

649
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,878
then to like on a, don't think of
all possible questions and then

650
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:17,358
produce content, you know, like
that, the, uh, the thought

651
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,768
process for me. Um, it's like,
um, I don't know, you know, you

652
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,748
just like answer what's in front
of you. Right. And then, and then

653
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:29,514
just talk, but the, I feel like
when you're streaming, it's. Um,

654
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:31,943
the expectation is maybe it's a
little more okay. If you make a

655
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:35,873
mistake or if you, you know, um,
start saying something and then

656
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:37,793
you're like, oh, wait a minute. I
just remembered this other thing.

657
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:42,204
Or, you know, something like
that. Um, a little more, like, I

658
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:45,869
don't know if it's a little more
into that. The it's okay to make

659
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,539
mistakes mindsets, right. It's
like not perfect mindset is the

660
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,619
streaming. Um, which I try to
remember to when I, when I

661
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,259
consider it and right, is, um,
it's like the work in progress

662
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:58,228
kind of thing. Um, I could see
how it could all fit, fit, fit

663
00:37:58,228 --> 00:37:58,889
together, you know?

664
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,664
Jono: Yeah, I think that's the
beauty of live streaming as well

665
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:06,253
as the fact that you can kind of
make these mistakes and like let

666
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:09,614
other people see how you kind of
move on from there. Um, I think

667
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:13,333
with videos, um, I'm actually
trying to do a video where I'm

668
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,483
trying to show that process a bit
more. Um, but with videos it is

669
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:17,114
very edited.

670
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:17,713
Dan: Right,

671
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,003
Jono: Um, so you don't see that.

672
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:23,224
Dan: right. Well, yes. If you
went onto YouTube and push play

673
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:26,103
on somebody's video, you wouldn't
want to see them saying, um, you

674
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,554
know, I'm not really sure how to
do this, but like watching the

675
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,713
thought process in a stream, the
expectations a little bit, like

676
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:34,594
you go into a stream knowing that
it's live right. And knowing

677
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:37,349
that. Probably going to be doing
that sort of thing. You know what

678
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,449
I mean? Figuring it out in front
of you. And that's part of the,

679
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,998
part of the draw, I suppose. I
mean, definitely part of the

680
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:45,809
draw, but, um, a little bit
different mindset, I suppose,

681
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,246
when you're creating, you know,
as a creator. Right. Are you

682
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:52,626
going to add your videos to your
site, to the, to the digital

683
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,516
garden. Um, and in some way

684
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:59,655
Jono: Yeah. I, um, I had a, like
a fleeting thought about adding

685
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:05,135
like the most recent video. Um, I
think like, ultimately I'd love

686
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:09,661
to create like a, a platform
where I can add tutorials like my

687
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:13,291
own course platform kind of
thing, then have everything just,

688
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,570
you know, work in one place,

689
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,311
Dan: Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. So
you have like a collection of,

690
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,650
uh, yeah. Step one, step two,
step three kind of thing. Yeah.

691
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,291
Jono: Yeah.

692
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,311
Dan: Um, that, well, I mean,
there's, I mean, I could, I could

693
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,891
see that being fitting pretty
well into the digital garden. You

694
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:32,190
know, I idea I could also see it,
you know, there's lots of

695
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,121
obviously lots of different, uh,
approaches to that, to that, um,

696
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,280
that that people have done. So
that's pretty cool.

697
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,155
Bekah: So for these, it seems
like you have a lot of you're

698
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,916
working on a lot of things that
you are learning about

699
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:52,036
personally. Um, and then when you
are, are working in your day job,

700
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:57,315
you're working with rails, right?
And so how do you just kind of

701
00:39:57,315 --> 00:40:01,876
like make that jump back and
forth or, you know, are there

702
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:05,266
things that you're learning from
what you're learning that you can

703
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,186
apply to your day job?

704
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,181
Jono: Yeah. I think like both of
that is like totally valid point.

705
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:17,300
It's like jumping back and forth
between functional to like object

706
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:21,860
paradigm is, is really hard
sometimes. Um, I'm not very good

707
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,771
at functional language, I guess
that helps, you know, like I

708
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,740
gotta have those like muscle
memory, um, yet. Um, but yeah,

709
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,710
there's definitely things you can
learn from all these different

710
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:37,170
sources that, um, You can bring
into any new project, um, had

711
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,271
there a quote somewhere where
it's like, you never starting

712
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,670
anything from scratch. Like you
always taking those past

713
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,940
experiences with you. And I think
that's very true. Um, whenever

714
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,561
I'm learning any of these new
things, is that from Vic as well?

715
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,436
Bekah: I was going to say,

716
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,541
Jono: I'm like, gosh,

717
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,056
Bekah: I remember Vic talking
about that.

718
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:55,465
Dan: Yep. And we talked about
that with Sara, a bunch too, on,

719
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,775
on when, when she came on the pod
is, you know, I mean, she came

720
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:02,585
from, you know, the agriculture
tech field and, uh, you know, was

721
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:06,606
able to apply a lot of that, Um,
to her current. yeah. It's moved

722
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:11,226
from that to, well, FinTech, I
guess. But, um, I do like that

723
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:15,706
idea. We've talked about it
before, you know, it's that idea

724
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,525
of leaning on your past
experiences, you know, and how it

725
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:22,846
can all be relevant, um, relevant
to you or to your current, um,

726
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,726
platform. It's funny thinking
about that switch in between,

727
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,445
like when you're learning a new
paradigm sort of, and you have an

728
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,195
old one, it's like that balance
point of when your muscle memory

729
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:36,166
tips over and you start actually
like reaching for functional

730
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,315
things when you're in back in
Ruby or, you know, uh, vice

731
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:44,311
versa. Um, When you're so when
you're learning, um, so this is,

732
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,990
uh, wait, I'm sorry. Oh, Elixir.
Right. Um, so you're learning

733
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,460
elixir. Do you find yourself
doing things like, um, how do I

734
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,971
do some Ruby thing in elixir like
that kind of Google, Google

735
00:41:56,971 --> 00:42:01,710
search, a thought process, or, or
do you try to, um, sort of erase

736
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,871
your mind for, for, for the
moment, you know, when you're

737
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:07,471
trying to learn a new thing, uh,
and, and do the, you know, pure

738
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,661
like elixir way or whatever, if
that exists.

739
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:15,360
Jono: Yeah. Um, Definitely have a
bad habit of like, how do I do

740
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,681
Ruby in X? Um, cause I'm just so
used to Ruby and Ruby and rails

741
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:24,240
and stuff. Um, but I think
they're getting into the weeds of

742
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,731
the language is really important.
So like I'm trying to like switch

743
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:29,521
our mindset to like, be more of
like, okay, how do I do this in a

744
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,521
functional language rather than
how do I do it in Ruby and then

745
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,331
transport it over.

746
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,110
Dan: Yeah.

747
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:38,536
Jono: Um, yeah, and I, and I know
like in the Elixir slack, people

748
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,445
talk about it a little bit, where
you run into a lot of issues when

749
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,175
you try and just like port over
Ruby, into Elixir, like a lot of

750
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,715
things just don't make sense and
don't work. Like anti-patterns

751
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:48,135
almost

752
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,610
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That's
interesting. Have you, uh, has

753
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,891
there been any like specific
things that you can think of that

754
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:58,550
like you approaches you can take
when like back into the Ruby

755
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,811
world from, from the new stuff?

756
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:04,981
Jono: Yeah. Um, great question. I
think the biggest thing is really

757
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:08,371
just the immutability aspect of
it. So like, you know, making

758
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:13,501
sure, like I am being really
explicit with what is changing

759
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:17,010
under the hood in Ruby has really
helped. And the Elixir

760
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,471
concurrency model is, um, I would
say like is built a little bit

761
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:25,501
differently than how Rudy's
concurrency model work. So it's

762
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:29,340
all about passing messages and
not about changing the data that.

763
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:33,346
Threads share. So kind of taking
that functionality into review as

764
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:36,315
well. Um, at least on an
architectural level has really

765
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:36,525
helped.

766
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,585
Dan: Nice. That's cool.

767
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,876
Bekah: You are, you also
mentioned you had done some iOS

768
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:44,376
development early on,

769
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:44,916
Jono: yes. Yeah.

770
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,771
Bekah: have you, how has that,
okay, so you've done it. So you

771
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:57,510
did iOS and then Ruby, and now
you're learning Elixir. So is

772
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,561
there like a pattern that you've
seen that you've worked through

773
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:06,001
those changes or as you've grown
or things that you've learned and

774
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:09,331
can apply as you learn the new
things?

775
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:16,411
Jono: Yeah. Um, well, I. Have not
touched iOS since late 2015. And

776
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:20,041
that was like on the cusp of like
Objective C switching over to

777
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:25,141
Swift. So I didn't even know what
the new IRS languages, um, so I

778
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:28,561
think like I remember early on
the way I learned was really just

779
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:32,521
about repetition. So it was like,
how many times can I run rails

780
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:36,090
new and just like, understand how
all of that works. And then I

781
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,541
remember having just so many
rails new projects with just like

782
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,335
one model in there just to kind
of. Well, because I just never

783
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:45,496
finished some projects, but also
I felt like it helped build that

784
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:48,735
muscle memory of like what a
model looks like, where it goes,

785
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:53,356
how will this fits in? And now
I've started thinking about how

786
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:56,775
can I like shorts. I taught that
because it takes a really long

787
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:59,985
time. You just doing a lot of
repetition. Um, so really

788
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:02,956
thinking about how the pieces fit
together and making those

789
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:06,106
analogies from like previous
experiences. Um, like with

790
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:10,621
Elixir, obviously Ruby doesn't
always fit, but I, how. How would

791
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,831
this look in object oriented and
what the differences are, has

792
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,731
really helped. Um, and then
finding the naming of things has

793
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,880
been really useful, both with
like onboarding, um, a new job,

794
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,251
just understanding what the
definitions are, and then also

795
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:26,101
with like learning languages,
because there's things you can

796
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,371
there's things I want to Google,
but cause I don't know the name

797
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,990
of the thing I'll be like, okay.
So question mark.in JavaScript,

798
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,221
like, which is that.

799
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:40,876
Dan: Um, yes, that syntax,
especially so hard to Google for.

800
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:45,106
Um, wait, is that, see, now I
can't even remember. Is that the

801
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:49,635
newest one or is that. the, this
is every time I, I, I, I, uh,

802
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:54,916
Yes, learning new languages is
hard learning old, keeping up to

803
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,445
date with, um, you know,
languages that you've been

804
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:59,956
writing in for a long time. It
turns out also hard sometimes.

805
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,951
Jono: Just

806
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:05,596
Dan: Right? Learning, learning is
hard, but Yeah. that idea of, um,

807
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:13,815
like learning the, the Google
language for language, um, it's,

808
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,396
I feel like a very interesting
concept and something that, um,

809
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:22,050
it's something that sort of. Uh,
the, the way that people who are

810
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,030
experienced with a language or a
concept, um, the way that they

811
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,280
Google for things is different
right. Than, than the way it's

812
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,050
somebody who's, who's learning
from scratch, you know, for

813
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,110
learning for the first time does.
And, um, I feel like that's one

814
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,135
of the things that is cool. Um,
Show in like pairing or, or, um,

815
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:41,956
streaming, uh, is those Google
searches, you know, what are the

816
00:46:41,956 --> 00:46:45,195
kinds of things I searched for?
Cause I, you know, in JavaScript

817
00:46:45,255 --> 00:46:49,056
I'm like a pretty effective
Googler, you know what I mean?

818
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:53,405
And it's not, um, and I've done
this where, uh, I have in slack,

819
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,195
you know, if somebody is asking
for help, you know, and I've

820
00:46:56,195 --> 00:46:59,610
tried to. Um, well, you know, I
find the answer pretty quickly.

821
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:03,331
Um, and then I'm like, here is
what I searched for to like, find

822
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:05,221
that, I don't know. I never know
if that's helped like that. It's,

823
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,791
it's probably not that, I mean,
seeing the process is probably

824
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,561
kind of helpful. I don't think
you can just like teach yourself

825
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,221
how to Google and JavaScript
before you, before you know it,

826
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,130
you know, I think it just comes
along with learning, but, um, it

827
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,141
is a, it is an interesting thing
that I don't think you think

828
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:22,170
about, um, often when you're,
when you're in the middle of it

829
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,916
or when you're trying to. You
know, trying to help somebody

830
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:29,505
learn, you know, things like
that. It's, uh, the, I wonder if

831
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:33,106
there's a phrase for that because
the Google language is not that

832
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:35,115
doesn't like this, right. Not
very clear, but,

833
00:47:36,065 --> 00:47:37,286
Jono: like how to Google that

834
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,106
Dan: how to Google and
JavaScript, you know, like,

835
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:39,635
Jono: Yeah.

836
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,606
Dan: um, but it is, uh, um,

837
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:44,135
Jono: Yeah.

838
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,425
Dan: I don't know. It is cool
that you mentioned that cause

839
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:50,235
it's a, you know, it is like an
important piece of of learning I

840
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:54,365
think is. Is finding out how to
find things out.

841
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,686
Jono: yeah. And it's, it's hard
to think about that sometimes as

842
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,175
well, because once you've done
it, a bunch of times, it becomes

843
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:04,896
almost like you just do it. It's
like a thing you're even thinking

844
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:08,945
about. Um, but yeah. And then
trying to explain that to someone

845
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:11,615
who's just starting, it's like,
there's a bit of a disconnect

846
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,956
that sometimes, um, it can be
really hard to explain.

847
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:17,675
Dan: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And
you know, when you're coming from

848
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:22,231
a place where you. You know,
pretty experienced with some

849
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:25,891
language, right? I, uh, you know,
I feel like it makes learning new

850
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:29,731
languages a little easier because
you have some, there is like some

851
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,581
shared vocabulary across pretty
much all programming languages.

852
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:37,291
And so if you can remember some
of them, uh, the, you know, the

853
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,681
syntax will be different, but
the, the concepts, lots of times

854
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:44,010
will be the same, but you know,
like string string interpretation

855
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:47,356
for, for instance, is, is a
thing. You know, what that means

856
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:50,626
in JavaScript is basically you
have one string and you can stick

857
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:53,476
variables inside of it. Um, I
mean, that's what it means

858
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:55,786
everywhere. Right? And JavaScript
does it one way and other

859
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:59,206
languages do a different way. But
if you Google, you know, string

860
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:02,295
interpolation, elixir, you'll
probably find the answer right

861
00:49:02,295 --> 00:49:07,271
away. And if you. But if you
can't remember that phrase, which

862
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,391
is what happens to me a lot, you
know, then it's like, Okay. uh,

863
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,451
put two strings together with
variable, you know, it looks

864
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,340
there or whatever, and that
Google search will not be as

865
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,490
good, you know? And it's it's an,
I mean, this happens to me

866
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,940
because these phrases, as you've
seen during this, uh, pocket's

867
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,581
recording these phrases,
disappear from my brain, um, very

868
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:28,090
quickly, uh, you know, and then
they come back, but. And it's

869
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,260
it's um, it's another thing
that's hard. I feel hard to when

870
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,340
you're learning, especially as a
beginner, um, that you don't

871
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,740
think about it as, you know, like
you have a power as an

872
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,231
experienced developer that you,
you know, you probably don't

873
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:41,681
realize.

874
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,221
Jono: Yeah. And it also Oak
place. Good.

875
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,016
Bekah: I was going to say, this
goes back to your point about

876
00:49:48,016 --> 00:49:51,376
communication and you know,
you're writing and that's part of

877
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:54,195
communication and learning how to
do that. But like even Googling

878
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:58,186
is part of communicating, um,
being able to speak into the

879
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:01,786
world, what you need or what you
want. Right. And so sometimes.

880
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:06,155
It's easier just to go to a group
of people. Or I know like

881
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:10,056
yesterday I was working on how do
I get a slack reminder to this

882
00:50:10,056 --> 00:50:12,425
channel every single day? And I'm
like, well, I know Marie did

883
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:15,606
that. So I'm just going to ask
her first because it's late and I

884
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:18,545
need to get right to the source.
And I know that she can point me

885
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,005
in the right direction. And she
did, she was like, this is what I

886
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:24,726
look for. And it took me right to
where I needed to be. And so

887
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:29,940
sometimes, you know, knowing who
to ask the questions to. That can

888
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,561
help you understand how to ask
them. The next time is a really

889
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:38,521
good step in communication and in
learning or, you know, writing

890
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:41,911
whatever. But all of these things
are ultimately skills that we all

891
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:42,541
need to be using.

892
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,661
Jono: yeah. Asking for help is so
hard as well. When you're first

893
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:50,630
starting. I remember I did not
ask enough questions when I was

894
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,931
signed to learn Ruby on Rails.
And I felt like there was almost

895
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,141
this like stigma of like, it felt
bad to ask questions. Like I had

896
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:00,920
to struggle with Google for a bit
before I did. Um, and yeah, it

897
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,351
just, it's a terrible way to
learn. Like, just ask someone.

898
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:04,976
Dan: Yeah,

899
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:08,911
Bekah: it is really hard. Well,
and you went to university, so

900
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,860
you had the traditional English
classroom experience. And so I'm

901
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,920
curious, cause I'm a bootcamp
grad and I learned by myself. So

902
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,101
I don't, I didn't really have
that experience of people asking

903
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:25,380
questions around me. Did, did
that happen there? Maybe I'm

904
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,960
imagining in my head what, what I
think it would be.

905
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:32,780
Jono: Yeah. Uh, yeah, I mean,
people definitely ask questions

906
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,806
and those plenty of people that
are just like, Very, I guess,

907
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:40,036
questions with answers that just
went out of my head. Um, so

908
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:44,746
there's definitely a lot of
courses in uni that I have not

909
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:50,686
found that useful in real life.
Um, so yeah, it's both. It is

910
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:53,835
like, I guess it is time of told
him that, that, um, ability to

911
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:55,275
ask the right question.

912
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:59,365
Bekah: Yeah. I mean, I guess, I
mean, it's very different being

913
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:02,655
a, being in a university where
you're expected to ask questions

914
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,976
versus like in a job, it seems
like the stakes are a little bit

915
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:10,695
steeper or something. You know, I
know that a lot of bootcamp grads

916
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:13,096
are like, yeah, I'm done with
bootcamp. Like finally, this is,

917
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:15,865
I can breathe in like No.

918
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:17,731
Jono: Please. Did you ask all the
questions?

919
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,641
Bekah: No. I mean, I didn't have
the opportunity to ask a lot of

920
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:25,811
questions, um, because it was a
self paced thing and there were

921
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,070
some opportunities for meeting
with people, but there weren't

922
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:34,090
that many, and I just didn't
really know about expectations.

923
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,681
Like, should I be working with
others, students on things? And I

924
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:41,351
don't know, as a mom of four
kids. So some people would be

925
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:43,530
like, yeah, we're getting
together for five hours. Come.

926
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:50,070
No, I can't do that. Or that's
late and I wake up early because

927
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:54,931
I've got kids. So I just never
really kind of found, I think

928
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:58,710
maybe the group of people I could
have learned from in that

929
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:04,141
situation. Um, but I mean, we, I
talk about this all the time.

930
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:07,621
I've gotten a lot better with
communicating. I don't usually

931
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:11,701
spend. Many hours on the same
problem without asking a

932
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:15,661
question. And if I do, it's only
because of my stubbornness, like

933
00:53:15,661 --> 00:53:19,530
I know I can get this, you know,
so that's, that's more of a me

934
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,581
problem, I think.

935
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,201
Dan: Okay.

936
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,371
Jono: Um, I think like you also
touched on a really great point

937
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,710
where it's like, you didn't
couldn't find the right people. I

938
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,260
think finding a community,
especially when you're like just

939
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,231
starting out that really made a
lot of difference. Um, in my

940
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,231
learning journey was finding like
the code VB community and then

941
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:39,570
getting a bit more involved with
like Ruby meetups and stuff, just

942
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,880
so I can have the people around
me to actually also ask

943
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,331
questions.

944
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:48,251
Bekah: Yeah, and I love the Ruby
community. I really thought after

945
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:51,041
boot camp, we did Ruby and rails
and I thought, well, that's what

946
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:55,391
I'm going to get a job in because
everybody was so nice. And I

947
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:59,891
liked it and I understood it and
JavaScript and react. I was like,

948
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:04,931
oh, this is awful. Um, and, and
here we are.

949
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,155
Dan: Yeah, JavaScript is awesome.

950
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:14,331
Jono: here's a thing.

951
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:15,681
Bekah: it,

952
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:21,295
Dan: I feel it, JavaScript fits
my, you know, my way of doing

953
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:25,681
things, which is. Which is, you
know, out whatever.

954
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:31,050
Bekah: I mean, I really enjoy it
now. I like to be able to.

955
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:34,815
Problem solving the ways that I'm
doing and think about things

956
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:38,476
differently. It just, I think a
lot of it was, it just took me

957
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,536
time to understand all of the
things that we're talking about,

958
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:45,885
like how to communicate it and
how to understand it. And I don't

959
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:49,815
know, people just seem less
friendly and JavaScript.

960
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,840
Jono: I think there's just a lot
more JavaScript developers and no

961
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,090
knocking javascript, javascript
is a great language to use

962
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,911
everywhere. Um, but yeah, there's
just a lot of people using it. So

963
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:01,670
you get a much wider range of
characters.

964
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:04,476
Dan: Yeah. And I think, uh, the
full stack nature of JavaScript.

965
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,666
So you can write in, you know,
Node and you can write in

966
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:09,965
whatever browser, you know, or
react to it. Everything is like

967
00:55:10,865 --> 00:55:13,536
you say, you write JavaScript and
that doesn't even mean anything

968
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:16,326
anymore. I mean, it means it
doesn't really tell you a lot of

969
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,666
information about what they're
actually doing. Whereas, you

970
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:22,005
know, if somebody is doing rails.
I can imagine pretty much what

971
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:25,846
they're doing, you know, uh, like
from on a day to day, you know,

972
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,525
uh, basis, you know what I mean?
It's like, if somebody says, oh,

973
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:32,596
I write Node, you know, okay,
that's cool. Like that means

974
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,326
you're doing some backend stuff.
Um, but maybe just, you know,

975
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:38,085
there's all those people are
writing in JavaScript as well,

976
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,976
you know? And all of the people
are writing reacts and all the

977
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:43,876
people writing Vue and just
writing vanilla JavaScript on,

978
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:49,456
you know, on simple webpages, uh,
In the same pool of people.

979
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:53,416
Right. So, um, and Java
JavaScript doesn't have like,

980
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:59,356
well, I don't know. The, you
know, Ruby started with at least,

981
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,175
uh, or rails started with, you
know, that the, this sort of

982
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,996
community lead around rails, um,
that built up as well. I know

983
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:08,206
they had some struggles recently,
but, um, I feel like that's, I

984
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:12,016
feel like, honestly, that's part
of the, um, and I'm not deep in

985
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:14,206
the Ruby community, so you can
correct me if I'm wrong, but I do

986
00:56:14,206 --> 00:56:19,215
feel like that was part of the
community. They. Back in, um,

987
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,485
when was that? 15 years ago or
something like that, uh, around

988
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:23,985
rails, you know, cause that's
when that's when I started

989
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,525
hearing about Ruby was when
rails, you know, um, got going

990
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:30,615
and, um, a lot of people just
kind of excited about the same

991
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:32,266
thing all at once, you know, in a
positive way.

992
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,735
Jono: yeah, a hundred percent.
Yeah. I mean, Yeah. Obviously

993
00:56:36,735 --> 00:56:40,126
there's definitely some topics to
be discussed around rails and the

994
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:43,306
community. But I think like a lot
of that started to, because

995
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:47,416
everyone wanted something better
than PHB. And I think it was

996
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,146
really groundbreaking at the
time. Um, and it still is like

997
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:52,096
everyone, there's still big
companies like Shopify. So you

998
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:57,045
still use as rails. Um, so yeah,
there's, I think a lot of people

999
00:56:57,045 --> 00:57:00,315
kind of wanted that change,
especially from the Ruby

1000
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:00,795
community.

1001
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:05,481
Bekah: So I going to back up
maybe a little bit, just a second

1002
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:10,070
too. So we talked about, you
know, you're doing rails and

1003
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:15,016
there's an expectation maybe of
what that looks like, but. Can

1004
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:18,016
you walk us through what that
does look like, like practically,

1005
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:23,085
like what are you doing at work?
What does your day-to-day look.

1006
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:28,501
Jono: Yeah. So I think the
day-to-day really is around. Um,

1007
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:32,280
I think it's pretty similar to
most other jobs where you take an

1008
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,291
issue and you, you pick it up.
And, um, a lot of the rail stuff

1009
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:41,521
is really just about connecting
with all our different, um,

1010
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:45,331
Components. So we have kind of
this rails engine type

1011
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:48,751
architecture. So just making sure
that and rails engine is really

1012
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:50,880
just like a library that you can
just like plug into your

1013
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,751
application. Um, so making sure
those connections work, um, and

1014
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:59,101
then using, we use graph QL a lot
Shopify. So I'm just like

1015
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:02,010
learning about that aspect too,
and how everything kind of fits

1016
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,260
together. I'm not sure if I
answered the question though,

1017
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:09,780
Bekah: Um, I think that's, that's
a good way to think about how,

1018
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:17,356
how you're approaching your day
to day and what's going on. So I

1019
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:22,215
feel like I don't want to leave
this podcast without giving you a

1020
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:25,606
huge shout out for sending me Tim
Tams,

1021
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,351
Jono: You're welcome.

1022
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:35,746
Bekah: changing experience. So
can you explain to everyone what

1023
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:36,916
a Tim Tam is?

1024
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:42,561
Jono: sure I can. They are an
Australian chocolate biscuit that

1025
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,920
is covered in chocolate. And the
two layers of the biscuit also

1026
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,541
has chocolate in between the two
layers. Um, so it's pretty

1027
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,391
amazing. And there's different
flavors in Australia where you

1028
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:57,650
can get different stuffings in
the middle. Um, you get double

1029
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,181
coat. I think I sent you a double
coat

1030
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:00,025
Bekah: did send me a double.
Okay.

1031
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:03,286
Jono: Yeah. Okay. Which is like,
Just a thick layer of chocolate.

1032
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:07,155
It's yeah. It's, uh, it's been
really good. I've been rationing

1033
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:09,885
them out as well. We've like,
we're almost out

1034
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,530
Bekah: Which I should have ration
them out. I will not tell you how

1035
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,871
many of them I ate for breakfast
every

1036
00:59:17,106 --> 00:59:17,525
Jono: Yeah.

1037
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,371
Bekah: Okay. So do you prefer the
double dip tip and Tams or the

1038
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:22,121
single

1039
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:25,835
Jono: the double K for sure um,
but

1040
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:27,280
Bekah: enjoyed the single here.

1041
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:32,010
Jono: Ooh, interesting. I just
love the more chocolate to swing

1042
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,490
one chocolate. Um, sorry, Dan.
I'll just send you something

1043
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:35,751
Dan: Yeah, no, I'm just, uh,

1044
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:37,175
Bekah: missing

1045
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,990
Dan: Tim, Tim Tam -less over
here.

1046
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:42,615
Bekah: glad there are not Tim
Tams and Kroger because

1047
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,431
Dan: sounds dangerous.

1048
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:44,925
Bekah: they are very dangerous.

1049
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,530
Jono: it was so easy and it's not
that many in a pack.

1050
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:50,516
Dan: Yeah.

1051
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:52,130
Bekah: there were not enough

1052
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:53,710
Jono: Yeah.

1053
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,041
Bekah: simultaneously asleep too
much. Do you now, do you eat your

1054
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:02,300
Tim Tams with tea? Because I
heard that's how you should do

1055
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,650
it, but I had mine with coffee.

1056
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:08,545
Jono: Yeah. Um, so I think tea's
the way you go. You probably have

1057
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:11,076
the coffee. I just not sure. I
guess coffee chocolate would be a

1058
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:14,766
pretty nice flavor combination.
Um, but there's a thing called

1059
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:19,271
the Tim Tam Slam where you bite
it, like each end of the Tim Tam

1060
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:23,070
and you like suck the tea or
coffee through the Tim-Tam like a

1061
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,800
straw and it like melts the
chocolate a little bit. And then

1062
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,780
you just like shove the whole
thing, your mouth, and you just

1063
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,271
have like a multiple and
chocolate with some crunchy

1064
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:32,911
texture and also the flavor of
the tea or coffee.

1065
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:34,041
Dan: Sounds amazing.

1066
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,090
Jono: Yeah. It's very messy.

1067
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:37,835
Bekah: I feel

1068
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:38,661
Jono: You have to find that

1069
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:41,166
Bekah: stream coming up or where
you're going to be trying out

1070
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:41,315
some

1071
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:44,405
Dan: Yeah, we gotta, we gotta, we
gotta, get some to some people

1072
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:45,666
and we'll do a group, you know?

1073
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:50,356
Bekah: wasn't like I fully
intended to save them for virtual

1074
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:54,255
coffees and have them a little
bit at a time just going to do

1075
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:54,405
it.

1076
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:57,786
Jono: that they're just too good.
Yeah. There's a balance with Tim

1077
01:00:57,786 --> 01:01:01,896
Tam slams. I've definitely waited
too long in the toughie, in the

1078
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:05,826
tea dunk and the whole Tim Tam
just like slid off and I've been

1079
01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:08,556
like, well, now I just have a
Tim-Tam in my, and that's less

1080
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:09,485
delicious.

1081
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:14,335
Dan: Oh, practice. Right. And
practice a little,

1082
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,260
Jono: Yeah, exactly.

1083
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:16,346
Bekah: I've got a practice.

1084
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,990
Jono: It's like the best practice
you could do.

1085
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:22,226
Dan: a man. That sounds really
good.

1086
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,956
Bekah: We're going to do that at
our conference. We'll do some

1087
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:26,396
Tim-Tam slams. That'll be a

1088
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,686
Dan: Yeah, can we get, uh, I
mean, we should reach out it's

1089
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,695
Tim-Tam um, sorry, a brand or, or
like a, you know, a product that

1090
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:35,326
a brand makes.

1091
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:39,860
Jono: it's a product that a brand
makes so on. It is the brand, um,

1092
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:42,235
Dan: So that's what we should
reach out to you for a sponsor.

1093
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:43,260
Jono: Exactly.

1094
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:47,695
Dan: Either get the podcast
sponsored by we'll just start it

1095
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:49,436
start every podcast episode with
the Tim Tams.

1096
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:51,626
Bekah: they don't have to give us
money. They just need to

1097
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,231
Jono: Yeah.

1098
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:53,490
Dan: Yeah, no, no, no.

1099
01:01:56,065 --> 01:01:56,425
Bekah: that's it.

1100
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,610
Jono: Oh yeah. That'd be amazing.
I could be, yeah, Tim Tams

1101
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,835
little. They also have. So, if
you take a flight back to

1102
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:09,706
Australia, they'll have like
little single pack, Tim Tams that

1103
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:12,286
they give you as like, you know,
the plane snack food. So we'll

1104
01:02:12,286 --> 01:02:14,596
have that in the VC swag bag.

1105
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:14,960
Dan: Oh

1106
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:15,695
Bekah: Yes,

1107
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:17,800
Dan: Yep.

1108
01:02:17,885 --> 01:02:18,905
Bekah: so many great ideas.

1109
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:20,521
Dan: Good.

1110
01:02:22,335 --> 01:02:26,115
Bekah: Okay. So I feel like
that's a, a really, oh man. I was

1111
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:31,396
going to punt so bad right there.
I'm not going to do it. Nope. Not

1112
01:02:31,396 --> 01:02:35,175
doing it. It's a really great way
to wrap up the podcast. I think,

1113
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:40,365
um, with something, Nope. Still
somebody stopped me from putting,

1114
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,110
Dan: need more puns on this
podcast. I'm I'm pro I'm pro pro

1115
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,041
pro pun.

1116
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,300
Bekah: I could embrace that. No.
Did you just say no?

1117
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:57,135
Dan: I did not. I, I was I'm in
favor, as I said,

1118
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,621
Bekah: Okay. All right.

1119
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:01,606
Dan: a bus just drove. I don't
know if that's what you heard.

1120
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,311
Bekah: the bus said no, the
universe has

1121
01:03:05,556 --> 01:03:07,775
Dan: I just ignore it. I just
ignore what the, what the bus

1122
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,065
says outside it's you know?

1123
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:09,190
Bekah: Yeah.

1124
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:09,786
Dan: Okay.

1125
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:13,786
Bekah: That seems like the right
thing to do. Um, anyway, thank

1126
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:17,025
you for the Tim Tams and thank
you for being on the podcast. I

1127
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:22,186

good exploration of the digital

1128
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,396
gardening and learning and
growing, and this was a lot of

1129
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:26,476
fun. So thanks for

1130
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:27,771
