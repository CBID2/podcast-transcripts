00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,268
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season five, episode six of the

2
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:16,746
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,407
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,986
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:25,417
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:28,356
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,847
you here with me. Today is my
cohost.

8
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,421
Dan: Hello, Bekah. Today, we are
talking with Andrew Bush. Andrew

9
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:40,822
is a mobile engineer specializing
in React Native. Um, and so if

10
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,301
you've been to, um, Virtual
Coffee.io recently checked out

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,951
our members page, you might have
noticed, we now have, we have all

12
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,301
of our members there and. Now we
have a little tags that say what

13
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,091
roles they have, uh, if, if
people are volunteering, helping

14
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,432
out in Virtual Coffee. And so
Andrew is one of the people that

15
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,551
has been helping out with us for
a while he's been doing, um, he's

16
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:05,352
been helping lead the monthly
challenge team, um, for the past.

17
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:08,231
I don't know how long has he
been? I'm not sure. I can't

18
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,822
remember off the top of my head
how long, but it feels like a

19
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:10,121
while.

20
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,171
Bekah: It has been a while.

21
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:12,701
Dan: yeah, it feels like to me,
it's been while,

22
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,331
Bekah: last year, for sure.

23
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:18,087
Dan: Yeah. And, um, so monthly
challenges you can read more

24
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,546
about on our site as well. Um,
but we do a different challenge

25
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:25,076
every month and, um, and yeah, so
Andrew has been helping lead that

26
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:31,406
group along with Ali and, um, who
was on the podcast season. I

27
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:34,647
don't remember which season, but
she was on, she was on, she was

28
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:37,887
on a while ago. Um, so yeah, we
talked about that for a while.

29
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:42,656
And, um, Andrew also, he kind of
talked about. You know what it's

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,266
been like leaning the leading in
the group and, uh, helping, you

31
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,177
know, facilitates challenges,
stuff like that. And, um, we'll

32
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,697
stop a while about, you know,
what it's like to be a mobile

33
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:54,266
developer. Um, some of the
experiences with React Native

34
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,846
and, uh, of course his journey
through his.

35
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:00,751
Bekah: Yeah, it was great talking
about that. And I really love

36
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,662
that the tags recognize our
members and what they're doing. I

37
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:06,781
mean, not just because we want to
recognize our members, but also

38
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,412
it helps other people to see
who's doing what and how they can

39
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:13,991
get involved in Virtual Coffee.
And we actually haven't. Get

40
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:19,301
involved section on the site. So
if anybody is out there and wants

41
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:23,171
to add a tag to their name, can
fill out one of those forms and

42
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,701
we can, um,

43
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,287
Dan: And they can get involved.

44
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:27,896
Bekah: yeah.

45
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:32,836
Dan: Yeah. Uh, yeah. So if you're
listening and you want to check

46
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,336
that out, um, it's in the
resources section

47
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:38,947
VirtualCoffee.io/resources, and
then I dunno, click through in

48
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:42,336
there. It's in there somewhere.
Um, so yeah, uh, it was a good

49
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,766
episode overall and, uh, I know
you're going to enjoy it.

50
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,752
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

51
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,211
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

52
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,961
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

53
00:02:54,961 --> 00:03:06,723
you enjoy this episode. Our intro
question is if you could live in

54
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:13,112
an animated movie, what would it
be? My name is Bekah. I am a

55
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:18,902
technical community builder from
a small town in Ohio, and I would

56
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:27,527
live in. I feel like it needs to
have some kind of magical aspect

57
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:33,858
to it, because that would be more
fun. I was going to say beauty

58
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:38,828
and the beast. Cause that's my
favorite movie. I'll just stick

59
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:39,307
with that.

60
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:46,043
Dan: Uh, pre beast conversion or
post, like, is he still The

61
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:50,723
Beast? Basically, I mean, and all
the other, you know,

62
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,902
Bekah: Yeah, there's no more
magic if he's not the

63
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,622
Dan: Right, right, That's my,
that was my question.

64
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,633
Bekah: kind of boring.

65
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,562
Dan: But if he's at The Beast,
then, you know, you got a whole

66
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:58,913
other problem to deal with.

67
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,853
Bekah: Yeah. I wonder if his fur
is soft.

68
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:06,133
Dan: You know, I actually just
watched it with the kids. Uh, you

69
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,112
know, it was their first time,
like a week or two ago. I didn't

70
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,402
watch it for a long time. Um, so
like all the furniture are his

71
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,632
servants or whatever his
household staff, well, what. Did

72
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:22,392
he not have furniture at all
before that? Or did they all turn

73
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,362
into furniture? And then they
like just threw out the existing,

74
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:26,713
alive furniture.

75
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:29,362
Bekah: furniture. I think it's
kind of got that Encanto vibe

76
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:34,793
where there's in the house. the
head of all of the cups is Mrs.

77
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:39,023
Pots, but not every cup is a
household worker. They just have

78
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,252
the magic now.

79
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:44,886
Dan: Oh, wait. So you're saying
like alive cups, but they weren't

80
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:46,475
actually people before they just
like,

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,451
Bekah: right.

82
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,725
Dan: the magic is like turning.

83
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,730
Bekah: chip, like they were
people, but there are other cups

84
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,401
that move around and do but
that's just the magic that is

85
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,331
commanding

86
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:56,815
Dan: Got it.

87
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,091
Bekah: and echanting the house.

88
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:06,076
Dan: Okay. Uh, alright. Hi, I'm
Dan. I do web development in

89
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,266
Cleveland, Ohio, and, um, I think
the first thing that popped in my

90
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:14,386
mind was Moana um, the, uh, you
know, the life there seems pretty

91
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,596
simple. Um, you know, on island
plus canoeing is one of my

92
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:22,605
favorite things and, um, That'd
be cool. Uh, Maui seems like a

93
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,656
cool hang. So I'm going with, I'm
going with Moana as my, as my

94
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:27,826
animated universe to live in.

95
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,985
Bekah: Are you taking your rain
shell with you?

96
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,305
Dan: Uh, probably I won't have to
use it very much, but you know,

97
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,406
I'm sure it rains there sometimes
there's like a rainy season,

98
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:39,735
right. I would think. Thanks for,
thanks for that.

99
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,286
Bekah: Just making sure you had
it. I know it's important to you.

100
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:50,226
Andrew: And I'm Andrew and I'm a
mobile developer in the React

101
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:57,247
Native space based out of
Wisconsin. Uh, I, I think I'd

102
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:02,857
live in the valley in Encanto,
but I have a bit of a recency

103
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:06,547
bias. I just like, that's the
most recent animated film I've

104
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:13,132
seen, but I, I. In the intro
sequence. There's these. So it's

105
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,672
in Columbia and then the intro
sequence. There's these kids who

106
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,012
like, are like running with
little cups of coffee and they're

107
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,401
shaking and the coffee splashing
out of the cups. I'd be like one

108
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,872
of those little kids. That's my
vibe.

109
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:29,807
Bekah: Yeah, Yeah, that is my. my
kids love, or my five-year-old

110
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:35,257
loves that part where. She says
Maribel Mirabelle says, that's

111
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:41,437
why coffee is for grownups. They
just laugh every single time. Um,

112
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,766
so welcome, Andrew. Thank you so
much for being here with us for

113
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:49,987
this episode of our podcast. And
we always like to get started

114
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:53,887
with the origin story of each of
our guests. So what brought you

115
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:58,416
here to the state of your Andrew
developer career?

116
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,466
Andrew: All right. I should've
expected a question like this. I

117
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:06,812
got to work on my elevator pitch
anyway. Um, Yeah, it's sort of a,

118
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,262
I don't know if there is a
traditional path, but I would say

119
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:15,791
mine is non-traditional. Uh, I,
the first time I ever wrote code

120
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:21,822
was, uh, HTML, not even like
full-blown HTML, just tags to

121
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:29,591
make my MySpace page cooler. Um,
and then like a long time later,

122
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:34,802
I thought I'd go to school for
that. And. Um, you know, that

123
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:40,172
didn't go super well, super well
for me, I, uh, my major wasn't

124
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:45,182
partying, so they kicked me out
and, uh, you know, I did, you

125
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,362
know, after sorta like, you know,
trying to figure out what I

126
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:52,591
wanted to be when I grow up for
many years, I was like, you know,

127
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,221
I actually really liked
programming and I really liked

128
00:07:56,221 --> 00:08:00,721
web development specifically. So
I. I have sort of sorted things

129
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:04,442
out. And I actually, I went back
to school again, got an

130
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,562
associates degree and thought,
all right, I just need to get a

131
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:12,091
job. I need to get into the
space. Um, and I took an

132
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:17,012
interview for like a very generic
you're going to write code, but

133
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,851
they didn't tell me what. And I
ended up writing React Native

134
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:25,052
code, uh, and I did not expect to
be in a mobile developer space.

135
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:30,422
Yeah. I actually really enjoyed
it. And that's where I've stuck

136
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,056
since then. And that's gotten me
to here.

137
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,839
Bekah: Yeah. So this is always
been fascinating to me because I

138
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,408
don't know that many React Native
developers. So can you talk a

139
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,278
little bit about how you ended up
there? Cause it's not, you know,

140
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:49,609
at least, I don't know a ton of
people doing react, native

141
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:54,889
development. First of All wait,
maybe let's pause and what is

142
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,469
React Native development. And
then answer my other question.

143
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:04,780
Andrew: All right. Yeah. So React
Native is a, cross-platform

144
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:12,221
framework, uh, for mobile apps.
They are into the web space now.

145
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:16,510
So you can write all in one, uh,
stack and then deploy wherever.

146
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,780
But yeah, the original intention
is so that you can have. A single

147
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,341
code base in single skillsets to
be able to write Android and iOS

148
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:30,461
applications because native
Android applications that are

149
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:34,780
going to be in Java or Kotlin and
native iOS, that's going to be in

150
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,360
swift. So rather than having, you
know, especially in a

151
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,421
professional environment,
distinct teams, knowing distinct

152
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,841
stacks and trying to always keep
those things in sync react.

153
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:48,416
Native is one of the solutions
that was out there. Uh, Uh, when

154
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:52,405
I first started, we started with,
uh, native scripts, which is just

155
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,525
another one of the options out
there, and then ended up pivoting

156
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,645
because of the community support
for React Native it's made by

157
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:03,596
Facebook. So there's just a lot
of support and funding behind it.

158
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:09,505
Um, but yeah, it's at its core.
It's JavaScript. Um, but

159
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,166
professionally I've always used
TypeScript on top of it.

160
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,272
Dan: That's cool. And so does
that work out? Um, from what I

161
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:21,052
understand, I've never really
worked in it from dabbling. Um,

162
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:24,841
but. From what I understand, you
have the ability to do some

163
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,851
native stuff, if you need to, or
whatever, in like real app, you

164
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:32,101
know, in non-classroom apps that
you'd like the kind of stuff

165
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,371
you're actually working on. Do
does the cross-platform thing,

166
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:39,782
like honestly, like work out
really well, uh, as opposed like,

167
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,812
or do you need to end up having
to do like little weird little

168
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,750
things for, for, you know, for
different platforms, from time to

169
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,990
time.

170
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:53,068
Andrew: Yeah, well, it, uh, in my
experience, um, which I would,

171
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,509
you know, for context, I've, I've
been doing this for, I've been

172
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:01,769
doing it professionally for about
three years. So in my experience,

173
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:07,438
rarely do we actually need to
write native code. Occasionally

174
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,489
you'll run into like, We had some
weird issue with splash screens

175
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,239
at my previous job and the
solution wasn't native solution.

176
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:20,019
But a lot of times you find, you
can just get a package, that'll

177
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,778
handle that for you. Um, but
yeah, actually most things are

178
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:31,989
pretty seamless. The, the, I
guess the overhead you get is

179
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,558
recognizing that sense. It builds
across multiple platforms. It's

180
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,369
not always gonna like, come when
it gets compiled, it's not going

181
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,408
to behave in exactly the same
way. Every time. There's always

182
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:51,249
like little corks and sometimes
it's specifically on device. So

183
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,979
we've got like, we, when, when
you write it, you frequently,

184
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:00,759
when you're devving, you're like
using a simulator or an emulator.

185
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:06,953
And, but then like before you
roll out to production, As our QA

186
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:10,403
is telling me when I'm doing dev
work to, I need to test on

187
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,854
physical device because that
uncovers more issues that you

188
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:18,504
don't see. So that's like the big
thing with it, I guess, more so

189
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,471
than, I dunno, I sort of lost the
plot there.

190
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:25,101
Dan: More so than, than different
platforms and stuff is, is really

191
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:28,432
just a, if I can understand what
you're saying, more, more of the.

192
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,312
The fact that you're working
specifically for a, you know,

193
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,741
you're building an app for it
device that somebody holds in

194
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,221
their hand. Right. And so as
opposed to something on a screen

195
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,261
with mouse or another pointer
device,

196
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:40,932
Andrew: right.

197
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,532
Dan: so yeah, that seems like
probably probably good advice and

198
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,392
probably easy to forget when
you're, when you're in the weeds,

199
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:48,437
you know, Kind of been developing
for a long time on a, on a thing.

200
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,197
And just looking at your
simulator, um, on your computer.

201
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,976
Um, I certainly like even on
websites have that same thing.

202
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,216
Right, right. I forget, uh, I
look at it, you know, I see what

203
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,096
it looks like on the iPhone, you
know, a simulator or the, that,

204
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,826
that Indev tools even, you know,
which is even another further

205
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:07,876
step removed from the actual
thing. Right. Um, but it's always

206
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,846
good to take a pass, you know,
see what it feels like, swiping

207
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,667
things or just scrolling, like
out, it looks scrolling on the,

208
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:18,197
on your. You know, for an iPhone,
at least it has the, what you

209
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,157
call the scroll that keeps going
when you, when you flick it. Um,

210
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,062
I can't remember what it's
called, but there's, there's a

211
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,922
name for it, but like on an
iPhone, when you scroll, you

212
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:28,231
know, everyone used to it, you
scroll with your finger and you

213
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:31,532
kind of flick it and it keeps
going. Right. Which is what most

214
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:35,761
people on, um, computers, you
know, are using, uh, don't have

215
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,461
that, right. They're using a
touch pad or a scroll bar,

216
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:41,522
whatever, and it stops. Right.
And that experience is a little

217
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,111
bit different. You're going to
see some, you're going to see

218
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,682
things, um, especially if you
have interaction going on, uh,

219
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,476
You know, it scroll interaction,
things like that. Um, it seems

220
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:52,427
like a pretty important step to
take. So

221
00:13:52,751 --> 00:14:00,076
Andrew: that's an actually really
interesting, uh, the. Is there

222
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:03,106
might be a specific name for it.
I'm not thinking of it either,

223
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:06,167
but like, you know, continuous
scrolling or maybe something like

224
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:10,697
that. But yeah, that is it's
interesting when developing and

225
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:18,826
it, there are certain things that
each platform will natively do on

226
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:26,417
its own. And. In my experience, I
try and create apps that are

227
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:31,336
consistent. So an iOS user, I
want them to see exactly what an

228
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:35,677
Android user sees, but you also
have to be aware of, well, what

229
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:43,037
are platform specific things that
say an iPhone user is going to

230
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:47,552
expect when they're in their
apps? Right? Navigation is one. I

231
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:51,451
phones don't have hardware
buttons for back navigation.

232
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:54,182
That's like by default, they've
got, they usually have a little

233
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:59,731
back arrow in the corner. Um, but
yeah, until that scrolling, um,

234
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:05,312
it's interesting on those types
of scrollable things in apps,

235
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:09,481
there's a really slick animation.
I think that just kinda is native

236
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:15,287
to iOS that when you get to. It
does that infinite scroll. And I

237
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,687
just think it looks really smooth
and you get to the bottom of the

238
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:21,437
list and it kind of balances
there at the bottom. And I think

239
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,856
it looks really good and that
just doesn't happen natively on

240
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,736
Android. And it's like, Hmm.

241
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:32,236
Dan: Uh, I looked it up at the
it's called momentum scrolling.

242
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,677
And, uh, I think that includes
that scroll past that exact

243
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,517
behavior you're talking about.
Um, but it, so it's because it is

244
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:42,376
cool and I've, I've like looked
at it and tried to recreate it a

245
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,197
couple of times in, in
JavaScript, whatever, but it, it

246
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,256
does have momentum just going,
it's a great name for it. Cause

247
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:51,466
it's like, it really does. You
flick it in and it starts fast

248
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,721
and goes in and slows down and
stuff like that. Um, It's

249
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,951
momentum scrolling. That's that's
what it's called.

250
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,611
Bekah: This has been a really
long week. And in my mind, I was

251
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,991
like, I want that to be my
nickname. That doesn't make any

252
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,581
sense, but like,

253
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,871
Andrew: I'd say by itself,
momentum is a pretty cool

254
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,412
nickname.

255
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,042
Dan: Yeah.

256
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:17,032
Andrew: scrolling part is sort of
weird to assign to a human.

257
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:23,147
Bekah: Um, Yeah, I'm not sure
where to go with that either. Um,

258
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:28,006
so I want to, I have some minimal
experience with React Native. And

259
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,486
so one of the questions people
ask me all the time is, well,

260
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:35,687
what's the difference? Like how
what's the learning curve. From

261
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:40,517
React to React Native, which I
actually think that React Native

262
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:45,047
is easier to learn, but I say
that as somebody who learned

263
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,537
React first, I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that,

264
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,716
Andrew. I just like, you know,
here's a view. This is, it's not

265
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,907
a diff it's a, it's a view that
makes sense.

266
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,682
Andrew: Yeah, I've gone the other
way. I wouldn't say I've learned

267
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:02,022
React so to speak. I sort of
vicariously have by doing React

268
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,301
Native, but yeah, I went the
other way. I started with React

269
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:10,721
Native and I've done some
dabbling in react. Um, I think.

270
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:16,416
Right. The, the distinct
differences I noticed one is like

271
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:21,876
in the JSX. So where you're using
traditional HTML type tags, you

272
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,636
just, you don't use those in
React Native. You use.

273
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:32,727
Traditional native tags. Um, I
remember seeing like view a

274
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:38,606
scroll view, text input, like
very these very declarative

275
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:42,326
names. I did a little bit of
development in Xamarin in

276
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:47,366
college, and that was a mobile
framework, uh, that uses like XML

277
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,376
type markup and. It had very
similar naming structure. So like

278
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:54,537
that, that stuff was super
familiar to me, but yeah, I find

279
00:17:54,537 --> 00:18:01,106
it like that's that kind of stuff
just makes sense. Um, yeah, I

280
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:10,136
think really the other sort of,
it's more of a, like a mental

281
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:14,787
contextual. Between the two, like
knowing that you're working on a

282
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:18,356
mobile device, that it receives
taps, it doesn't receive clicks.

283
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:22,106
It receives like swipes and, you
know, it's, you gotta just be

284
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:26,247
aware of the user experience is
very different. Um, I think of

285
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:33,596
like our, another member of VC,
uh, Louis, he coincidentally

286
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:40,991
joined my team. Um, and at, at
work. He had never done React

287
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:45,281
negative and he ramped up so
fast. He had React to experience

288
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:50,741
and he was instantly making
contributions. Um, so I think,

289
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,402
yeah. Want one skillset can
really help you with the.

290
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:02,162
Bekah: Yeah, I for sure. And it's
interesting because I heard

291
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:05,551
somebody talking about React
Native documentation once where

292
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:10,237
they. Said initially there was an
assumption that everybody who was

293
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:14,227
doing React Native was coming
from react. And then when they

294
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:19,567
asked for feedback, they found
that actually there were a lot of

295
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,057
non-reactive developers that were
coming in. So there were

296
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:26,616
assumptions built into the
documentation, um, about where

297
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:30,336
folks were at. And then they took
that feedback and updated things

298
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,656
and, and made it approachable
for, um, I would say more of an

299
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:40,416
entry level. Learner to navigate
through the documentation, which

300
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,797
is always fascinating to me.

301
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,067
Andrew: Yeah, I'm, I'm no
superhero. So like, I read that

302
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:51,146
those documentation, like I read
that still on a regular basis,

303
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,936
but you know, I'm not pouring
over it like I did in the

304
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:57,957
beginning, but. I would
frequently have to pop back over

305
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:01,277
to like, well, what's the React
documentation, because that has

306
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,676
like context that I need. I've
found that definitely to be true.

307
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:10,106
Um, but yeah, it was it's
interesting. I I'm coming from,

308
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:16,376
like, when I was in school, they
taught us angular, JS, whatever

309
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:20,487
the. I think it's the framework
that people don't like as much,

310
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,287
uh, the version of angular and,
uh, it's like is framework

311
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:27,926
experience. That's what I had.
But otherwise it was just

312
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:36,267
JavaScript, HTML, CSS and some
PHP. So like it really coming

313
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:40,527
into like choosing a framework,
it kind of was like, well, I know

314
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,426
Java script, so I can, I can kind
of figure this out.

315
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:49,049
Dan: I love that mentality that,
you know, Just being just like

316
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,839
the confidence to, you know, be
able to be able to know you can

317
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,000
like pick something else up, you
know, even if it's going to take

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,869
a minute, um, we were just
talking about that with Roger. I

319
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:02,430
think I didn't realize, oh,
that's podcast recording. We, um,

320
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,579
yeah, we're talking about like
learning and, and, and how that

321
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,982
that's one of those things once.
Like get some job experience, you

322
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:11,442
know, and you realize like
everybody's kind of in the same

323
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,373
boat, um, and like new big things
are become a little less scary

324
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,492
because even if it's just a big
black box, you know, that you

325
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:22,323
don't really know anything about,
uh, not like once you've, figured

326
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,863
out your way around one, one
programming, you know, I don't

327
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:28,982
language it paradigm and
whatever. Um, so many of the

328
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:32,282
things. Transfer it, somebody
that concept's transfer, you

329
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,772
know, Roger was saying, they're
like, oh, you really need to know

330
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:38,583
is like, if, and for loops, you
know, or whatever, and you can

331
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,303
pretty much get your way through
any language. Sounds like that.

332
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,673
Which I agree, which I agreed
with, you know, in, in principle,

333
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,252
it's, they're all, they're all
kind of doing a lot of the same

334
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:47,823
stuff. So.

335
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,377
Bekah: Um, I'm going to shift the
conversation just a little bit,

336
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,107
because I know you said that
you've been a developer for about

337
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:58,907
three years and that's where I've
been to. So I know for me, COVID

338
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:05,448
impacted a lot of my early job
experience, and I'm just curious

339
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,708
how, if that impacted you as
well. And I know, you know, early

340
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,518
career developers trying to find
community and then suddenly being

341
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,803
isolated. Creates extra
challenges on top of things.

342
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:26,335
Andrew: Yeah. So my. Story there
is I, I had a job at a local

343
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:36,414
company, um, and I mean,
Wisconsin cost of living. Isn't

344
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,174
very high. I mean, depending
where you live, where I live,

345
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,884
it's not, uh, therefore pay is
not very high. So I took a local

346
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:50,500
job and, uh, you know,
compensation. And, but I was

347
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,440
sticking around and because it
was my first job at the time, and

348
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,960
I just worked with that company
to get career growth. And, and

349
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,079
then the pandemic started, I was
at, I've been doing it a year and

350
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:13,170
a half, almost two years at that
point. No. I don't know what time

351
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,109
math is hard for me. there are
libraries for that. Uh, I, and

352
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,930
then the pandemic started in my
company was immediately like,

353
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:30,990
everybody go home. We're going
virtual. And I, I left the office

354
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,309
that day and didn't look back. I
didn't, I was, I was stoked to

355
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:41,444
come work from home. Because I
am, uh, I'm legally blind. So

356
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:46,904
like commuting, I just depend on
somebody else to get me to work.

357
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:55,095
That was, uh, inconvenient for my
fiance. Um, inconvenient for my

358
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:58,559
wallet. If I needed to. You know,
get like a ride share or

359
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,720
something. I mean, my work was
six miles away. Maybe somebody

360
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:09,123
can bike that every day if I'm
just not for it. Um, um, I'm

361
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:12,452
realizing I'm giving a really
long drawn out answer to

362
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:13,038
Bekah: was

363
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:19,442
Andrew: So, yeah, so then it,
and, uh, To that same point,

364
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:24,303
like, um, with my vision, it's,
it's way easier for me to get

365
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:27,633
comfortable at home. Like the
ergonomics of my setup, you know,

366
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:34,232
I have, my monitors are mounted,
so, you know, I, I have 27 inch

367
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:38,432
monitors. They're like a very
modest size, um, even maybe on

368
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:43,488
the large side and I get that.
Inches from my face, but because

369
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:46,817
they're mounted, I can have my
keyboard, like, you know, way

370
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:50,327
farther back. So I get that nice,
you know, 90 degree in my elbows,

371
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:54,258
but I can still see. And like, I
just can't do that in an office.

372
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:57,990
I can't be comfortable. Um, yeah,
so it was like really good for

373
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,628
me. And, but I quickly noticed
like, Especially when you took

374
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,888
away, like the being at work,
water cooler type stuff, you

375
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:11,068
know, spending time with
coworkers, it's like, I, I don't

376
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:17,068
like this company that much and
I'm not, I'm very alone. Um, and

377
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:24,148
so I needed a new job. I started
looking and I was just not like,

378
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,328
even with two years experience,
right. I was, I was taking

379
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:32,003
interviews and they wanted
people. With more experience than

380
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:36,564
me or, yeah, I just wasn't it,
whatever it was, they were

381
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:40,763
looking for. I wasn't it. And,
uh, I thought, well, okay. So

382
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:46,044
everybody tells me, I remember in
school and just throughout my

383
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,503
life, they're like, oh, it's
about who, you know, not what you

384
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:52,703
know, and you should do
networking. And, and I thought I

385
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:59,094
am. An introvert. So, no, thank
you. I don't do that. And I was

386
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:03,894
listening to a podcast, a tech
podcast. I can't remember which

387
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:08,784
one now, but actually you were on
it Bekah and you had talked about

388
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:12,594
Virtual Coffee and I was like,
okay, that sounds different. That

389
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,753
sounds like, you know, it's
networking. Right. But it's.

390
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:20,443
Traditionally what I think of,
and it's a community of people

391
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:26,564
doing the same thing that I'm
doing, and I need that. And I am

392
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:30,493
so glad I listened to whatever
that podcast was.

393
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,429
Bekah: Maybe the React Native
podcast.

394
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:37,583
Andrew: It's very possible. yeah,
and, and it's, it's, it's struck

395
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,128
me and I'm like, I'm going to
join this community. And I did

396
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:47,159
that and yeah, ever since, like I
joined VC, I got this like sense

397
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,959
of, uh, self-confidence that I
really needed. I think for

398
00:26:52,048 --> 00:27:00,818
finding a job outside of where I
live and, um, and, and a

399
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:06,219
community of like other people
working to better themselves.

400
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:10,094
Technically or even on
technically it's the thing I love

401
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,544
about this community too, is it's
not just about the work that we

402
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:19,723
do. Um, so that was, Virtual
Coffee. It was the launch

403
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:26,733
platform that got me to the job
that I got it actually like in

404
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:31,304
actual, tangible terms. I got my
job through a different avenue,

405
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:36,884
but I think sort of the
confidence in myself that I

406
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:46,374
gained the, you know, I, I had
like access to people who could

407
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:50,183
help me, you know, how do I, how
do I present myself at

408
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:55,574
interviews? How do I get better
at that? How do I answer? X

409
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:59,683
coding question. And that all led
me to, I think, finding success

410
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:04,513
in finding a job and finding an
equitable job, right? Like, so I

411
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:10,682
like, I, like I opened with, you
know, I was, I had a hard, I had

412
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:14,103
limited options locally, you
know, limited tech stacks,

413
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:19,682
limited pay, limited benefits,
and I was able to get a fair

414
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:23,837
compensation. By being able to
look elsewhere and being

415
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,508
confident enough to look
elsewhere and say, I am worth

416
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,228
this.

417
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:32,355
Bekah: Thanks so much for sharing
that I. Really appreciate it. I

418
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:35,536
appreciate everything that you're
doing at Virtual Coffee. And so,

419
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:39,645
you know, we're happy to have you
here no matter what, but

420
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:43,365
especially you're one of our
monthly challenge team leads. And

421
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:49,230
so I feel like. You're really,
you've really invested in the

422
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,270
community and supporting other
people to find that that feeling

423
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,871
of connectedness and community,
that seems pretty important to

424
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,810
your journey. You want to talk a
little bit about what you do as,

425
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,871
um, monthly challenge co-team
lead.

426
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:10,474
Andrew: Yeah, for sure. For me,
for me doing that, that is right.

427
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:14,045
That is my opportunity to give
back to Virtual Coffee. And in

428
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:17,734
terms of, I got so much out of
Virtual Coffee and it feels like

429
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,414
I can't give back to this
community, what it gave to me.

430
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:31,607
And I think it's, I feel, I just
feel compelled to, to like

431
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:36,317
volunteer and help, help others
get what I got, because my life,

432
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:41,988
like from before Virtual Coffee
from me sitting at my desk at

433
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:51,317
that last job to where I am
today. Oh my gosh. I, I, I have

434
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:56,923
grown so much and I'm so. Happy
with where I've ended up in a lot

435
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:59,472
of, you know, there's a lot of
influences in how that happened,

436
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:03,073
but I recognize the part that,
that Virtual Coffee played in

437
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:07,032
that. And so me doing the monthly
challenges is giving back to

438
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:12,313
that. And so, yeah, at four for
Virtual Coffee, we like, I mean,

439
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:16,992
obviously you two know this, but
we, so we do a monthly challenge

440
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:24,928
and that will consist of, we
have. 12 ish or I think a little

441
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:28,468
bit more like maybe 13 topics
that we will cover throughout the

442
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:32,518
year, uh, and assign them to a
month. And that's what we'll

443
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:37,288
focus on. And folks in the
community are free to participate

444
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:44,518
in those challenges as a way to,
you know, expand their own, uh,

445
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:50,593
skillset or as their own
opportunity for growth. So. For

446
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:58,032
this upcoming month for April, we
are doing, um, we are focusing on

447
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:06,853
jobs on the job search and job
preparation. And so like what,

448
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:12,403
what I do for that and what that
will look like, I guess is each

449
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,553
challenge looks a little bit
different, but there are some

450
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:21,232
commonalities in, so we, we like
to. Try and engage with the

451
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:26,333
community throughout the
challenge and, uh, provide

452
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:39,593
resources and basically support
for them to, to, to grow. And,

453
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:48,403
um, so. I coordinate and help,
like get the documentation and

454
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:53,893
stuff that we need set up in
order to make that magic happen.

455
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,423
Um, I, you know, I work with
people who want to be involved

456
00:31:58,423 --> 00:32:01,992
like, Hey, do you want to run
like meetings associated with

457
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:04,932
this challenge? Or do you want to
try and hype people up about this

458
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,663
challenge? Or do you want to help
me write documentation about this

459
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:10,903
challenge? So I try and rally
around that kind of stuff. Um,

460
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:16,137
Yeah, I don't do that alone.
Yeah. As, as you alluded to back,

461
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:20,847
I do that with, um, like my co
lead on that is orally and that

462
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:26,817
is so wonderful that we co lead
that together because you know,

463
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:30,807
it's a volunteer position, right.
It's we do what we can to give

464
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:36,298
back, but we also do have jobs
and families. And so sometimes we

465
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,633
can. Do as much as we'd like to,
and it's nice to have somebody

466
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,373
else there to help balance that.

467
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:45,933
Bekah: I keep hitting the mute
and unmute button, like multiple

468
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:50,554
times. I don't know what's going
on extra cookie today. Uh, sorry.

469
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:55,413
Um, yes, that is a great overview
of what our monthly challenges

470
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:59,614
are. And they've been a lot of
fun, I think, working through

471
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:03,473
them. And like you said, we've
had. I think at least 13, and

472
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:07,134
we're kind of iterating on that
the second year around trying to

473
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:10,193
figure out how things work. And,
uh, one of the great things I

474
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:14,034
love to see is how many people
are helping each other through

475
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:18,084
that process, you know, or
continuing. We had month of

476
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:21,624
pairing a couple months ago, and
somebody messaged me recently and

477
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,134
said, I really loved being able
to pair with other people and I

478
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:29,213
want to keep that going. Um, and
those are the kind of stories

479
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:35,578
that really. Um, I didn't make my
heart feel happy. I'm not sure

480
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:40,078
how else to put it because
there's this, this love of the

481
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:44,098
community that develops through
these things. And you know, for

482
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:47,818
us, we haven't made a competition
out of it. Although we have we've

483
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,598
had leaderboards and stuff, but
It's not like, oh, it's a race to

484
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:55,949
the top of the leaderboard. It's
just cool to be able to see what

485
00:33:55,949 --> 00:34:00,118
everybody's doing and how they're
doing it. And, um, I'm, I'm

486
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,568
really excited as we're going
into this second year of monthly

487
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:07,378
challenges with this team of
people to see all of the

488
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,588
connections that are continually
made and how we can keep

489
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:11,699
supporting each other.

490
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,759
Andrew: It's hard to say, like
all I want to say about it. I

491
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:20,889
getting like lost in my own
thoughts. Uh, but yes. So some of

492
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,699
the challenges that like, so we
did a, uh, writing challenge in

493
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:34,619
November where we, we support it.
Each other members in like in

494
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:38,798
writing blog posts or putting out
content and right there once like

495
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:42,278
a leaderboard individually, you
could see who put in how many

496
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,778
words, but that wasn't the
challenge. The challenge was to

497
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,128
like the number challenge was we
had a goal to hit. How many can

498
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,289
we hit this many words? I think
was it a hundred thousand?

499
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,797
Bekah: I think it ended up being
over that. Right. Did we hit the

500
00:34:56,797 --> 00:35:01,706
one 20 Dan? Do you remember?

501
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:04,717
Dan: Yeah, I just looked at it.
I'm trying to remember. I, I like

502
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,967
literally looked at it yesterday
cause I was doing this. I can

503
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:07,447
look it up real

504
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,242
Bekah: Yeah, our challenge was
like 50,000 and we

505
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:12,532
Dan: Yeah, we blast the best that
in like a week. I think

506
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:13,617
Andrew: Yeah.

507
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:18,112
Dan: I see, well, we got to 125
over 125,000. So

508
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,567
Andrew: Yeah, absolutely

509
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:21,322
Dan: it was pretty dope.

510
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,976
Andrew: And we had individual
contributors there, right. Who

511
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:29,447
they wrote a lot of words and as
amazing. And, but we also

512
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:34,487
succeeded together in crushing
that goal. And I think on another

513
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:38,447
individual basis, I think people
succeeded in just writing

514
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:43,271
something for the first time. Um,
as, as someone who runs the

515
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:47,351
challenge, I don't I've, I've
tried to balance me participating

516
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:53,202
and running it. And I just can't,
I can't do well at both. Um, but

517
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:57,641
that's, I do love supporting
that. And so right. Giving

518
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,342
somebody an avenue to do
something for the first time to

519
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:03,041
write a blog post for the first
time you see a lot of developers

520
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:07,391
do that, and if you want to do
it, it can be super intimidating.

521
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:13,722
Being on a podcast can be super
intimidating. And so when you see

522
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:16,842
other people doing it and you
have that support, you're able to

523
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:20,621
do that kind of stuff. And, but I
wanted to highlight too, like one

524
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:23,681
of the challenges, one of the
monthly challenges we did that I

525
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:30,722
really liked. Um, I think it was,
we did it for December and I, I

526
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:35,097
can't remember what we called it,
but it was about. It was about

527
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:43,166
doing like, uh, your own. What's
your passion outside of your job?

528
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:46,106
What's your passion outside of
the technical skillset you have

529
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,806
that brought you to Virtual
Coffee? Let's talk about that.

530
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:53,266
Let's celebrate that. Uh, there
was really cool stuff. Uh, in, in

531
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:57,536
music, we had people sharing
their own musical talents. I

532
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:00,777
think that was Jessica who, um,
shared some cool videos in that

533
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:07,286
we saw tons of. Uh, yarn work a
lot of knitters in VC.

534
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:10,726
Bekah: in new knitters too. Some
people just took it up. It the

535
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,257
creative community challenge.

536
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:16,197
Andrew: Yes. So right then. So
even in that, like people were

537
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:21,356
inspiring other people to pick up
new things. And I think I love

538
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:27,251
that about VC is getting to
share. That kind of stuff too. I

539
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:32,021
get to talk about programming all
day at work. Sometimes I just

540
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:36,521
want to talk to people about the
things that I like to do, like

541
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,452
for creative community. I think I
built a 3d puzzle and I had a lot

542
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:43,722
of fun and it was very Zen and
not stressful.

543
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,300
Bekah: Yeah, I think that's so
important. And I'm glad that you

544
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,010
brought that one up because it's
something that more and more I'm

545
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,204
finding that I need to do. A
break from coding things because

546
00:37:56,204 --> 00:38:00,405
it's just constant coding or
community. And I love it, but I

547
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:04,005
do find that my brain is
sometimes just exhausted and

548
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:08,804
anxious because I'm overwhelmed
with all of these things that I'm

549
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:11,894
doing and trying to learn. And
you're never gonna learn it all.

550
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:17,324
You're never going to, um, be an
expert at every single thing. And

551
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:22,349
I think that really, for me,
it's. Like, okay. I I've learned

552
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:26,550
how to do these things, but I
need to make space for, for other

553
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:32,010
things that don't feel
productive. Um, that helped me to

554
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,309
learn how to relax, which I, I,
here's a thing that some people

555
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:41,940
do. I'm still trying to figure
that one out. And, and so I think

556
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,420
it is initially Kirk's idea that
monthly challenges should have

557
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,579
four quarters and one quarter,
one month per quarter should be

558
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,630
devoted to non-tech things. And
we've even been like doing more

559
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,909
non-technical topics in Virtual
Coffee, just to say like, It was

560
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:04,800
okay. When one time we talked
about like cleaning products for

561
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,889
almost the entire time, I'm not
good at cleaning and I don't like

562
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,010
it, but I think I'm fascinated
that there are all these tools

563
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,300
out there that I don't know exist
because I avoid knowing anything

564
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,349
about it, but it was really a
great conversation like, oh,

565
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:22,409
okay. Now, now I know this adult
thing.

566
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,889
Andrew: Yeah, we are the IM
virtual. The, and in any

567
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:33,659
community you form, I think we're
all, we're all diverse people

568
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,929
with diverse interests. In the
case of Virtual Coffee, we're

569
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:42,539
brought together by one common
interest. Um, but we get to learn

570
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:47,369
from each other about all this
other stuff. And I think that's

571
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,469
one of my favorite things about
visa.

572
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:55,125
Bekah: Same same. And I, so I've
been doing a lot of research on

573
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,824
communities and community
building, and there's different

574
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:02,744
categories that communities are
often grouped into. And I kind of

575
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:07,815
love that. I don't feel like we
really fit into one category.

576
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:12,405
Yes, we are here because we're
all interested in tech. But if

577
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:15,824
you look at the conversations
among people and the connections

578
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:20,039
that are created, Most of the
deep connections are not because

579
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:23,880
we're here for tech it's because
we relate to each other on a

580
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,480
different level. And that comes
with, you know, like bringing who

581
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,110
we are and our interests outside
of tech into the conversation,

582
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:35,519
because that, that to some extent
allows for more vulnerability and

583
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:42,539
openness to happen. And I, I just
love how great that is and how

584
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,789
it's something that, that we work
hard. Kind of preserve as part of

585
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:48,480
our community.

586
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,039
Andrew: Yeah, very much. I, I
keep thinking of like all these

587
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:59,081
instances of. My interactions
with other community members. So

588
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:02,891
I keep name-dropping them. And if
that ends up being an issue, we

589
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:05,561
can just throw like a clucking
chicken sound or something over

590
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:13,601
me the names, but Kirk and I will
have a zoom calls sometimes. Like

591
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:17,291
sometimes we talk about
programming topics, but

592
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,581
oftentimes I find with him, we'll
just like wax philosophical for

593
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:26,172
an hour. And then it was like,
where did the time go? Like we

594
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:30,041
came on this call to, you know,
just chit chat and that's always

595
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:35,652
sort of where we end up, but I
love that. Like, that's why I

596
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:40,211
keep coming back, uh, is to talk
about philosophy with Kirk.

597
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:45,351
Bekah: Kirk is great. And so
this, well, once this episode

598
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,802
airs, this will have been a
couple of weeks, but we, this

599
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:52,311
week we won Most Welcoming
Developer Community. I think

600
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,382
that's it. Is that what it is?
Cause I keep saying that to

601
00:41:54,382 --> 00:42:00,626
people on live. Something,
something about welcoming in my

602
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:03,896
mind, we are definitely the most
welcoming developer community.

603
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:08,726
Um, I think we won the award for
welcoming developer community. So

604
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,117
that would make us the most right
by default because

605
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:14,197
Dan: No, I think there were the
words called the most welcoming

606
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,007
developer community.

607
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,547
Bekah: then I'm right. Okay.
Excellent.

608
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:18,516
Andrew: That

609
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,967
Bekah: where it's going with the
accident. I was just going to

610
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,467
drop that. We want it.

611
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:28,987
Andrew: well earned well-deserved
I, when I first attended a VC

612
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:35,347
meeting, I very much felt that
it, like, it felt like I

613
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:42,626
belonged. And I got into the
slack and I started like

614
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,476
messaging people. Like there
were, there was a subset of

615
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,586
people who've made me feel like I
belonged and those names will, I

616
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:53,666
think will always stick out to
me. Um, and like, these were the

617
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:57,836
people who, when I joined VC,
they were very active. They were

618
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:03,086
very present and they made me
feel a part of, um, I think very

619
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,186
much about our friend. Mike was
one of those.

620
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:14,436
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. So much, so
much of that welcoming spirit.

621
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:19,597
And it is, that is what makes a
community special and the ability

622
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:26,536
to, you know, have those. Quiet
conversations or, you know, even

623
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:30,766
just, there are tiny things that
I think are that are hard to put

624
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:35,356
into words that, you know,
somebody might remember. So, um,

625
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:40,817
I got a package in the mail for
Christmas, no name on it, and it

626
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:46,581
was a box of my favorite tea.
Where did this come on? So I ask

627
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,161
her and Kirk, Kirk knew who's
done it. It was somebody from

628
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:55,521
Virtual Coffee and it just tiny
things like, that. I mean, well,

629
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,371
sending a package, I feel like is
a big thing because that requires

630
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:02,541
a lot of energy, but the idea
that somebody remembered what my

631
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:09,021
favorite tea was. Was really
special. And there are like small

632
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:14,362
moments like that, that happen
all the time with people or

633
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:18,081
someone will remember something
that you've said a long time ago

634
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,362
and, and say something to you
about it. And it just makes you

635
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:23,512
feel like, yes, these are, these
are my friends. And when people

636
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:26,452
are like my online friends, I'm
like, no, these are my friends,

637
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:30,891
you know? Um, and so I, I for
sure get what you're, you're

638
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:31,731
saying there, Andrew.

639
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:37,306
Andrew: I think of like, One of
my big passions is running and we

640
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:42,286
have a channel in our slack
that's health and fitness. And so

641
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:46,956
I get to post about that running
there sometimes. And it's a

642
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:52,155
opportunity for me to share that,
like the friends I have who live

643
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:58,545
around me, they, they don't care
about my running. I don't think

644
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:03,195
that they're not like. Oh, look
at this runner over here. They're

645
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:07,155
done. making fun of me for doing
it or something, but they just

646
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:12,766
don't care and that's fine. Um,
but there are people at VC who I

647
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:17,865
can share that with and they
care. And it's like, it means so

648
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:23,925
much to me, like running does as,
as a hobby and a passion and to

649
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:30,690
have other people like. Get
invested to and care. It's

650
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:31,836
priceless.

651
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:35,556
Bekah: Yeah, W even, you know,
you ran a race recently, right?

652
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,746
And I, remember thinking like,
oh, I know that he's running a

653
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:40,536
race. I need to go check and see
if he posted about it and ask him

654
00:45:40,597 --> 00:45:44,496
and like that that's it. I'm not
a huge runner. I've run a couple

655
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:48,246
of five Ks, but I'm invested in
knowing how you did, because

656
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:48,996
you're my friend.

657
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:56,929
Andrew: Yeah, I, I see that like,
um, I see that with you with, um,

658
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,690
Weightlifting that you do, like
you'll, I've seen videos of you

659
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,900
doing squats and I'm like, she
can definitely squat more than I

660
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,050
can. But, because you know, I'm
not, I'm not much of a

661
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,320
weightlifter, but it's the exact
same thing, right? Where I, I

662
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,400
look at that and I'm like, I am
here for this. I am here for this

663
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,789
success. Your success makes it
feel like my success let's be

664
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:19,869
successful together.

665
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:23,302
Bekah: That's such a great way to
describe it. I feel like maybe

666
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:26,302
that's the episode title let's be
successful together. Right? It's

667
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:29,811
just all about lifting each other
up. And when times are hard,

668
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,351
especially in the last couple of
years, being able to do that is,

669
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:38,181
is, I don't know, just like
sometimes key to keeping that

670
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:40,222
momentum. I'm going back to my
nickname.

671
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,184
Andrew: th the, um, one thing I
did, I did want to. Um, talk

672
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:53,335
about kind of related to a lot of
the stuff we've said is like, one

673
00:46:53,335 --> 00:47:01,621
thing I've learned in, VC is I've
learned, I don't think I've ever

674
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:07,262
tried to put this into words. So
let me give this a shot. Like I.

675
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:16,940
I'm learning how to be myself and
be respectful to myself and allow

676
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:30,380
myself space to be a certain way.
I guess I see that, like I get, I

677
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,619
am my own worst critic. I am so
hard on myself. Um, You know, I,

678
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,760
I make one mistake and all of a
sudden I'm not good enough. And

679
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,010
you know, a lot of, some of this
plays into like imposter

680
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,775
syndrome. Type deal. Like I, my
favorite, uh, analogy for this,

681
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:51,795
and I do feel like this sometimes
is that I am two children in a

682
00:47:51,795 --> 00:47:55,005
trench coat who snuck into the
movies and I going to get caught.

683
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:59,255
One of these days. I literally
was in a work meeting a couple of

684
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:03,764
months ago. And I remember I was
talking, there was our CIO was in

685
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:08,880
the meeting and like, PI up
people. And for some reason I had

686
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,489
the floor and everybody was
listening to me and I just like

687
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:15,150
froze right in the middle of
talking. And I thought, what am I

688
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:21,719
doing here? Like, I am too much
of a child to be doing this, but,

689
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,190
um, I think other people in VC
who experienced this and have.

690
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:34,094
You know, some success some days
at overcoming it have taught me

691
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:44,025
how to, to deal with that and how
to be okay with that. Um, and one

692
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:49,304
thing I guess, in, in sort of
this similar vein, uh, that I

693
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,605
carry with me a lot and I've
carried into work is as we talk

694
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:59,639
about, uh, in our VC meetings, we
use the raise hand. Um, little

695
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:06,719
reaction on zoom. Yeah, too. So
that people can have space to say

696
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,190
what they want to say or share,
because it can be really hard to.

697
00:49:12,974 --> 00:49:16,005
To just find space in a
conversation that is a reality in

698
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:19,394
like the real world, it can be
very difficult. People have

699
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:21,914
different communication styles
and some people they're like, if

700
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:25,094
you want to say something, but it
just interrupt me. You know,

701
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:30,434
that's not me. Um, and, and I I'm
very much a listener. So if I'm

702
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:35,804
around a person who talks a lot,
they will, I'll just sit quiet.

703
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:40,835
Um, and if they don't ever give
me space to say something, I

704
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:43,925
don't say something. There is no,
uh, you can literally raise your

705
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:46,804
hand in real life. I'm not going
to too fat, but in zoom there's

706
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:50,465
that raise hand functionality,
which allows me to find space.

707
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,434
And I know I've talked a lot on
those podcasts, so it sounds

708
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:57,724
contradictory to me saying that I
do that, but I feel like this is

709
00:49:57,724 --> 00:50:03,454
somehow a unique case, but I
think. That is one of those

710
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:06,724
little things. And maybe it
wasn't little when it was thought

711
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:09,545
of, and maybe it's not isn't
little, I don't know. But it

712
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:13,715
seems like a small decision that
was made, right? It's all you do

713
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:17,405
is you press the button. Right.
But it is so big to me. And I

714
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,494
carried that to, to my work when
we have work meetings and we've

715
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:24,514
had like retros and I'm like,
Hey, there is not space for some

716
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:28,905
of our quieter members of our
team. Be themselves and to share

717
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:31,905
their thoughts and we need their
thoughts. So, you know, we use

718
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:39,405
that at work now too. And that's
a mind dump of like a sort of

719
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,494
being myself type thing that I've
learned, uh, from VCs.

720
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,619
Bekah: Oh, I love that. I, and it
is that is those tiny things that

721
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,630
make a big difference, especially
if somebody is an introvert or is

722
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,280
neurodiverse, or it's just not
really sure of what to expect

723
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:02,670
within, um, the way that things
are happening. And so having

724
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,074
those things, I know that. At
work we use, um, Google meet and

725
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:11,784
there's not a hand raise
function. And I realized how much

726
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:16,855
I love the hand raise function
now that we've been using it. So,

727
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:23,744
um, actually. It was infinite
red. I think that introduced us

728
00:51:23,744 --> 00:51:27,704
to the hand raise function
because one of their founders

729
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:31,905
wrote a blog post about it, but
it's finding those things like

730
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,965
that and then bringing them to
the community and integrating

731
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:40,034
them in to make everyone feel
welcome. That that does allow for

732
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:45,835
everyone to feel welcome. Well,
Andrew, I appreciate you being

733
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:49,135
here with us today. We're just
about out of time. Are there any

734
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:53,994
last things that you'd like to
share with our audience or, um,

735
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,795
any words of wisdom?

736
00:51:56,784 --> 00:52:03,652
Andrew: I think I've said a lot.
Um, but I guess the, the, the

737
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:07,672
closing thought to tie all the
stuff I've said together is I

738
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:14,032
just want to emphasize how much,
uh, this community, uh, is

739
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,813
valuable. And I, you know, to
those listening, you know, if

740
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:23,608
you're members of VC or potential
members of VC, You know, there is

741
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:28,918
more here than an opportunity out
of job, um, or an opportunity,

742
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:33,958
uh, at growing your technical
skills. Those things are here,

743
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,677
but there's an opportunity to be
yourself. There's an opportunity

744
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:44,518
to be around people who are like
you. And I think just don't be

745
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:49,047
afraid to, to join in all the
parts that our community has to

746
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:54,643
offer and, and, uh, You know,
share yourself. If you get

747
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:56,773
comfortable with that, it's worth
it.

748
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:01,443
Dan: I think that's awesome. Uh,
thank you Andrew so much for

749
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,702
coming on. I really appreciate
it.

750
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:04,902
