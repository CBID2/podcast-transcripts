00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,680
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season three, episode four of

2
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:12,330
the Virtual Coffee podcast.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm Bekah.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,170
And this is a podcast that
features members of the

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,370
Virtual Coffee community.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,270
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,560
stages of their coding journey.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,570
And they're here on this
podcast, sharing their

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,470
stories and what they've
learned, and we are.

10
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,674
To share it with you here with
me today is my co-host.

11
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:30,244
Dan.

12
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:31,084
Thanks

13
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:32,225
Dan: Bekah today.

14
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,265
We had a fascinating
conversation with

15
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:35,195
Joan Marie Verba.

16
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:38,644
Joan shared her long journey
with us, including her

17
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:42,155
early days in tech using Fortran
and how refusal to

18
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,435
accommodate her allergies has
prevented her from having

19
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,114
a lifelong career in tech.

20
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:49,265
She talks about pushing forward
and the importance of.

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,949
Not taking no for an

22
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:51,190
Joan: answer.

23
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,029
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast.

24
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,559
Like we start every Virtual
Coffee.

25
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,720
We introduce ourselves with our
name, where we're

26
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:02,140
from, what we do and a random
check-in question.

27
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:07,395
Today's random question is if
you could be an expert in

28
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:09,164
one thing, what would it be?

29
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:11,565
We hope you enjoy this episode.

30
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:23,054
Hi, I'm Bekah, I'm a front end
developer from

31
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,914
a small town in Ohio.

32
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:29,925
And if I could be an expert in
one thing,  can

33
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,215
I choose the human person?

34
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,405
Is that, is that acceptable?

35
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:33,914
Totally.

36
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,824
I was trying to decide if I
wanted to do like brain or

37
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:41,054
hormone, but if I can just
totally be an expert in humans.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,130
That's where I would go.

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:42,880
I think

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,640
Dan: that's, I think that's
valid and would be a very

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,690
cool thing to be an expert in.

42
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,680
Hi, I'm Dan I'm from, I don't
know a medium

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,090
sized city in Ohio.

44
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,220
from Lakewood, Ohio.

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,880
I do front end development and
yeah, if I could be an

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,470
expert in one thing, I, I think
my answer's going to be

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,000
what's like plants and stuff.

48
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,225
You know, there's, there's,
Arbery, there's

49
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,215
like Arbery botany.

50
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:08,324
Maybe that just covers
everything.

51
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:09,435
Cause I like the trees, I just
humans.

52
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:10,215
Bekah: So you can just say

53
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,634
Dan: plants.

54
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:14,415
I think I like plants  no, it's,
you know, and I've, I've

55
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,115
learned and forgotten stuff,
especially tree related,

56
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:20,025
you know, like identifying trees
based on different

57
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,365
properties and nothing like that
ever sticks in my brain.

58
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:23,545
You know, if I don't use all the
time, but.

59
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,775
We had an abust at our house to
clips and trees.

60
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:30,285
And I just made him walk around
in my yard for half an hour.

61
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,455
putting a trees and tell, making
me tell, tell me, you know,

62
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,385
what kind of tree this one is?

63
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:35,835
What's that one?

64
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,355
What's that one, which he, he,
he didn't seem to mind

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,465
too much on, it was fun.

66
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:41,685
So yes, plants, this plants is
my answer.

67
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:47,495
Joan: My name is, uh, Joan re
Verba and I'm from Minnesota

68
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,295
and I'm a front end developer.

69
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,685
And if I wanted to be an expert
in something, I

70
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,055
think I would want to be an
expert in astronomy.

71
00:02:55,595 --> 00:03:00,454
I know enough so that I did
teach astronomy at Indiana

72
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,605
university as an associate
instructor for one year,

73
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,125
but there's a lot more that I
could know and a lot more

74
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,625
that I than I'd want to know.

75
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,835
So I'd want to know even more
than I know now.

76
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:11,885
Dan: That's awesome.

77
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:12,995
Astronomy is so cool.

78
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,185
That's another one of those
things where that's my second.

79
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,385
Yeah.

80
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,705
I, it was always so interesting.

81
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:20,375
And for me, I could never keep
any of those, the details,

82
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,585
you know, in my mind, but I
always, I loved going to the

83
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,225
planetarium and, you know, I, I
took a couple astronomy classes,

84
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,665
intro classes in undergrad.

85
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,965
And actually I saw in your, I
mean, you just said it,

86
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:31,955
you were from, or you.

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,799
Was it undergrad at Indiana?

88
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,640
Or was it grad school?

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,030
No, I was

90
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,190
Joan: undergrad at the
university of Minnesota and

91
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,810
I took graduate courses at
Indiana university, but I did

92
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,100
not get a master's degree.

93
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,269
I did not reach that point.

94
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay.

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,109
Were,

96
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:47,190
Dan: were you in Bloomington?

97
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,900
Joan: Yes, I was in Bloomington,
Indiana.

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,130
Dan: I love Bloomington.

99
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,910
I, we lived there.

100
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,410
My, my wife went to grad school
there.

101
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,660
We lived there for, I don't
know, five, five or six years.

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,070
It's a great, great city.

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,359
A great, great area.

104
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,299
Bekah: Thanks so much for being
on the podcast with us today.

105
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,150
Joan, we're really excited to
hear more about your story.

106
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,609
And we always like to kick it
off with the origin

107
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,340
story, kind of how you got to
the point where you are

108
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,980
now, how you got into tech.

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,299
And so I know for you, this kind
of is a long story.

110
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,469
So if you just wanna.

111
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,539
Talk about up to the point where
you got your first job in tech.

112
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,150
Maybe we can ask some more
questions and

113
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,870
then go from there.

114
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:24,860
Joan: Okay.

115
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,400
I'll pause.

116
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,340
At that point, then I have been
interested in

117
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,680
tech for quite some time.

118
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,260
My dad was a marketing manager,
a controlled data corporation

119
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,180
in the 1960s and seventies and
eighties and up through the

120
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,320
nineties and he sold mainframe
computers to companies.

121
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,770
And when I was in high school,
the first computers

122
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,730
came out and the high school had
sort of a time share

123
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,320
with a mainframe computer.

124
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,400
And so there were some after
school activities for people

125
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,920
who were interested in computers
and I attended those.

126
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:08,895
And the way that we pro
reprogrammed them in basic, and

127
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:13,035
there was paper tape, we would
punch holes in a paper tape and

128
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:14,685
then run the paper tape through.

129
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,245
And that was the software.

130
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,435
And then we would get results.

131
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,305
Then from there from high
school, I went to college.

132
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:26,265
My freshman and sophomore year
was at the university of Chicago

133
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,065
and I had some extra credits.

134
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:32,445
So I took a computer programming
course, and that was fun

135
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,815
with the mainframe computers.

136
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,395
At that time, we were not
punching paper tape anymore.

137
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:37,755
We were PA.

138
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,195
Punching cards.

139
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:44,025
And so each line of the code had
to be on one card.

140
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,545
And so if you had a large
software program, you had

141
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,935
pretty much a long box of cards
to bring in and put through

142
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,235
the computer and then the
computer would read the cards

143
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,185
and then give out the results.

144
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
And then I went to junior and
senior year.

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,040
I transferred to the university
of Minnesota and I got my

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,280
degree in physics, but I also
took computer courses.

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,890
The reason I took computer
courses was not only because

148
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,430
I was interested in them, but
because at the time they

149
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,890
were telling us, well, you know,
you can get your degree

150
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,320
in physics or astronomy or
whatever, but there aren't

151
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,490
a lot of jobs in there.

152
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:21,510
So quite possibly you will have
a job in another area.

153
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,830
So I took computer programming
interested me.

154
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,130
So I was taking computer
programming courses after I got

155
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,280
my degree and went to graduate
school at Indiana university.

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,770
I continued to take courses.

157
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,515
When I finished at Indiana
university, I took a couple

158
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:41,715
of more graduate courses in
computer science at the

159
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,065
university of Minnesota.

160
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,885
And after that I was ready to
get a job.

161
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,615
So I applied for a job and I got
a job at, uh uny and the

162
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,915
job was in the airline division.

163
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,835
And I was in the group that was
programming flight schedules.

164
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:01,815
That's what I had at first.

165
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,545
And then the programming group
that I was in was

166
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,865
expanded to cover also hotel
reservations for the airlines.

167
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,365
By that time we were not using
cards anymore.

168
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,105
We were doing what.

169
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,700
Computer program is due.

170
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,789
Now we were keyboarding our
instructions into a computer

171
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,620
and, you know, sending it in
that way and getting

172
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,890
it compiled and bug tested and
all that sort of thing.

173
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,300
That was a lot of fun.

174
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,920
And so you asked me to stop when
I got my first job in tech and

175
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,659
that was my first job in tech.

176
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,570
That was in the late seventies,
early eighties.

177
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,440
Dan: Oh, that's.

178
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,650
My dad did just in school, a
little bit of the, of

179
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,330
the program with the cards and
the whole, you know,

180
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,409
punching holes in the cards.

181
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,960
And he always talks about, I
guess he, you know, cuz one of

182
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,239
the, one of the things that is
important is you have to keep

183
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,380
them in the right order, right?

184
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:49,919
Oh yes.

185
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,719
When you are carrying them
around and yeah.

186
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,299
And so he is at least once,
maybe more than that.

187
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:54,750
Definitely.

188
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,114
Drop the stack of cards and
still

189
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,805
Joan: what was recommended at
the time is that we take

190
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:05,335
a highlighter and on the top of
the cards draw a

191
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:10,405
diagonal line so that if the
cards ever got separated,

192
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,255
all we had to do was line them
up so that the line was

193
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:13,825
Dan: strange.

194
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,025
Oh, that's a good

195
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:15,474
Joan: idea.

196
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,325
And that, and that would, that
would mean, you know,

197
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,575
if we dropped the cards and they
got out of order, we

198
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,974
could put them back and it was
easier to do that way.

199
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,664
Bekah: What did the industry
look like for

200
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:26,685
you getting into it?

201
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:30,224
Was it something that was hard
or did you find that you

202
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:34,424
were at a disadvantage or were
there challenges that you were

203
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:34,934
Joan: facing?

204
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:37,995
I didn't find a disadvantage at
all.

205
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:42,255
There were, and you know, other
people who have studied

206
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,865
the history of tech have, have
also confirmed this.

207
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,595
There were quite a lot of women
in the computer

208
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,954
programming field at the time,
maybe about a third.

209
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,650
Of the people who were working
in the airline division

210
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,050
at uny were women had no
problems there in my group.

211
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,840
I was the only woman, but there
were lots of groups

212
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,980
in the airline division.

213
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,790
And about, I'd say about a third
of the, the, the

214
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,930
programmers were women.

215
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:12,380
It was not considered unusual to
be a woman in the field

216
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,880
doing programming at the time.

217
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,330
Bekah: And so as you moved
forward in your career,

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,860
was there a shift at all?

219
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,160
Or did you feel like the
environment started to

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,520
change or did you kind of leave
the industry before.

221
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,660
Joan: Well, I'll tell you what
happened with the industry.

222
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,590
Uh, what happened in the
industry in the eighties was

223
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,800
that, well, first of all, I
changed jobs in late 1982

224
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,930
because of the recession and my
group in the airline.

225
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,400
Was discontinued, I guess it was
given to, to somebody else,

226
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,150
but I was transferred to a
financial thing and it was asked

227
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,660
I was programming in Fortran and
I was asked to program in

228
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:02,070
Cobal and I didn't really want
to do financial programming.

229
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,930
It didn't really appeal to me in
cobalt.

230
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,520
Did not appeal to me at all.

231
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:09,635
I mean, there are some people
who say that, you know, you

232
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:12,185
ought to be able to learn any
programming language,

233
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:13,324
if you are a programmer.

234
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:14,765
And I learned a lot of 'em.

235
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:19,175
I learned many in college and
graduate school and I was

236
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,355
prepared to do anything, but I
was not prepared to do cobalt.

237
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,735
Somehow cobalt just never fit my
particular skill.

238
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,979
And as I said, though, they say
that you can learn any

239
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:33,890
programming language cobalt just
never made sense to

240
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,800
me in any way whatsoever.

241
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,750
So I went to Republic airlines
because I was used

242
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,250
to doing airline programming.

243
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,839
They programmed in.

244
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:49,305
I'm blanking out on the term,
but it was the, the very

245
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:52,365
basic programming language that
we, that we had.

246
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,915
So I was, I was in another
programming language.

247
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:55,575
That was fine.

248
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,925
I learned it fine that didn't
work out for various reasons.

249
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:04,695
And so I sort of bounced around
from job to job until I got to

250
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:07,155
a, uh, tech startup in 1980.

251
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,550
And this is where the
environment changed, but

252
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,020
probably not in the way that you
think, because by that time,

253
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:23,130
Steve jobs and apple were, were
trying to revolutionize the

254
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,569
computer industry and do things
differently and have a different

255
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,130
work environment and have a.

256
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,229
Working philosophy.

257
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,020
Now I have food allergies up
until Steve jobs started

258
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,349
introducing all of these
innovations at the workplace.

259
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,969
Food was forbidden.

260
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,084
You were not to have food.

261
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:50,535
Definitely not to have food in
the places where you were

262
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,265
doing keyboarding, because it
was felt the chromes

263
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,935
would mess up the computers,
mess up the keyboards,

264
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:56,805
mess up the computers.

265
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,454
You weren't supposed to have
food anywhere

266
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:00,104
at all at your desk.

267
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,875
They might look the other way.

268
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,925
They looked the other way.

269
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,474
Cuz I had tea, you know, I
brought a Thermo of tea.

270
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,545
I, I was looked the other way,
but otherwise you're

271
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:08,444
supposed to eat in the lunch.

272
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,954
You were not supposed to eat in
the computer areas at all,

273
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:17,324
but when Steve jobs started
doing things, one of the things

274
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:20,985
that he started doing was
introducing the fact that you

275
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,305
had food all over the place.

276
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,625
You had free food for everybody
at the workplace, and you

277
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,885
could have food everywhere.

278
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,265
And there was food everywhere.

279
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:33,704
And by the time I got to this
startup in 1987, there was food.

280
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:33,915
Every.

281
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,959
And this was a problem for me,
you know, I'm definitely

282
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:38,920
allergic to peanuts.

283
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,290
They were eating peanuts at the
keyboards where I was

284
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,989
supposed to do programming and I
got definitely ill.

285
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,120
My lung capacity dropped by
half.

286
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,489
I had to go see a doctor.

287
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:49,930
I was ill for an entire year.

288
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,339
I had to quit the job because I
simply just to recover.

289
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,790
I, I simply could not work there
anymore.

290
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:02,410
And that was a big change for
me.

291
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:08,825
After that I wanted to get back
into programming, but the

292
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:13,745
personal computer, the mainframe
was going out of phase.

293
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:19,355
And the startup that I had
worked for in 1987, went out

294
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:23,285
of business a couple of months
after I quit, because they

295
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,835
were into mainframes and nobody
wanted mainframes anymore.

296
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:29,265
Everybody wanted personal
computers.

297
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:33,855
And I did not have the
instruction to program personal

298
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,095
computers and I was broke.

299
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:38,565
I didn't have a job.

300
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,925
I had moved back with my parents
and I was ill.

301
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,230
And so I, I couldn't afford to
go back to college and learn

302
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,310
the new PC programming skills.

303
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,210
So I went to other jobs, worked
for a publishing company,

304
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,960
trained as an editor, got into
publishing a little bit.

305
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,604
After that I worked as an editor
for about 15 years,

306
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:05,234
and then I, I also worked for
another company more or

307
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,375
less in customer service.

308
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:11,505
And then in 2015, I learned
about coding boot camps.

309
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,905
And I had never heard about
coding boot camps before,

310
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,584
but someone was starting a
coding boot camp locally.

311
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:24,335
And I thought, okay, maybe I can
retrain to do this because

312
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:29,615
I had learned basic HTML by
myself in the late nineties

313
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,415
to build my own websites.

314
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:34,325
And I knew enough to build a
website, but you know,

315
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:37,685
nothing that would suit me for a
job, but the, the

316
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:41,135
recruiting boot camps and the
person who started the coding

317
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:45,125
boot camp was interviewed by the
local press and said

318
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,655
that the reason why he was.

319
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:50,795
A a coding bootcamp was that
there were so many jobs

320
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:54,035
in web development open, and
there weren't enough

321
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,415
trained people to fill them.

322
00:14:55,985 --> 00:15:02,165
And I thought, okay, I should be
able to learn coding fairly

323
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:06,125
easily because of my computer
programming background, the

324
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:10,655
bootcamp is not terribly
expensive and I, and it

325
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:12,845
would be like 16 to 20 weeks.

326
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,965
And then I would go to a job and
then I could get hired.

327
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,550
Well, okay.

328
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,800
So I applied for this bootcamp
in 2015, and it was

329
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,350
pretty difficult to get in.

330
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,990
I had to have two interviews.

331
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,740
I had to take some free coding
classes to prove

332
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,939
that I could code.

333
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,829
I had to prove that I was, had
an aptitude for coding, and

334
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:43,060
then I applied for a scholarship
and I had to pass a number.

335
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,610
Various tests to get the
scholarship, but I finally

336
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,940
got accepted and I finally got
the scholarship and the

337
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,520
coding boot camp for me was
supposed to start at the

338
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,780
end of August a couple of weeks
before the coding boot

339
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,890
camp was supposed to start.

340
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,360
And I, and I got the
scholarship.

341
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,500
I, um, called the person who was
in charge of the coding school.

342
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,270
And I said, okay, I need
accommodations.

343
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,410
I have food allergies.

344
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,330
I would like there not to be
food in.

345
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,219
School room in the classroom.

346
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,020
If you have food elsewhere,
fine.

347
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,719
I'll avoid those areas, but I
can't avoid the classroom.

348
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,370
So there has to be no food in
the classroom.

349
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,189
Well, the guy sort of went
ballistic and we had a half

350
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:28,079
hour conversation in which he
was just apoplectic.

351
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,949
And, and I was trying to explain
this, this really

352
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,890
isn't a big deal, but he was
still apoplectic.

353
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,420
I said, look, let me go to your.

354
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:37,875
Location.

355
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,845
And, you know, I'll be able to
tell pretty easily if, if

356
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,105
it's suitable for me or not.

357
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,955
And so I did go to the location
a couple of days

358
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:47,895
after that and looked around and
I said, look, you know,

359
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,095
this looks pretty good.

360
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,285
All you have to do is, is make
sure that there's

361
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:52,335
no food in the classroom.

362
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,415
And I think I'll be okay.

363
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:57,705
But no, a couple days later I
received an email

364
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:00,645
from him saying that my
enrollment had been canceled.

365
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,545
My scholarship had been cancel.

366
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:08,295
And in addition to that, I was
totally unsuitable to be

367
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,464
a student at a code school.

368
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:10,635
Jeez.

369
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,580
Okay.

370
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,950
Not to be deterred.

371
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,760
wait, can we just pause for a
minute here?

372
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,320
There, this is a good place to
pause.

373
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,060
Bekah: I just feel like we've
covered a

374
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,050
couple of decades here.

375
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,560
So I wanna, I wanna jump back to
like your first experience

376
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,440
with that, because you talked
about these environmental

377
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:31,110
changes and it's a lot of things
that one, I don't think

378
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,450
people really think about.

379
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,995
Dealing with challenges that
they're not faced on a day

380
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,855
to day basis all the time.

381
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:43,795
And so when you had to quit that
first job at the startup, did

382
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:47,305
you talk to your employer about
the situation with the food?

383
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,570
Joan: Oh, there were a number of
conversations.

384
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:57,659
My doctor wrote a two page
letter to them explaining

385
00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:00,600
my food allergies and that I
couldn't be around nuts

386
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,709
and I needed the Nury area and
all this sort of thing.

387
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,459
And they finally got down to
saying, we're going to offer

388
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,350
you a nut free area, your desk.

389
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:18,705
Mm-hmm  and that really was not
sufficient  yeah, it

390
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:19,755
was, it was not sufficient.

391
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:23,085
So I really had to quit because
they said, you know,

392
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:24,285
it's it's this or nothing.

393
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,545
So I quit.

394
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,555
But there were a number of
conversations.

395
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,505
I had conversations with my
supervisor.

396
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,065
I had a conversation with HR.

397
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,255
The doctors had conversations
with them.

398
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,355
The doctors wrote letters, you
know, stuff like that.

399
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:35,505
It.

400
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,659
It didn't, we weren't able to,
to reach an agreement where I

401
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,040
thought that I would be safe.

402
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,439
So I, I simply quit.

403
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,139
And I was, I was so ill by the
time I quit.

404
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:48,510
Anyway, as I said, my lung
capacity dropped to

405
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,030
half and it stayed that way for
quite some time.

406
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,850
It took me about a year to
recover from that.

407
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:59,939
So it was, it was a really
traumatic experience for.

408
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:00,945
Oh, for

409
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:01,365
Bekah: sure.

410
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:04,545
And then the, the traumas
relived, I think when you

411
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,605
were trying to enter that
bootcamp in the middle, when

412
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,545
you were working as an editor
and the other things you were

413
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,615
doing, were they accommodating

414
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,065
Joan: to you?

415
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:19,845
The editing job was ahead of its
time because it was remote work.

416
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:23,745
There wasn't really a lot of
remote work at that time.

417
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,645
That was legitimate.

418
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,585
This was legitimate, remote
work.

419
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:30,195
All I had to do, I, I worked at
home.

420
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,665
They wanted you to work at home.

421
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:35,835
It cut their overhead expenses,
tremendously for their

422
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:37,065
employees to work at home.

423
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:41,775
All the editors worked at home
and all I had to do was to.

424
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,510
Just go to the pickup area and
pick up my

425
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,800
assignments in the morning.

426
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,610
And then the next day I would
drop off my assignments

427
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,980
from the day before and pick up
my new assignments.

428
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,389
So it really, there really was
very minimal contact there.

429
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,820
And so I worked at home where I
was comfortable.

430
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,720
The other job that I had did
accommodate me.

431
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:03,815
But them.

432
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:05,945
And remember I said, I worked
for a publishing

433
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,355
company too, for a while.

434
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:11,555
They in the publishing company
did accommodate me, but there

435
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:17,255
was an overall feeling that they
felt it was a nuisance.

436
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:22,005
And that I was a nuisance and
that they really would

437
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:26,565
rather not do this, but they
sort of had to, because I

438
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:30,045
had to be accommodated and they
sort of had to fill,

439
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:33,555
fulfill the employment law about
accom because the

440
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,505
ADA had not been passed.

441
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:38,895
When I lost my job in 1987, it
had been by the time I'd

442
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,005
gotten these other jobs.

443
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:43,425
And so they accommodated me, but
it was not a comfortable

444
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,775
situation in either of those.

445
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,460
Bekah: Okay, so you left tech
and in this very traumatic

446
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:57,330
experience and then 20 ish years
later, decide to try tech again.

447
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:01,650
And so I wonder, like what kind
of inspired you to try for

448
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,570
this again, after having such a
bad experience in tech prior.

449
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,514
Joan: I guess I was desperate at
the time that that I

450
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:14,355
enrolled in the bootcamp, I had
lost my previous jobs.

451
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:19,335
The editing job came to an end
and I was told that I

452
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:20,895
was not eligible for rehire.

453
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:22,185
I won't go into the reasons.

454
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,475
And then the other job, again,
as I said, the accommodation

455
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:27,855
was very reluctant.

456
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,660
And I felt unwelcome.

457
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,240
I just felt that the, the time
had come for

458
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,170
that job to end too.

459
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,260
So I didn't have any work and I
felt that I could,

460
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,440
and I thought, you know, if
there's such a demand for

461
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:44,670
web developers, good, because
this is a job that I can do.

462
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,890
All I need is the instruction on
the latest techniques.

463
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,504
Bekah: So then you're back in
this situation again, right.

464
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:55,564
And you've kind of are reliving
this trauma in a

465
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,615
new way and you are stuck
because what you thought was

466
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:02,284
going to happen, just got.

467
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,755
Totally taken away from you.

468
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,105
And then you decided you were
gonna keep going forward, right?

469
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:09,705
That

470
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,305
Joan: is correct.

471
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:11,325
Shall I go on?

472
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,815
Yeah, I wanna know do that.

473
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:17,175
Bekah: You still are looking for
those jobs.

474
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,455
That was still the inspiration
here.

475
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:22,185
Joan: I still felt that a coding
boot camp was the way to go.

476
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:26,355
So I kept on researching coding,
boot camps to see if there was

477
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:30,794
one nearby or one that I could
take remotely or whatever.

478
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:35,774
And so at the end of 2015, I
discovered that there

479
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:39,254
was a boot camp network called
the iron yard.

480
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,040
That was all over the country,
but was just planning to

481
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,990
get started in Minneapolis.

482
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,929
And I thought, okay, let's get
on in, on the

483
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:49,010
ground level on that.

484
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,730
So I did.

485
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,169
So I went and I went to the, get
acquainted meetings,

486
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:58,100
get acquainted with the iron
yard meetings and I applied.

487
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,740
And again, I took another
bootcamp later, but

488
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,750
we'll get into that, but it
seems that that the

489
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,120
bootcamps have a, um, long.

490
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,020
Intake process by which they
want to make sure that you

491
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,440
have the aptitude to do code and
that you have at least

492
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,180
the enthusiasm to do code.

493
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,620
So there was a long process by
which I had to

494
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,310
meet these requirements and I
did fairly easily.

495
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,520
And so I was accepted into the
iron yard.

496
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,850
In early 2016.

497
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,800
And again, I waited until the
last minute and I

498
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,840
said, I want to meet with the
campus director.

499
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,110
And I met with the campus
director and I told the campus

500
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,460
director of the iron yard.

501
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:42,110
I have food allergies.

502
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,920
And I need accommodation.

503
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,400
And as soon as those words are
out, we're out, the campus

504
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,310
director said, okay, here is
what we're going to do for you.

505
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,610
We are going to have no food in
the classroom.

506
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,310
We are going to notify all the
students.

507
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,710
They are not to bring any food
into the classroom.

508
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,330
They're not to bring any food in
any of their backpacks.

509
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,750
They're only to eat in a, in
designated areas,

510
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,250
outside the classroom.

511
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,610
And she said, and if you have
any trouble with that or

512
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,850
have any problems whatsoever,
you come and talk to me.

513
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:17,595
That was very different than my
previous studio.

514
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:17,804
That sounds

515
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:18,274
Dan: better

516
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,165
. Joan: So I did go to the iron
yard and the conditions were, as

517
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:27,794
they said, and again, the campus
director and the instructor

518
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:30,105
said, you know, we are where you
have food allergies.

519
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:32,235
If you have any problems, you,
you, you come to us.

520
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:35,774
I never had any problems because
the students were very diligent.

521
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,530
About observing the rules and
that was fine and

522
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,300
they didn't seem to have any
problems with it.

523
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,960
That was great.

524
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,990
So I started the, the iron yard
in June and

525
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:46,520
graduated in September.

526
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,180
Then I started applying for jobs
and they had, you know,

527
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,660
the part of the program was job
coaching and all this sort

528
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,530
of thing, which was great.

529
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:59,605
And then I did apply for a job
at, at a certain company.

530
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:00,475
I won't name it.

531
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:03,055
I, I applied for a job at a
certain company.

532
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,815
They said it was a front end
development job.

533
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,365
Mine was, I just got a
certificate in

534
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:09,205
front end development.

535
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:09,865
Wonderful.

536
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:10,855
Let's go for it.

537
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:14,185
All of the intake was remote.

538
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,665
Every single bit of the intake
was remote.

539
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:22,125
I did not see a single employee
face to face until my first

540
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,355
official day at the job.

541
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:28,064
Everything was remote and the
induction process was long.

542
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,264
It was a couple of months.

543
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,355
They did a thorough background
check and I had to pass

544
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,155
the background check, which I
did, but then again,

545
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:37,395
that took a month and then
finally they gave me an.

546
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,520
I accepted the offer.

547
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,550
I signed the employment
contract, and then only

548
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,429
after that, I said, I need
accommodation

549
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:46,510
for my food allergies.

550
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,379
So I was put in touch with the
executive.

551
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,710
This, this is a big
multinational company and

552
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,710
I was put in touch with the
executive in charge of

553
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,090
employees with disabilities.

554
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,070
And she said, okay, to
accommodate you.

555
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,209
We have to have a doctor's note.

556
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,260
We have a certain form.

557
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,020
You can have the doctor fill out
and fax it back to us.

558
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,250
That's fine.

559
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,419
They emailed me the form.

560
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:09,350
I printed it out.

561
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,560
Fortunately, my doctor had an
appointment on the same day.

562
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,139
I went to the doctor, she filled
out the form.

563
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,449
She, she faxed it in.

564
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,990
I faxed it in  to, to make sure
that they got it.

565
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,870
I also scanned it and emailed it
to make sure that they got it.

566
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:25,340
They told me that they got.

567
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,685
That the accommodations were
there.

568
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,635
They were going to have signs
up.

569
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:33,145
They were going to, to put me in
the place that was the

570
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:36,805
most remote op the most remote
desk from the lunchroom.

571
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,945
That's what they promised me.

572
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:40,705
They said there would be signs
up for people to, to say,

573
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,645
there's someone with food
allergies here, please confine

574
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:47,305
your food to the lunchroom areas
and don't bring any nuts

575
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,635
and peanuts into the, into the
AR in the work areas at all.

576
00:26:50,905 --> 00:26:52,585
They said, this was all going to
happen.

577
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:57,814
So I went there and I had a
week's orientation at

578
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:01,445
the headquarters, which, which
was fine and the

579
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,975
environment was okay.

580
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:05,135
And they did pay attention to my
allergies though.

581
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,725
I had to remind them a couple of
times.

582
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:10,834
And then I got to the first day
on the site of the job where I

583
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,584
was going to be at and welcome.

584
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:15,604
Got my badge.

585
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,370
Showing my desk.

586
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,330
Okay.

587
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,170
First thing I do is of course I
wash off the desk in case

588
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,630
the, the previous occupant had
crumbs or anything.

589
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,750
So I'm washing off the desk and
my supervisor comes up to me and

590
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,800
says, oh, I need to, to inform
you that we share desks here.

591
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,090
And I said that, well, that's
fine.

592
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:36,120
But the person who is sharing my
desk will have to be very

593
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,060
diligent because I have food
allergies and can't have

594
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,170
nuts and peanuts in the area.

595
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,110
And he said, oh, no one told me
about that.

596
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:46,275
And also there were no signs up.

597
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:49,425
And also my desk was not the
farthest one

598
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,385
away from the lunchroom.

599
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:51,465
Wow.

600
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:53,895
Bekah: So all of the
accommodations

601
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,565
Joan: that did not happen.

602
00:27:56,565 --> 00:28:00,855
And then a week later, my
supervisor asked me to come

603
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,345
into a conference room and meet
with me privately.

604
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:04,845
So I meet with him privately.

605
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,825
And he said you can't work.

606
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:13,574
So basically I was sent home to
await an assignment.

607
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:15,975
I waited for a year.

608
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:19,215
They did not have an assignment
for me that they felt that

609
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:21,955
they could put me into, and then
they laid me off.

610
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,810
Dan: Ah,  so they sent you home
just because they didn't

611
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,400
wanna deal with accommodating

612
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
Joan: you or they didn't wanna
deal with the food

613
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,710
allergies situation.

614
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:31,950
No.

615
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:32,850
Gosh.

616
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,240
Is that what

617
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,990
Bekah: they said?

618
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,980
What was the,

619
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,860
Joan: the reason, the reason was
the food allergies.

620
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,879
Oh wow.

621
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,890
They said you, you, you can't
work here.

622
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:43,830
We have food all over the place
all the time we were, and we're

623
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,270
not, that's not gonna change.

624
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,450
Bekah: And you know, the thing
here too, is.

625
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:50,415
First of all.

626
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,835
I'm sorry, this is something
that you should never

627
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,395
have to go through at all.

628
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:55,995
Let alone.

629
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,050
Over a period of many years to
have to push

630
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,010
through these challenges.

631
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,400
But also, you know, I've heard
other people who need

632
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,670
accommodations for health
reasons who have experienced

633
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,090
the same thing where they've
been told, well, go home

634
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,460
and then we'll contact you when
we have an assignment.

635
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,580
And then there's never an
assignment for them.

636
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,580
And it is just, I wanna say a
shame, but it's, it's,

637
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,080
it's, it's terrible, right?

638
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,310
It's way worse than a shame.

639
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:26,925
It's not okay at the very least,
you know?

640
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:28,034
Okay.

641
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:33,675
So now you've navigated through
yet another challenge and

642
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:35,804
somehow not given up hope.

643
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:36,375
Right.

644
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,135
And where does that take you
next

645
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:43,034
Joan: about the time that I got
laid off, the university

646
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:46,574
of Minnesota was offering.

647
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,330
A bootcamp locally and the price
was right.

648
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,310
So I enrolled in their full
stack bootcamp thinking

649
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:58,770
that, you know, I have front end
development experience.

650
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,190
If I get full stack experience,
that will expand the number

651
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,930
of jobs I'm able to apply to.

652
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,350
So I enrolled in that bootcamp.

653
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,985
They did accommodate me.

654
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,865
I did have to remind them a few
times, but you know, they did

655
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,325
accommodate me and I graduated.

656
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:19,225
I started that in, uh, March of
2018, about the

657
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:20,515
time that I was laid off.

658
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:24,745
And then that wa that ended at
the end of July in 2018.

659
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:30,325
So I graduated from that and all
the time that I was going

660
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:32,875
through the bootcamp and
learning through the bootcamp,

661
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,065
I was also looking for work.

662
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,630
All the time.

663
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,180
And I have been looking for work
ever since I was

664
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,930
laid off in March of 2018.

665
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,200
And I have kept track of the
number of jobs that I have

666
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,030
been applying to because I was
sort of curious as to how

667
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,750
many jobs or how long that I
would have to apply before

668
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,630
I got a job this morning.

669
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,590
I filled out my 532nd job
application.

670
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,970
That's how many jobs that I have
applied to since I was laid off.

671
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,620
So I am still applying for jobs.

672
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,870
I have done some freelance work.

673
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,330
In between, but when the
pandemic came last year,

674
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,220
those dried up pretty quickly.

675
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,380
So I didn't even have any
freelance work to do so that's

676
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,570
pretty much where I am now.

677
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,210
I am still applying for jobs.

678
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,405
Still hoping that someone will
hire me.

679
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:46,575
I don't know if you want me to
go on the podcast

680
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:50,655
and relate my terrible
experience of last month.

681
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,345
which you heard about at the
Virtual Coffee?

682
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:55,754
I can, if you wish.

683
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,220
Bekah: I think that's really a
part of your story and

684
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,750
you face so many challenges.

685
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,180
And so if that's something
you're willing to share,

686
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,760
I would love for you to talk
about that too.

687
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,090
I am

688
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,940
Joan: certainly willing to share
this because I was told

689
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:11,000
when I made the call and I'll
get into that in a moment that

690
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,760
this was a very common scam that
people who are applying

691
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:19,790
for check jobs, run into.

692
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,170
So.

693
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:28,094
At my 521st application, I got a
note saying that they wanted to

694
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,074
interview me, which was great.

695
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,145
I mean, I've, I've been on your
interviews.

696
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:35,445
Haven't gotten hired, but I've
got, I've had some interviews.

697
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:39,465
So they, they asked me to
interview and I

698
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:40,784
responded to the interview.

699
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:43,334
It was a set of written
questions, written interview

700
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:46,064
questions that they asked me to
return and I returned them.

701
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:50,215
And then, then after I returned
them, you know,

702
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,225
there was an interview and then
they said I was hired

703
00:32:52,675 --> 00:32:53,785
and I was just thrilled.

704
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,435
I thought I, I was hired now
this, this job was posted on

705
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:02,365
Glassdoor, which is a reputable
place for posting jobs.

706
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,520
The name of the company was
genuine.

707
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,000
They took the name of a company
of a genuine company in Austin.

708
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,190
Texas gave me the genuine name
and address the employment

709
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,140
contract, which they gave me was
a standard tech

710
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,020
employment contract, looked like
any other tech employment

711
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,520
contract that I had signed.

712
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,070
I signed it and sent it back to
them.

713
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,880
By email, all this remote stuff
was not unusual because I had

714
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,940
gone through this with this
other company where everything

715
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,500
in the onboarding was remote.

716
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,590
The email address looked like.

717
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,795
The email that would be from the
HR, from this company, uh, no

718
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,055
trouble with the email address.

719
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,995
Although the person that was
supposedly my supervisor had

720
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:51,045
a non-company email, but you
know that I've had freelance

721
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,425
jobs where that's happened too.

722
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:56,055
So that, that didn't raise any,
any alarms with me.

723
00:33:57,075 --> 00:34:01,125
So I thought, oh my goodness, I
am finally hired.

724
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:01,755
Wonderful.

725
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:03,285
I've got an employment contract.

726
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:04,185
They said fine.

727
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,315
And it's for a remote job.

728
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:07,035
Great.

729
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:08,895
That's what I need a remote job.

730
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:11,175
And they said, you've gotta set
up a home office.

731
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:11,865
Fine.

732
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:12,915
That's that's great.

733
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:17,205
And we want you to use company
equipment that you buy from

734
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:18,764
our designated supplier.

735
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:20,565
That's not unusual either.

736
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:24,135
So they said we will send you a
check.

737
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,020
And you will use that check to
buy the equipment

738
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,040
for your home office.

739
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,030
Fine.

740
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,020
So they sent me the check and it
came through the

741
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,910
post by priority mail.

742
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,610
It looked like a priority mail
envelope, but the

743
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,770
address, the name and address on
the check was not

744
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:41,610
the one of the companies.

745
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,295
So I emailed the person that was
supposed to be my supervisor.

746
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:49,405
I said, this check is not from
your company.

747
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:51,655
And he says, oh, that's one of
our trust vendors.

748
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,315
Don't worry about it.

749
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:52,915
It's a good check.

750
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,054
I said, okay.

751
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,855
But I also looked at the address
on the envelope and the address

752
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:01,855
on the envelope did not match
the address on the check.

753
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,565
Which did not add none.

754
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,845
Neither of them matched the
address from the company.

755
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,615
And I looked up on Google maps,
the address, the return

756
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:13,525
address on the envelope, and it
was a vacant lot.

757
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:18,535
And so my supervisor was, was
saying, my supposed supervisor

758
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,205
was saying, okay, we want you to
take the check to the bank.

759
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:24,475
We want you to email the
receipt, the deposit receipt

760
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:27,385
to us so that we know that
you've deposited the check.

761
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:28,675
I said fine.

762
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:31,075
So I went to the bank and I said
to the banker, I.

763
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:35,745
I've been told trust, but verify
there's, there's something about

764
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:38,025
this check that I questioned.

765
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:40,485
So what I would like you to do,
this was on a Friday.

766
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:44,535
I said, what I'd like you to do
is call the bank and see if

767
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,505
it's a legitimate account and
that the funds are available.

768
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,250
And they said, well, this is
Friday after three o'clock and

769
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,210
it was so, so we really don't
expect a response until Monday.

770
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,440
I said, that's fine.

771
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,490
So on Saturday my supposed
supervisor gets back to

772
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,290
me and he says, has the check
been deposited?

773
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,010
I said, yes.

774
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,720
And I scanned the receipt and
emailed it.

775
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,640
Did not have my full bank
account number

776
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:07,450
on it, those seats.

777
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,950
So like felt safe in that.

778
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,850
So he says, well, we want you to
get started right away.

779
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,440
So we want you to buy the
equipment right away.

780
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,980
I said, fine.

781
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,560
He says, I'll put you in touch
with our supplier.

782
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,130
Fine.

783
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,160
So it was a text message
conversation.

784
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,180
So the text message says, I am
George or whatever from a

785
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,860
one computer supply company.

786
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,690
And, uh, we want to deliver the
equipment to you by 5:00 PM, but

787
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,190
we want you to pay for it first.

788
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,620
And we want you to withdraw the
money in cash from

789
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,590
your bank, and then deposit it
into our bank.

790
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:43,924
I said, okay, now I had checked
my bank account

791
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:47,404
thing and it looked as if the
check had gone through.

792
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:48,964
So I thought, okay.

793
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,484
It looks like the check has gone
through, so I.

794
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,570
I drove to the bank and I said,
remember that check.

795
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,890
I want to withdraw it.

796
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:57,450
She says, you, you can't.

797
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,370
I said, uh, why not?

798
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,090
It said on my, on your website,
when I checked my account on

799
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,880
your website, that the money was
available, she says, oh,

800
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,350
that that's, that's an error.

801
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,580
That was misleading.

802
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,770
I'm sorry that it still isn't,
we're still waiting

803
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,700
for it to come through.

804
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,190
And we're still waiting to hear
from the other.

805
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,360
And I said, okay.

806
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,770
And so I texted the supplier and
I said, they won't

807
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,880
let me take out the money.

808
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,290
I'm I'm sorry, I can't do that.

809
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:25,110
And I never heard from the
supplier or the supposed

810
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,520
thing again, Monday I called
someone who was, who I

811
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,960
felt was knowledgeable in these
sorts of situations.

812
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,540
And I said, look, here is what's
happening.

813
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,280
And she.

814
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,440
Called the Minnesota attorney
general right away.

815
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,960
And so I did, and I explained my
situation and he, he

816
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,069
said, you've been scammed.

817
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,080
He said, this is a common scam.

818
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,130
He said, what job title did they
hire you for?

819
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,080
And I said, software engineer.

820
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,870
He says, this is a common scam
for the software engineers.

821
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,529
He says you were lucky that the
bank didn't allow you to

822
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,680
take out that money in cash,
because otherwise you would be

823
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,209
held responsible for that money.

824
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:11,100
It was $6,000  he said, and, and
file a report with the

825
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:13,080
FTC and the FBI, which I did.

826
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,190
Did the

827
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,320
Dan: FBI have anything to like
similar things to say,

828
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,290
Joan: or I filed the reports
online and neither of them

829
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,520
have gotten back to me.

830
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,240
And both sites said, uh, you
know, when you file a

831
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,610
report for us, we might not get
back to you on this.

832
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,970
We'll do our best, but you know,
don't expect us to,

833
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,140
to get back to you, but.

834
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:34,525
Thank you for filing and excuse
me, here's a copy so that you

835
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,705
know that you have a record of
filing the report with us,

836
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:39,205
but that was pretty much it.

837
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:41,125
And as I said, I never heard
from them again.

838
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,755
So I was all excited to, I
thought someone was finally

839
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,195
going to hire me and then.

840
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,560
Someone didn't and I had never
heard about this scam before.

841
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,950
I mean, I've heard of other
scams, and so I've been aware of

842
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:55,860
people trying to take advantage
of me, but this one I had

843
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,200
not heard of bef ever before.

844
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,150
And it was just not something
that I expected.

845
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:05,895
. Bekah: No, I had never heard
of that.

846
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:10,634
And I think, you know, as you're
telling the story, number one, I

847
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:15,285
never would've noticed that the
addresses were different for me.

848
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:17,535
I just probably would've taken
it to the bank

849
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,734
and did what they said.

850
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:22,245
So, I mean, I think that on top
of everything else, you

851
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:26,025
took such careful steps, which
of course you never

852
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,225
should even have to do.

853
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:27,585
Right?

854
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:30,134
Like this whole entire story.

855
00:39:31,425 --> 00:39:38,085
So much extra work and stress
and conflict is being put on you

856
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,535
as you're trying to get a job.

857
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:44,355
And I just wanna say that, you
know, I think.

858
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,540
Your ability to continue to move
forward and to talk about

859
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,790
it and to openly share it is so
inspirational, I guess.

860
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,950
I mean, to see you moving
forward is, is something that

861
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,840
I really appreciate you talking

862
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:00,940
Joan: about.

863
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:02,565
Well, thank you.

864
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:04,215
I'm happy to share my story.

865
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:08,115
And I hope that the, I hope that
others are able to get

866
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,105
something out of it anyway.

867
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:10,905
Dan: Oh, absolutely.

868
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:15,675
And it's it's I just like this
approach is just like,

869
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:18,345
so I don't know, evil.

870
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:19,965
I'm trying to think of a good
word for it.

871
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:22,995
You know, you know, I've, I've
heard of this scam, not

872
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:23,865
this scam, but I've heard of.

873
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,005
The way, the check part of it
worked, right.

874
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:28,795
You know, deposit a check, take
the cash out, give it to me.

875
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:30,175
And then they cancel the check
thing.

876
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,985
But targeting people, looking
for jobs is like,

877
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,255
uh, you know, I don't know.

878
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:36,815
I dunno.

879
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,065
It's just, uh, shameful

880
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:43,075
Joan: using a legitimate site
for job postings using the

881
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,745
name of a legitimate company.

882
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:46,195
Oh

883
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:46,615
Dan: yeah.

884
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,445
I mean, that was going to be
another question I was

885
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,605
going to ask was if you had
reached out to Glassdoor

886
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,065
through all this, or mean after
it happened at all.

887
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:56,415
Joan: I went to Glassdoor and
found that the job

888
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,065
posting had been taken down.

889
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:02,775
And I felt that they probably
knew about that from that the,

890
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,395
the job posting did, did not
exist anymore, but I mean, they

891
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:11,175
were slick in the fact that they
used a legitimate job posting

892
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:14,535
site that they used the name and
a, the actual name and address

893
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:17,805
of a legitimate company that
they used a legitimate looking.

894
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:22,995
Employment contract and that at
least the HR, the

895
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:26,475
supposed HR person seemed to
have a legitimate

896
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:27,995
company email address.

897
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,070
Dan: Wow.

898
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,590
Yeah, the criminals, I'm sure
they're making a lot of money,

899
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,700
you know, scamming people like
this, it's just the emotional

900
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,880
place that people who are doing
the job seeking is in, cause

901
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:43,020
we've talked to people who have
done a lot of applications

902
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,050
and this long process and, you
know, everyone of them

903
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,120
has shared how hard it is, you
know, how the struggle

904
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,220
it is emotionally draining and
everything like that.

905
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,850
And so I would imagine your
defenses are kind of lower

906
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,150
than they would be normally
anyway, you know, so.

907
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,285
It's tough, but I would echo
what Bekah said is

908
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,515
just thank you for sharing.

909
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:04,845
That's this part of the story,
because, uh, knowing about it is

910
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:07,305
like probably the best defense
for, for other people at least.

911
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:07,485
Oh yes.

912
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,935
You know, I'm spreading the word
about it, so yeah.

913
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:11,595
It's, it's scary though.

914
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:12,675
Yeah, it is.

915
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:13,695
I don't like it.

916
00:42:15,405 --> 00:42:15,585
Bekah: Okay.

917
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,405
So now you're here, Joan.

918
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:21,105
And what is your hope

919
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:21,935
Joan: for the future?

920
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,940
I'm still applying for jobs.

921
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,620
, I'm, I'm hoping that that
someone will hire me somewhere.

922
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,440
It's pretty much all I can do at
this point,

923
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,240
because I, I do need a job.

924
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,799
I want a job.

925
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,129
I would like to work, but
because of my limitations,

926
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:41,549
I do need a remote position that
limits the number of.

927
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,500
Jobs that I can apply for, but
I'm, I'm still applying

928
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,140
and that's all I can do is just
move forward.

929
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,300
Bekah: And what kind of keeps
you going?

930
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,110
Is there, like what powers your
motivation or your perseverance

931
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,700
to keep pushing forward?

932
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,780
Joan: I'm just that sort of
person that, you know,

933
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,040
if someone says, well, you know,
you can't do that.

934
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,860
And there's a lot of obstacles
and you know, there's,

935
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,630
are you sure you wanna do?

936
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm just the sort of person who
says the heck with it.

937
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,250
I'm doing it.

938
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,060
I wanna do it.

939
00:43:15,065 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm going to do it.

940
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,730
I'm I'm do it.

941
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,210
You know what?

942
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,980
A couple, some people have asked
me.

943
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:25,420
I've gone to events where I have
re related that, that I got my

944
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,960
bachelor's degree in physics,
that I was the only woman quite

945
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,210
often in the, in the classroom.

946
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,240
And I've been asked, you know,
well, you know, how

947
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,560
did you feel about that?

948
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:39,585
And I said, well, I thought, you
know, if they didn't

949
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:40,875
like it, that was tough.

950
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:51,345
I mean, no, I mean, I guess I
was fortunate in that, that

951
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:54,525
nobody discouraged me from
getting a bachelor's degree in

952
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:57,765
physics because I was a woman
or, or looked down down on me

953
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:00,255
while I was getting my degree
into this because I was a woman.

954
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:03,680
But I, I have heard that other
women who are trying to get

955
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,350
degrees in sciences have had a
real, really tough time.

956
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,750
I didn't, but I was prepared for
it.

957
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,120
And I thought, you know, even if
they did to heck with

958
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,680
them, that's their problem.

959
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:13,399
I don't care.

960
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,189
I've always had that, that
attitude, that if I had

961
00:44:16,194 --> 00:44:20,629
a, um, a goal and it was a
legitimate goal and it

962
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:24,350
was something that didn't
compromise my moral principles,

963
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,910
I was going to go for it.

964
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:26,970
Bekah: Okay.

965
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,740
So I know also you're a prolific
writer, you've done science

966
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,270
fiction and some other things.

967
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,130
Have you ever written your life
story?

968
00:44:35,805 --> 00:44:36,615
Joan: I have not.

969
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:41,325
What I have written as far as
life story is concerned.

970
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:46,215
I am a, a star Trek fan and I've
been a star Trek fan since 1966.

971
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:52,185
And in the 1990s, I wrote a
history of star Trek fan

972
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:53,565
activity, a fan history.

973
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,885
From 1967 to 1987.

974
00:44:57,935 --> 00:45:00,815
And this is probably as close to
a biography as

975
00:45:00,815 --> 00:45:04,835
it gets  because I told my
personal journey through it.

976
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,335
But also what was happening.

977
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:11,165
This book has gotten a lot of
attention, not a lot of

978
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:13,505
public attention, but a lot of
attention from people

979
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:17,075
who are like, um, scholars in
the field of popular.

980
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:22,325
And I'm very well recognized in
the field of popular culture.

981
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,535
My star Trek fanzine collection
is at the university of

982
00:45:25,535 --> 00:45:27,275
Iowa special collections.

983
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:30,335
I was interviewed last month and
the interview was

984
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,045
posted Monday about this.

985
00:45:32,705 --> 00:45:35,795
So I've gotten a great deal of
satisfaction from

986
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:37,865
that, but the problem is.

987
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:40,470
Publishing and writing is not a
very profitable

988
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,399
endeavor, unless you're one of
like the 2% of authors

989
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,990
who can make a living at it.

990
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,720
But it's something, it's
something that I do

991
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,000
because I enjoy writing.

992
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,450
And for people who enjoy
writing, it's something

993
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,890
that you can't not do.

994
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,100
So I keep writing I'm writing
right now.

995
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:02,895
Set aside, my writing for my
current novel

996
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,665
just before this podcast.

997
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:09,255
So it is something that I do and
it's something that, that keeps

998
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:12,975
me going, but it's not something
that you can make a living with.

999
00:46:13,695 --> 00:46:16,755
And I enjoy, uh, I enjoy, I
enjoy web development.

1000
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:17,175
I've got.

1001
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:20,850
A dozen sites, dozen life sites
that I keep

1002
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,560
up and keep working on.

1003
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,509
And my GitHub repository is
solid green for this year.

1004
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,240
So this is something that I
enjoy too.

1005
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,480
And I'm just going to keep going
until I can't

1006
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,020
anymore.

1007
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,680
Bekah: Have you thought about
going back into freelancing?

1008
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:38,640
Well,

1009
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,069
Joan: yes, I'm always available
for freelance work, but nobody's

1010
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:43,620
calling  that's the problem.

1011
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, that can be hard

1012
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,120
Dan: too.

1013
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:50,940
Bekah: so have you thought about
what your ideal job

1014
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,710
or what would it look like?

1015
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:52,980
I

1016
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,140
Joan: guess.

1017
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,220
Well, if you want to talk about
ideal job, ideally, I would

1018
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,770
like to be one of the 2% of
authors who makes a living off

1019
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,840
of my writing and publishing.

1020
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,090
But again, it's so hard to get
into that 2% of authors.

1021
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,830
So failing that.

1022
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:14,205
I really enjoyed my first job as
an airline

1023
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:17,745
programmer programming, the, the
hotel reservations

1024
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:18,915
and the flight schedules.

1025
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:20,505
That was a lot of fun.

1026
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:22,245
I enjoyed that so much.

1027
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:26,055
And I was so disappointed when
the company took

1028
00:47:26,055 --> 00:47:26,955
me off that project.

1029
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,435
I mean, something like that, a
web development project,

1030
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,215
where I can use my skills, where
I can make a nice front

1031
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:37,095
end for somebody that would be a
wonderful job to have.

1032
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:40,515
Dan: Now, what was it about that
airline project that

1033
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:41,005
Joan: you liked?

1034
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:44,354
First of all, I was programming
in Fortran, which is, which is a

1035
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:46,455
language that I enjoy very much.

1036
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:49,125
I've forgotten most of it by now
though.

1037
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:50,285
So I couldn.

1038
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:54,045
Be a suitable fit for a legacy
Fortran projects.

1039
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,205
And I've been told that they're
out there, but I

1040
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:59,685
was programming Fortran
programming in Fortran was fun.

1041
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:05,025
The airline scheduling was, was
a lot of fun because it was

1042
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:06,315
just something that you could.

1043
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,440
Put your hands on and look at it
and, and get satisfaction

1044
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,380
out of, you know, people are
using my stuff every day.

1045
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,040
Yes.

1046
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,130
And, and, you know, it's, it's,
it's something that's

1047
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,890
useful and it's something that's
good looking.

1048
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,370
And I did it, you know, that,
that kind of satisfaction

1049
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,030
that you get from the job, the
hotel reservations.

1050
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,060
I mean, I actually.

1051
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:33,765
Did a lot of the hotel
reservation stuff from the

1052
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:38,145
ground up, I designed a hotel
reservations thing, as well

1053
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:39,795
as wrote the code for it.

1054
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:43,305
I designed the concept, they
just said, give us a way

1055
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,715
to do hotel reservations.

1056
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,205
So I did the designing too on
that one.

1057
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:49,395
And so that, that was something
that I was proud

1058
00:48:49,395 --> 00:48:52,545
of, but yeah, the, the, the
flight schedule was a, was a

1059
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:54,405
lot of fun and very satisfy.

1060
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,920
Dan: That's awesome.

1061
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,570
I can totally relate to that.

1062
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,450
Especially the, this is actually
useful and people

1063
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,230
are actually using it.

1064
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,010
part of it.

1065
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:02,160
Yes.

1066
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,880
You know, it doesn't always
happen, you know, in, in any

1067
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,070
particular job, you know, so I
can totally relate to that.

1068
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:10,815
Bekah: Joan, I wanna say, thank
you so much again,

1069
