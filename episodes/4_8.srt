00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:09,253
Bekah: Hello, and welcome to
season four, episode eight of the

2
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:14,273
Virtual Coffee podcast. I'm
Bekah. And this is a podcast that

3
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:18,443
features members of the Virtual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

4
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:21,353
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of their

5
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:24,294
coding journey. And they're here
on this podcast, sharing their

6
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:27,474
stories and what they've learned.
And we're here to share it with

7
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,833
you. Here with me today is my
cohost, Dan.

8
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,945
Dan: Thanks Bekah. Today is the
penultimate episode of season

9
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:38,454
four and we're ending on a really
good one. We sat down with Dr.

10
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,064
Maeling Murphy, a software
engineer who recently

11
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:44,604
transitioned into tech after an
eight plus year journey as a PhD

12
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:49,015
research scientist in material
science and engineering, and also

13
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:53,134
creating her own digital content
creation business. Maeling shared

14
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,825
with us, her approach to finding
employers with the right culture

15
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,825
for you, some ideas on how
contributing to open-source

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,884
projects can help prepare you for
your first job. And the value of

17
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,254
developing the connection to
community and being able to grow

18
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:08,545
alongside others. We also talked
at length about her habit of

19
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:11,515
taking notes as she works. And
she was patient enough to answer

20
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,795
all of our questions about
finding the right approach.

21
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,674
Bekah: We start every episode of
the podcast. Like we start every

22
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:19,344
Virtual Coffee. We introduce
ourselves with our name, where

23
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,795
we're from, what we do and a
random check-in question. We hope

24
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:34,030
you enjoy this episode. Our
random question today is if you

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,000
could have someone follow you
around all the time, like a

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,760
personal assistant, what would
you have them do?

27
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:41,849
Maeling: oh man.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,810
Bekah: Thinking about that. My
name is Bekah. front end

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,069
developer from a small town in
Ohio. And I, there are like

30
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,950
little things that I don't like
to do that I would like them to

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,959
do, or like to remember for me,
like, tomorrow your kid has, has

32
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,379
silly hat day. Like I never
remember that it's silly hat day

33
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,210
until the morning. So they'll
make sure that the silly hat is

34
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,449
put out in that I've turned off
the stove that I have all my

35
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,419
Christmas presents, that kind of
stuff. And calling insurance

36
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,930
companies. Yeah, they would
definitely make all of the

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,080
insurance company phone calls
because that was the worst.

38
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:30,504
Dan: Yeah, that's a good one. Um,
hi, I'm Dan. I'm a developer from

39
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:38,305
Cleveland, Ohio. And, um, yeah, I
mean, don't know one answer is

40
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:42,625
what would I not have them do?
Uh, but then I was thinking about

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,094
it a little bit in the first
thing that really popped to my

42
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:47,485
mind would be, you know, to
remind me of what I went into a

43
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:50,455
room to do or remind me of, you
know, like I go down to the

44
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:55,414
basement get something from
pantry. but just like I'm on

45
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,419
autopilot and I go and open the
frigerator that's down there. And

46
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,215
then I'm just staring at the
frigerator wondering. I'm doing

47
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:02,395
when I

48
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,909
Bekah: I've done that before. I
was like looking for my keys and

49
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,490
I was like, wait a minute. Our
keys are

50
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,185
Dan: so just like somebody that
could be like, Hey, yo, you're

51
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,715
supposed to get the cereal for
down here.

52
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,224
Maeling: and whispering just like

53
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,805
Dan: right. They can do it in a
way that wouldn't let anyone else

54
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:22,354
know that I, uh, yeah, I forgot.
That would be the, that'd be,

55
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:26,134
yeah, that'd be a high value, a
high value, uh, uh, itself. But

56
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:26,925
that's what I'm going to go with.

57
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,520
Maeling: My name is Maeling. I'm
a software engineer based out of

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,819
Atlanta, Georgia. I would have to
say the first thing that came to

59
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,240
my mind was meal planning,
everything surrounding meal

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,659
planning. I would just pass off
on to them because I feel like so

61
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,780
much of my time is dedicated
towards answering the question.

62
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,349
are we going to eat today for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And

63
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,330
so of that pass to them. If they
want to order things, actually do

64
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,680
the meal prep too. That's fine
by.

65
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,650
Bekah: Oh, I love that this, I
had really busy October and so

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,110
like, I don't don't have the
brain power for this. So we

67
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,050
started getting Hungryroot. we
are not sponsored by Hungryroot,

68
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,099
but I am open to a Hungryroot
sponsorships. So if anybody knows

69
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,470
how to do that, send me food as
payment, but it's really nice.

70
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,519
Cause it was like healthy food a
lot of different varieties for

71
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,709
all of the meals. And and it was
good. It didn't like taste

72
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,290
terrible. It was super easy
through most of it in the air

73
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,250
fryer and call it a day. And that
was, I felt like a game changer.

74
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,865
Maeling: Yeah, that sounds
incredibly useful.

75
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:41,875
Bekah: Yeah, so welcome Maeling.
We are very, very happy to have

76
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:46,314
you here with us, um, on this
fourth season of Virtual Coffee

77
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:50,545
Podcasts, and we always get
started with origin story, and I

78
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:54,925
know yours is think it's super
interesting. So I'm really

79
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,035
excited to hear you tell more
about how you got to this point

80
00:04:59,035 --> 00:04:59,214
in your.

81
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:04,944
Maeling: Sure. Um, so I will try
to make this as linear as

82
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:10,194
possible. Um, where should I
start? So my background is in

83
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:13,975
material science and engineering.
It's what I did for undergrad,

84
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:19,980
but I did my PhD in. But during
my graduate school experience,

85
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,860
that's kind of where I started
delving into the world of tech.

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,750
So while I was in grad school, I
kind of started experimenting

87
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,329
with websites and blogging. I
don't know if you remember the

88
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,040
platform blogger, but I started
blogging there and then switched

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,189
over to WordPress and ended up
building this like lifestyle

90
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,360
brand that turned into a company
that I ran for about eight years.

91
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,600
And in the course of running that
business, I started doing work

92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,019
with other businesses and helping
them with their social media

93
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,310
presence and also doing a few
website development projects on

94
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,004
the side. And the deeper I got
into that work. I enjoyed the

95
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:01,814
development side, um, more than I
did the marketing and the social

96
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:06,855
media aspect necessarily. And so
I started having like these great

97
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:10,394
ideas for different clients
websites, and I quickly realized

98
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:14,144
that my vision of what I wanted
to achieve did not match my level

99
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:16,319
of programming. Because at the
time, you know, I'd been

100
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,449
tinkering with HTML CSS, I
started wanting to build full

101
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,620
fledged backend stuff. And it's
like, you know what, let me, I've

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,720
been playing around with this for
awhile and you know, I'd done

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,959
some classes in high school,
HTML, CSS. I was like, you know,

104
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:37,230
I really want to explore path of
actual programming and just see

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,360
where it leads me. Like, I, I,
when I started. More folk, like

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,610
my more focused journey into tech
started the end of 2019. and I

107
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,129
started reaching out to the tech
community on Twitter found a lot

108
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,449
of resources just to explore the
path towards becoming a software

109
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,000
engineer. And since 2019, I just
went on the self-directed

110
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,329
journey. Definitely. I wouldn't
say self-taught because there's

111
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:10,514
just been so many people and
communities and resources. I have

112
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,985
been so integral to my journey. I
did not do it alone. Um, that's

113
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:21,024
how I, um, here, and I guess kind
of like my short version.

114
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,389
Bekah: All right. I need to dive
into this a little bit more

115
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,550
because you have a PhD in
Material Science and Engineering.

116
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:33,704
And you you've gone to all of
these different, very exciting

117
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:41,324
places. So, how do you go to
school for that long and, and of

118
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:44,055
decide to do your own thing?
That's a hard decision for a lot

119
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:44,355
of people.

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,379
Maeling: you know, I understand
that. I think part of it is just

121
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:55,290
my personality. like to try a lot
of different things. Um, I have a

122
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,310
lot of different interests and.
There's never really a time. I'm

123
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,139
just focused in on like one
avenue. And so, you know, while I

124
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,100
was in grad school, I was doing
all of digital marketing, social

125
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,639
media stuff. Um, what really
helped me crystallize my decision

126
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,709
to make a full transition into
tech was the fact that I wanted

127
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,970
to design my lifestyle in a way
that allowed me more flexibility,

128
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,879
since, you know, I had just given
birth to my son, uh, like I was

129
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,460
pregnant with him, like, see
right when I was doing my

130
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:39,629
dissertation and like I defendant
and gave... Yeah. Once I

131
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:43,679
graduated and, you know, I had my
son, I really started exploring

132
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,379
more flexible career
opportunities. And he said,

133
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,980
excuse me. And I, um, just
evaluated my interest in said,

134
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,070
you know, let me at least give
this programming a shot. You

135
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,404
know, it's something that I'm
interested in. Let's see. If I

136
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:59,184
can make a career out of this,
because I really felt, from what

137
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:03,414
I was reading and this was, you
know, before, um, the pandemic.

138
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:07,195
So remote jobs weren't as big as
they are now, but I still felt

139
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:10,794
like I could potentially have
more flexibility, and being able

140
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:16,350
to work from home, down the road.
and. Pursue something I was

141
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,799
passionate about. I love the
problem solving that programming

142
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,029
affords me. I mean, of, uh, the
skills that I developed as an

143
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,840
engineer in the material science
world directly translate to

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,029
programming as well as a software
engineer. So Yeah, that's, That's

145
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,970
kind of how I transition.

146
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,200
Bekah: That's awesome. And I
think, you know, so many, there's

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,639
so many moms out there that I
hear talk about wanting

148
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,919
flexibility, but in wanting to be
engaged, um, intellectually and

149
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,269
what they're doing. And I, that's
the same thing that I really love

150
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,360
about coding too, is that I can
do that. You know, I can have the

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,429
time to work part time and, and
do the mom thinks that I want to

152
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:03,335
be able to do, also. Even if my
house is destroyed at the end of

153
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,274
the day, usually I have
accomplished something with my

154
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,835
code. Now that doesn't happen all
the time, but it's nice to feel

155
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:15,424
engaged in that way. And I
definitely definitely understand

156
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:25,350
that. So when you pretty early on
in Virtual Coffee, I think it was

157
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,279
early on for you. I was early on
from what I remember you, you

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,379
built this homeschool app that
was gorgeous. And we were doing a

159
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,769
demo days, monthly challenge. And
you were, you were up for it. You

160
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,470
were like, yeah, I'm going to do
this. And I was like, this is

161
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:47,565
awesome. And you presented it
and. I mean, it is very, very

162
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:52,365
beautiful. I'll have the link to
it in the show notes, but can you

163
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:56,475
talk to us about how you went
about developing that and like

164
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:59,174
getting the courage to present it
to all of these people?

165
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:04,184
Maeling: Oh man. Okay. So to
start that story, it goes back

166
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:10,485
to. Me starting to take the CS50
Harvard Introduction to Computer

167
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:14,504
Science course. And a part of
that course at the end, you have

168
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:17,534
to build, you know, this kind of
capstone project, integrating all

169
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:23,235
of the skills that you've learned
and for my project, Um, it was,

170
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:27,375
you know, based in like Flask
using Python, hadn't really

171
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,465
delved into the world of
JavaScript too much. And

172
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:34,245
initially, you know, the, the
requirements for the project were

173
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:41,190
not. Very the scope was not very
large, the idea that I had I

174
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,789
quickly realized was way beyond
what the course had taught me.

175
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,644
And so. You know, I tried to
think of a project. First of all,

176
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:51,044
that was something that I knew I
was going to be interested in.

177
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:54,434
And for me, being able to keep
track of my homeschooling

178
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,654
activities for my child was
something I knew that was going

179
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:59,024
to motivate me to continue
working on the project. I didn't

180
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:01,575
want to start it in abandoned
that I really wanted to see it

181
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:05,384
through. And so as I started
working on the project and

182
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:09,279
started exhausting, what I had,
you know, Been able to apply for

183
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,139
my CS 50 course, I turn to
Twitter and, long story short, I

184
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,190
got involved in the 100 Days of
Code Challenge And in the midst

185
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,740
of that, I was always finding
resources that would help me with

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,490
different parts of the project.
And as I would successfully

187
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,585
implement certain things. The
ideas just kept pouring. And I

188
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,195
was like, Oh, maybe I can add
this now, maybe I can add this.

189
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:34,845
And, um, I started talking with
people, who I think could

190
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:38,835
potentially use the site and got
their feedback as well. And so by

191
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:43,934
the time I came to Virtual
Coffee, I'd already been in the

192
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,215
state of, you know, being
comfortable sharing my work

193
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:50,414
because I quickly realized the
more I shared, the more I could

194
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:56,054
learn, from the community and it,
it just really helped to, Just

195
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:59,054
cement, my understanding, being
able to talk about what I was

196
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:02,804
working on, even I would run into
issues, learning how to phrase

197
00:13:02,804 --> 00:13:06,764
those questions, to be able to
get meaningful assistance, like

198
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:11,504
all of that was so helpful. And
so, I was really excited about,

199
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:14,745
uh, that challenge, that Virtual
Coffee hosted because it was

200
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:19,995
formal way for me to do what I
had been doing on Twitter. and so

201
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,384
I'm really grateful, you know,
for community like Virtual Coffee

202
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:27,210
and the challenges that, uh, The
community offers because they're

203
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,720
just so beneficial for your
development as a developer.

204
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,504
Bekah: Oh, thanks.

205
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:39,184
Dan: Yeah, that, uh, the, I mean,
I was, I was just kind of

206
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,825
cruising around on the, on the
school journal app and it it's

207
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,674
really cool. And, you know, when
I was kind of looking around, I

208
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:48,485
saw the, um, the learning log and
I assume that's part of the a

209
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:53,674
Hundred Days of, of Code, um, you
know, thing, which I've, I know a

210
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,164
lot of people that have very
excited about that. I haven't

211
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,924
done it, but I was, you know, I,
I found it very interested in

212
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:03,019
seeing the sort of daily progress
and, and you logged it and. And

213
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,100
we'll, we can put a link to this
in the show notes too. Right. But

214
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,340
you have this a one document.
Right? All of these, all of

215
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,330
these, uh, all of your days sort
of day's progress. And then days,

216
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,330
you know, I know you have where
you have to like some thoughts or

217
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,710
like, you know, links to stuff.
And, um, and it's very cool. It's

218
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,779
really cool to see that all kind
of put together in one place. So

219
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,970
that's the times I think people,
I don't, I don't know what the.

220
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,590
or whatever of a Hundred Days of
Code are, but, uh, I see them on

221
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,330
Twitter and stuff like that a
lot, you know, and it's, and it's

222
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,759
always cool to see people's like
work, but, um, it all, uh, in one

223
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,840
place, you know, one project.
Right. Uh, it's very cool. As I

224
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,490
was kind of wondering if you
wanted to talk a little bit more

225
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,649
about, um, like that specific to
this app, you know, or to this

226
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,835
project, you know, how. I don't
know. I like how that helped you,

227
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:55,434
how you, you know, the things you
got value out of it, was it like

228
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:58,134
a chore? Was it, you know I mean?
Like I just thought I'd talk a

229
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,335
little bit about that experience
because it's really cool.

230
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:03,809
Maeling: I'm really glad you
brought that up because, um, my

231
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,299
motivation, so the, the name of
the repo is called My Learning

232
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,879
Path. And early on in my journey,
I was looking at a lot of

233
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,240
inspirational blog posts of
people who succeeded, excuse me,

234
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,320
successfully transitioned tech.
And I came across. This one blog

235
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,559
posts. I wish I could remember
his name, he linked to this

236
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,429
template. I, I borrowed that
template from him and it was just

237
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:31,299
so fascinating to see his journey
from not knowing a line of

238
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:36,039
JavaScript to, you know, a year
and a half later, having this.

239
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,019
Professional, uh, role in
programming. And I knew from that

240
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,529
moment that I wanted to record
every moment of my path. So I

241
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,509
could always look back and see
how I progressed one then two

242
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,830
serve as just a resource I could
share with other people. So they

243
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,399
could see what resources that I
encountered along my way, could

244
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,279
potentially be helpful for them
and in being encouraging in their

245
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,980
own journeys. And so. For me
having that, uh, that repo where

246
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,269
I would, you know, update daily
for the most part, was very

247
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,240
encouraging. It was my
motivating, one of my motivating

248
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,065
forces, uh, And that kept me
excited during this, you know,

249
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:23,384
self-directed path because I can
always look back you know, see

250
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:27,764
what I'd accomplished or things
that I had questions about. And

251
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:32,115
it would be a great way for me to
be able to reach out and just not

252
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,205
lose track of what I was learning
and what I needed assistance

253
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:39,225
with. And so, for the project
itself, it was just a natural

254
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,434
progression to include all of the
updates for that as well.

255
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,820
Definitely helped when it came
time to troubleshoot different,

256
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,799
uh, aspects. And then also helped
me just remember the amount of

257
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,259
work I put into certain features.
So when it was time to talk about

258
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,549
my project with two employers,
um, it was very easy for me to

259
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,360
remember the work that I'd put
into it.

260
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:06,585
Dan: Yeah, I think that's great.
I love this and it's one of those

261
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:10,035
things that always seems very
valuable to me. And I don't, I

262
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:12,585
have trouble with getting myself
to do, know, things like this.

263
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:15,525
Uh, you know, you mentioned the
template and the template is, is

264
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:19,900
literally. Uh, the date. so it's,
today's progress, thoughts, link

265
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,569
to work and resources and that's
it. Right. So each day is just,

266
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,769
it's just that. So, um, uh,
simple, very simple format and a

267
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,619
very, you know, it turns out to
be a very, I think, valuable

268
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:36,250
tool. Um, so do you, like, I know
that I'm sure it's not the same

269
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,819
every day, obviously, but like
it, did you work into like, was

270
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:44,085
this part of your routine of sort
of ending the day or, uh, Like,

271
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,154
when do you write these
summaries? This is the kind of

272
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:49,785
thing. I also like pick people's
brains that successfully do these

273
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,214
things, because I, you know, I'm
always trying to like figure out

274
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:55,035
how to, how to do it. You know
what I mean? I feel like I'm out

275
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:55,934
the door every day, so

276
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,785
Maeling: yeah. for me, what
worked best was to do it. Just as

277
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,414
I was doing the work. So for
instance, um, like if I was

278
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:10,634
troubleshooting, um, a specific
feature or if I was learning

279
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:14,654
something new in a language, I
would just copy those links and

280
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:17,744
just drop them in the document.
And then if I had thoughts about

281
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,684
it later, once I'd had time to
digest, I would throw those

282
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,799
thoughts in there or. Thoughts in
the moment, even if I was unclear

283
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,650
about something. So for me, it
wasn't a really defined

284
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,619
structure. It was just as I
worked, if something stood out to

285
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,140
me that I should throw it in
there, I would just pop it in

286
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,369
there. And so what really helped
was having my, uh, vs code for

287
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:43,400
that repo open at all times on my
desktop and just made for easy

288
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,839
transfer of resources.

289
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,809
Dan: And that's a great, uh,
that's such a great habit. I feel

290
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,950
like that to do, you know, I
could see how that could be so

291
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,829
useful, you know, is like, this
makes me think back to our random

292
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:01,904
question. I could also, you know,
it's the same thing of, um, You

293
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,795
know, walking down to the
basement and forgetting about a

294
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:05,954
thing, you know, thinking about
something else. And I do that

295
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,055
same thing to myself, even when
I'm writing code. Right. Or I

296
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,214
have a question I'm like, oh,
that'd be cool. Or I wonder how

297
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,914
this works. And I'm like, well,
let's fix this other thing, you

298
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:16,845
know, and then forget about it.
Uh, so, you know, um, if you can

299
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:20,174
get yourself to take those notes
as you work, I think that's, I

300
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:20,984
think that's very cool.

301
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:24,045
Maeling: Yeah, it's really
helpful for me now, even in my

302
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:27,855
role, don't do a repo for it, but
I have, you know, a notion doc

303
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:32,355
that has different notebooks. So
as I run into issues and I

304
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:36,315
resolve them, I quickly update
that as I'm working, because.

305
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,930
Inevitably, sometimes you run
into the same issue and you're

306
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,140
like, wait, how did I figure this
out again? And so it's, there's

307
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,099
like a great resource, uh, you
know, troubleshooting and just,

308
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,890
you know, learning the different
parts of the code base and things

309
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,569
like that. So that's just me. I
have to take notes. Um, just how

310
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,819
my brain operates.

311
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,819
Bekah: I really love that. So I
am trying to like Notion and I

312
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,779
continually don't. So is there a
template that you've used that

313
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:06,869
works for you? I think it's just
overwhelming. There's so much.

314
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:10,634
Maeling: oh, I totally get it. I
will have to share the link with

315
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:15,015
you because I did find this
template basically set up, um,

316
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:19,315
notebooks on one page. And so
I'll have a notebook. For, you

317
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,835
know, different repos and the
code base or for different

318
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:26,154
technologies. And so it's very,
very easy to stay organized for

319
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,615
me that way. And so, yeah, I'll
have to share that link with you

320
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:31,164
cause it's, it's been great.
Cause Yeah, when I first started

321
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:35,484
using notion and just saw that
blank page, like, well, where do

322
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,664
I start here? How do I, you know,
make this effective? So

323
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,869
Bekah: and there's so much you
can do with it. And if you're

324
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,490
sharing it with other people,
then it's just a whole can of

325
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,509
worms that you have to, like, all
using it in their own ways. And

326
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:50,529
like.

327
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:54,884
Maeling: I got it. I will say
though, like. um, when I did

328
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:58,244
start using Notion, um, during
the job search as well, and

329
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:01,115
there's a great template that
someone from VC shared for the

330
00:21:01,464 --> 00:21:01,654
job

331
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:02,585
Bekah: Karen I think.

332
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:06,434
Maeling: yeah its so great. but
in addition to that, um, using

333
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,075
tables and notion, I don't know
if you've ever tried it, but

334
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,375
when, because I was on Twitter
all the time and you know, you'll

335
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,704
see all these tweets with like,
all of the amazing resources that

336
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,865
you should check out all the
time. And I was quickly

337
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,105
overwhelmed with the amount of
bookmarks that I had on Twitter.

338
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:25,785
And so tables and notion, you can
tag them, you can create your own

339
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:30,404
database in Notion I would like
sh uh, save my different links

340
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:33,404
and then tag them with like, oh,
this is for JavaScript, or this

341
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:39,765
is for AWS. Or, you know, this is
for doing databases. And so when

342
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,275
I'd go back and wanting to, study
a certain topic, I could just

343
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:45,734
search my tags and quickly see
all of the links for that

344
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,724
resource. Instead of trying to
come through Twitter bookmarks.

345
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:52,674
Bekah: That's useful. I keep
thinking about what, how to do

346
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:55,734
something like that for Virtual
Coffee, because we have so many

347
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:59,065
people contributing to coffee
chats. Every week we get so many

348
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:03,684
great resources. I want to have a
repository where we can just send

349
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:06,325
people. These, these are things
that our members have

350
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,825
recommended, but I really do like
the idea of having tags there. I

351
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:17,154
think that makes it, um, easier
and more organized to use and

352
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:19,404
other things I've explored.

353
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,595
Dan: Yeah, for sure. I, I use,
uh, he's an app called Pinboard

354
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:27,224
that's very old school, uh,
bookmarking app that has

355
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:31,474
somewhere else survived. Uh,
it's, and it just bookmarks and

356
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,214
Antech. I think I can add notes
to things, but, um, I don't

357
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:37,424
usually, but I have found that
when I can remember to get them

358
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,065
in there, you know, it's like the
habit for me is the, is the hard

359
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:40,545
part. And

360
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,380
Bekah: Pinboard is on your site,
right?

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,369
Dan: Uh, is it,

362
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,259
Bekah: I think it is because I
believe that I have gone there a

363
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,690
couple of times. Cause I'm like,
I know Dan talked about this

364
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,849
resource. Somebody go check his
Pinboard.

365
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:53,759
Dan: Um,

366
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,809
Bekah: using Dan's pinboard.

367
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,029
Dan: that's cool. Yeah, no, every
once in a while I share it links

368
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,220
to it, but like, I, I forget
about it sometimes. And other

369
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,069
than that, you know, but it's, I,
I'm always so thankful for when I

370
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:06,430
have remembered and then go back,
you know what I mean? And, and,

371
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,869
you know, grab a grip link from
whatever random, you know, CSS or

372
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,759
note or whatever um, feel like
that. Um, yeah, the Twitter

373
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,230
bookmarks is, is hard to, I, it
works better for me as, as an

374
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,569
inbox of things to process, you
know, and then stick somewhere

375
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,240
else. I think if it's going to,
if you're going to try to, um,

376
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,779
use it for resources. No. I love
the idea of creating your own

377
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,700
like database to like that.
That's

378
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:34,355
Bekah: There is I,

379
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,829
Dan: that's cool.

380
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,615
Bekah: yeah, sorry. I

381
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,595
Dan: like a notion. Sorry.

382
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:40,875
Bekah: There's one thing in
notion that I do like, and I'll

383
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:44,174
include a link in the show notes,
but it's the front end developer

384
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:49,575
learning guide. And it's, it's
one page and it has a checklist.

385
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:53,355
And I really like checklists and
it has resources with tags. Now

386
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:56,954
that you say that it reminded me
like different sections. And so

387
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:02,144
it's different than the roadmap,
but I like it because. just

388
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:06,075
really breaks down different
things to learn and provides

389
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:09,555
resources for that. So I have not
vetted this and I'm not sure how

390
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:14,384
old it is, but I really do
appreciate how it's organized and

391
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:18,224
how there's, there's a journey
through that, thing that I can

392
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:26,710
understand. Um, so the, the other
thing too, I think re we

393
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,220
frequently get the question or
people wanting to talk in Virtual

394
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,910
Coffee about note taking and how
people keep up with this stuff.

395
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,509
So just love this part of the
conversation, but have you been

396
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:43,509
able to take into your job that
you're doing now? Are you still

397
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:45,759
taking notes or do you still find
that useful.

398
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,240
Maeling: Oh, absolutely. So I've
gotten a lot of great advice from

399
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,569
those VC chats about note taking
I take notes, um, in notion

400
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,690
primarily, and then also just in
a regular notebook, because I

401
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,799
feel like in meetings it's
quicker for me to just jot down

402
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,819
things and then be able to flesh
it out in notion later. But like

403
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:11,714
on the spot, definitely my paper
note taking, um, And then for,

404
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,474
you know, like I mentioned, like
taking notes when I'm working on

405
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:18,585
a ticket, I have like notebooks
for different tickets. Just so I

406
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:21,674
can keep track of, you know, the
issues that. I'm working through

407
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:27,224
and techniques that I'm learning
and you know, uh, parts of the

408
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:30,855
code base and the foundational
knowledge that I'm ramping up on.

409
00:25:30,855 --> 00:25:33,855
Cause there's just, you know,
always so much to, to pick up on.

410
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,525
So Yeah. I'm, I'm definitely
still note-taking for.

411
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,654
Bekah: Yeah. And so as part of
that process, is that something

412
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:45,605
that you take in to maybe
one-on-ones with you or, you

413
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:49,714
know, what, if somebody was
asking, should I, is it important

414
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:54,275
that I invest in starting to do
note taking as part of my

415
00:25:54,515 --> 00:26:00,095
developer journey? I you would
say yes. But you talk, like, what

416
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,434
would you tell them?

417
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:07,319
Maeling: I would say to give it a
try and try not to overcomplicate

418
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,039
it, it's just starting small, you
know, jotting down ideas or

419
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,119
questions. But, I will say that
the benefits are worth the time

420
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,460
invested. Um, I know for me
personally, like in my one-on-one

421
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,299
meetings with my manager, like I
have a template for those

422
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,670
meetings as well. So those are
another place where we're kind of

423
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,460
taking notes for like, I have for
him or next steps. then he

424
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,099
actually initiated something for
the team where we have our weekly

425
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,890
highlights and lowlights. And so
that's another form of kind of

426
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,549
like note taking. So during the
week, as I, you know, come across

427
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,984
things that I feel like worthy of
that document, I'll just include

428
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:50,875
that as well. And so, I, for me,
it just really helps. There's

429
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,535
just so much information to
process all the time. And for me,

430
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:58,105
it helps if I can dump that out
of my head, to somewhere else

431
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:02,875
that is easily searchable
reference and easily sharable as

432
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,255
well.

433
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:09,234
Bekah: I love that. I think
really breaking down those, what

434
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:12,545
you're working on too helps to
solidify those ideas in your

435
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,654
head. Or I know like sometimes
I'll be writing something that

436
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:19,255
doesn't click, because I want to
ask you a question about it and

437
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:20,775
then suddenly like, oh wait a
minute.

438
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:21,515
Maeling: Yup.

439
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:24,505
Bekah: I know what I should be
doing here. Or I know what I

440
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:28,914
missed. And so having that as I,
I don't do a good job of note

441
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:34,095
taking while I am working, but
it's something that I am working

442
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:38,775
towards. so maybe if you share
that notion doc, I will do a

443
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:39,585
better job of it.

444
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:47,474
Dan: Do you end up, um, you know,
an Oracle or, or another places,

445
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:49,484
you know, you talked about
sharing stuff that I was just

446
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:53,894
curious about. Do you, do you
share, like, through notion, you

447
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:58,424
know, directly, know, do you use
like tools, like sharing views

448
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:03,164
through notion or are you of use
notion as your own, um, like

449
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:06,285
collection and then, you know,
some other document to share? Um,

450
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:08,144
That makes sense.

451
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:11,535
Maeling: In notion that's great.
You know, you can have, I feel

452
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,005
like this is turning into a
notion,

453
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,309
Bekah: was just thinking I'm
like, this is going to be our

454
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:16,079
Notion episode.

455
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:19,394
Maeling: But I, I love, I love
note taking, um, you know, and it

456
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:23,654
probably makes sense because, you
know, in my, uh, graduate school,

457
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,089
Working in the lab, we had to
keep a research lab notebook. So

458
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:30,089
I had to document everything
every day for all of the

459
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:33,420
experiments, because when it was
time to write our papers, you had

460
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,630
to be able to reference those
details. So now I'm of making

461
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,569
that connection. That's probably
why I'm a little bit obsessive

462
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:44,355
notes. Um, but Yeah. back to
notion you can have, you know,

463
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:49,515
private notes and public notes
all in the same, uh, profile. So

464
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:53,835
it's easy to, you know, make a
public note and just pull certain

465
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,815
things that you'd want to share
from your private notes and put

466
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:59,144
it there. So you don't have to
share your entire private, you

467
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:02,025
know, notebook. For instance,
that answers your question.

468
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,174
Dan: totally. Yeah. I was just
like, you know, so for example,

469
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:09,045
you, you had, um, a section for
your one-on-ones with your

470
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,384
manager or whatever, and I was
just like, oh, what does demand,

471
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:14,654
you know, is that like you guys
can, you know, collaborating in

472
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:17,444
notion or is it more just, you
know, you're collecting your own

473
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:20,414
stuff and then basically reading
from it to, you know, when you,

474
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,164
when you, when you talk

475
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,759
Maeling: right. Yeah. I
definitely have a mix, a mix of

476
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,779
private and public.

477
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,994
Dan: Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's
awesome. Another, another nice

478
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:31,964
thing about notion. I, I keep
wanting, when I do notes, I keep

479
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:35,654
them just in notebook, on my, on
my, on my Mac. And it's very, you

480
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,174
know, very simple and it works,
you know, but it's, it's not, it

481
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,484
doesn't have like all that nice,
you know, those nice tools like

482
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:41,835
that. So that's cool.

483
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:45,700
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and no
taking is so personal too, so

484
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,789
everybody will find something and
it's, it's like one of those

485
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:52,740
almost controversial topics. I
feel like because people like

486
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,049
love their note taking software
so much that there will be like

487
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,980
arguments over, you know, whether
or not that is the right one to

488
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,630
use. There's not the right one.
There's whatever works for you.

489
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:13,259
And it's great that you found
process through that you've done.

490
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,440
And you're still able to carry
that with you and see that work

491
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,799
as a software developer software
engineer. Um, and so, okay. So

492
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,140
you've done all of this stuff and
you seem very organized to me you

493
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,630
also have a kid at home. And so
what was that transition like

494
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:40,500
going from learning as a mom to
working as a mom? It sounds like

495
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,000
you've kind of been that your
whole career, but can be a big

496
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:47,160
change when you're diving into a
new profession.

497
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:53,984
Maeling: Absolutely. So, you
know, when I was learning. I just

498
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:59,505
had to schedule around my child.
And, and so there were many, you

499
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:02,865
know, days where I would be
programming mostly at night or

500
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,224
early in the morning before he
was up. But you know, now that

501
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:09,015
I'm working in my professional
role, like I just have to like

502
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,744
give a huge shout out to my
husband because I could not do

503
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:16,454
this without him. You know,
especially because it's a little

504
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:21,525
bit more of a formal. Um,
structure. It's not like, you

505
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,924
know, be at your desk nine to
five, there's flexible, flexible

506
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,615
working hours, but you know, to
be really in the zone, you need,

507
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:33,555
at least I need long stretches of
time, like uninterrupted time to

508
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:39,434
really like get in there and
resolve issues. so me, it's, it's

509
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:42,855
great that I, you know, I'm able
to work from home and still be

510
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:46,244
able to spend time with my child.
But like my husband is also

511
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:51,029
there. You know, being active
with him as well. And so I don't

512
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:56,369
feel guilty for working because I
know he's taken care of as well,

513
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,619
because me and I, we talked about
this, like in a VC, um, meeting

514
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,535
in the past, but I when I was
looking in, like, when I actually

515
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:08,174
started looking into software
engineering as a career, I was

516
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:12,345
very hesitant to start searching
for jobs. because I just wasn't

517
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,505
sure if it was going to fit my
lifestyle, you know, after

518
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:17,805
working for eight years, running
my own business and setting my

519
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:21,795
own schedule, it was hard for me
to wrap my mind around making

520
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:24,585
that transition because I just
enjoyed the freedom that I had.

521
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:28,845
And it wasn't until I spoke with
a friend who was also a software

522
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:33,464
engineer and also a mom told me
was like, no, you know, they're

523
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:37,845
remote work opportunities that
have flexible working hours and

524
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:42,255
accommodate parents. like, what I
did not know that this was

525
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:45,775
possible, you know, and the
opportunities increased in the

526
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:51,194
remote you know, following the
pandemic. I just was not aware

527
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:55,319
of. All of the different company
cultures. I, I just had in my

528
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,779
mind, a stereotypical, you know,
you work at a startup or

529
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,650
whatever. Like you're going to be
working early mornings, late

530
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:07,289
nights every day, all day, all
week. And when I finally actually

531
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,289
started the job search process, I
quickly realized that companies

532
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:14,579
have different cultures and
possible to find one that fits

533
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:18,839
your lifestyle. And so, yeah,
it's, it's been a great

534
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,859
transition. I felt, I feel like
I've had a lot of. From the

535
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,690
family side and also on, um, my
job site, like I have a really

536
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:31,019
supportive team, really
supportive manager, and it's just

537
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,529
made this transition or really
exciting one.

538
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,555
Dan: That's very cool. you were,
when you were searching for. May

539
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:45,134
not.. Maybe not when you began
the job search, but when you you

540
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:47,595
know, learning about these
different cultures things like

541
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:53,535
that, what were there, how did
you find, like, how did you find

542
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:56,724
the jobs that like had the, sort
of the flexibility or the

543
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:59,474
cultures that you were looking
for? I mean, what they show up in

544
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:03,015
searches or was it more once you
were in, you know, once he began

545
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:05,444
dialogue, then it became clear,
you know,

546
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,804
Maeling: Yeah, that's a, that's a
great question. So I have to shut

547
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,235
out this site that I found during
my job search called

548
00:34:11,235 --> 00:34:15,885
keyvalues.io. Um, but they have a
section on their site called

549
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:19,659
culture queries. And you can
basically go through this like

550
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,440
tag cloud and select the
qualities that are most important

551
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,590
to you. So if you value pair
programming, if you value

552
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:31,480
flexible work hours, and so on.
And so I kind of used that as

553
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,349
springboard to start seeing what
companies were out there that

554
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,485
shared the same values that. And
so that's how I found, some of

555
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:43,425
these companies and then just
being active on Twitter. I'd

556
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:46,094
always see, you know, tweets
about different companies and

557
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:50,295
their culture. And so I just kept
a running list of companies, uh,

558
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:54,155
again, in a notion doc, come
running list of current. That I

559
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:58,954
wanted to investigate. And, um, I
had no problem reaching out to

560
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:03,244
employees on LinkedIn of those
companies to like, get a more

561
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:07,715
accurate you know, quotes, uh,
pulse of like what the culture is

562
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:13,804
actually like. uh, that's kind of
how I, I try to gauge, uh, you

563
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:17,695
know, the outside, looking in
what, uh, a company was actually

564
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:18,065
about.

565
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:21,724
Dan: Well, that's very cool. I
hadn't, that sounds like a great

566
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:25,744
tool. but now, now I want to
know, I want to know more about

567
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:28,355
your experience of, of reaching
out to people, you know, current

568
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:32,074
employees, uh, as a prospective
employee, you know, um, find

569
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:35,014
people in generally receptive to
that sort of thing? Uh, it's kind

570
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:36,425
of like a cold call situation,
right? I

571
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,869
Maeling: it was, yes, it was
exactly a cold call situation.

572
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:45,210
And, um, surprisingly, I wasn't
nervous about it. Just my whole

573
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,119
attitude in approaching software
engineering as a potential

574
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,585
career, I was just kind of. You
know, I'm just going to see where

575
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:54,704
this goes. If it doesn't end up
there, like I'm just going to

576
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:57,164
enjoy the process. I enjoy the
coding. And so that's how I

577
00:35:57,164 --> 00:36:01,335
approached like every step of
process and like securing a role.

578
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:04,125
And so when I was reaching out to
people, was friendly, it was

579
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:08,385
like, you know, um, Hey, I'm
interested more about your

580
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:11,565
company. If you have 15 minutes
to spare, would you mind hopping

581
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:16,010
on a quick chat chat call with me
to just discuss. What you enjoy

582
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,860
about working at such and such.
there were so many people who

583
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,110
responded back and gave like
really great advice and feedback

584
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,460
for my job search and even
referrals and like not even

585
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,570
asking for them. And so I, I was
pleasantly surprised to see. How

586
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,110
generous the people, um, were
when I reached out to them. And

587
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,159
like it extended to what I'd seen
within the tech, uh, community on

588
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,769
Twitter as well. I I've found
people to be very generous and

589
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:49,170
supportive. so to see that, you
know, off off of Twitter and in

590
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,199
other spaces like LinkedIn and,
you know, all of the developer

591
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,039
communities as well, it was just
very encouraging to see amount of

592
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,650
support, who's just trying to
transition into space.

593
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,659
Dan: That's very cool. It's cool
that it was a pretty positive

594
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,659
experience here, you know? Um,
yeah, I suppose you never know

595
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,800
when you. You know, when you
reach out to somebody that you

596
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,260
don't know. Um, um, and that's,
that's great. They had a

597
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,630
generally positive experience. It
makes me wonder if you ever had

598
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,719
anybody that was just like run
away. You don't

599
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:21,394
Bekah: I have had those

600
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:21,989
Dan: but that's just.

601
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,460
Bekah: Somebody, uh, on Twitter
saw I was going, that wasn't

602
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,250
applying for a company, but
somebody else I knew was. And so

603
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,750
I had posted about it and a DM
and they said, this is the most

604
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,889
toxic place I have ever worked.
And I'm afraid to say anything

605
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,550
out loud, because I think that
the retaliation would be so bad

606
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,469
that I might never have a career
in tech again, like, that is

607
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:54,869
horrifying. And it's hard cause
you just don't know it. What to

608
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:57,809
do with that information. At
least I didn't know what to do

609
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,920
with that information other than
to pass it along. Um, you know,

610
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,960
also one person's experience
might not be everybody else's. So

611
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:11,309
it's really trying to figure out,
I think, how to ask the right

612
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:12,849
questions too.

613
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,219
Maeling: Absolutely. Um, that's
such a great point because, uh,

614
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,070
like you said, it could
experience could even differ from

615
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,429
team to team within an
organization. So someone just

616
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,329
saying they had a negative
experience working at XYZ, it may

617
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,820
have been because of the specific
team and may have been because of

618
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,869
a specific manager, like you
never know. So ask all the

619
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,369
questions is my, my advice and
connect with as many people, you

620
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:41,280
know, working at the companies
that you're interested in just to

621
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:46,574
help you get more. A better sense
of what it would be like work

622
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,664
there. And of course you never
really know the full story until

623
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:53,025
you're actually working there.
But if you can clear as

624
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:57,364
information as possible to, to
help you make your decision, go

625
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:57,855
for it.

626
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:02,025
Bekah: Absolutely. I always take
down names of people and then I

627
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:06,385
check them out on social media. I
see what they're tweeting about.

628
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,985
I talked to somebody once and I
was talking about, well, you

629
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,315
know, I'll think about the, the
opportunity and then I'll get

630
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:16,094
back to you. I want to do some
more research and they're like,

631
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:20,235
okay, well I just posted a tweet.
I just tweeted. And I tagged

632
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,965
everyone in my team. So if you're
interested in knowing more about

633
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:26,385
the team, then everybody is right
there. Like, well, that makes it

634
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:30,344
easy. But, but I think that can
say like, even looking at their

635
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:33,525
interactions, I know this might
sound weird. It might sound

636
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:37,605
creepy, but I like to see how
people interact with each other.

637
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,724
And sometimes that's the only
glimpse that you get of it is

638
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:45,125
through social media, to be able
to see that. So I don't know. It,

639
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:48,164
it peels back the curtain a
little bit. I think that's not,

640
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:50,534
if you don't peel back, the
curtain pulls back like.

641
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:55,750
Dan: Mixing metaphors

642
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,510
Bekah: I am. I think I did it
earlier in Virtual Coffee too. I

643
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:06,750
was talking about peeling things.
I'm on appealing today. That

644
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,190
should have been our intro
question. Would you eat your

645
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:11,400
apple peeled or not peeled?

646
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:14,309
Dan: who its...

647
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:14,760
Bekah: a good one.

648
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,835
Maeling: I liked our question. I
liked our initial question.

649
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:27,905
Bekah: Peeled potatoes or not
peeled potatoes. Now I'm on a

650
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:34,655
kick. I should stop going with
this. Okay. Need to redirect my

651
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:41,344
brain. sorry. Um, this is what
happens to me at three o'clock

652
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,454
every day. My brain just starts
to lose it a little bit.

653
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:48,005
Dan: I feel like we made it 40
minutes before a full-on

654
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:49,114
sidetrack, you know, so

655
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:50,010
Maeling: That's pretty good.

656
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:51,605
Dan: it's pretty good for us.

657
00:40:56,175 --> 00:41:03,914
Bekah: Um, okay, so now you, you
are at this job now and what been

658
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:10,994
the biggest, I guess maybe what's
been most surprising about this

659
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:17,699
job or the things that you've
been happily surprised by since

660
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:18,289
starting.

661
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:23,744
Maeling: Oh man. Great question.
So I would have to save the

662
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:27,704
biggest thing that stood out to
me when starting my job is just

663
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:31,655
making that transition from
working on personal projects to

664
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:36,614
production level projects, with
massive code bases. Um, I

665
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:40,980
remember when I, when I first
looked at the. Hundreds of repos

666
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,829
I was a little overwhelmed and
wondered, like, how do you

667
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:50,190
approach this? Like during my
journey, I never saw a blog post

668
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,599
on to learn a massive code base
and start contributing to it

669
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,300
within a month. So I would say
that was definitely, something

670
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,590
that surprised me because I just
not, I had not seen that, level

671
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:11,679
of. Breadth in a code base before
at the production level. Um, and

672
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:15,510
on the other hand, what I was
pleasantly surprised with, uh,

673
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,340
was just the amount of, uh,
support across the organization,

674
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,949
not just within my team. Um, I am
really grateful at my job. They

675
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:30,900
have a very great onboarding
process. So when you come in,

676
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,920
you're matched with a new hire
buddy and that's someone who is

677
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,949
there for all of your initial
questions for like the first

678
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:41,940
several months that you're on the
job. And so when I had feelings

679
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,780
like, whoa, this is massive code
base, where do I even begin? I

680
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,500
already had someone I could just
reach out to without feeling any

681
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,135
shame or anything. And, you know,
just connect on that level and

682
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:56,414
then have them be able to connect
me with other people within the

683
00:42:56,414 --> 00:43:01,635
organization to help. So was
really surprising to me to just

684
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:07,275
have that kind of, uh, that level
of support just early on, um,

685
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:11,744
just a very welcoming, um,
environment. And I'm grateful for

686
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:15,195
that. That's, that's really
helped with me making this

687
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:15,585
transition.

688
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,510
Dan: So other than having
somebody that you can talk to you

689
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,644
to help, do you have any tips?
You know, now that you've got

690
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,215
your feet under you about diving
into a large code bases, you

691
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:29,025
know, for the first time.

692
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:35,195
Maeling: oh man. Yes. So I would
say one thing I, I would have

693
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:39,224
would recommend is. Contributing
to open source projects and

694
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:42,315
finding some that have large code
bases and digging into those

695
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:47,385
issues because uh, if you can
find one issue to work on within

696
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:50,414
a massive code base that will
give you an entry point into

697
00:43:50,414 --> 00:43:53,204
learning how the different pieces
connect, especially if they're

698
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:56,985
using, you know, other services,
cloud services that like, for me,

699
00:43:56,985 --> 00:44:00,164
I was not familiar with, um, a
lot of the cloud services and how

700
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:03,454
that integrates um, into the
architecture. And so if you can

701
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:05,945
find pro open source projects
like that, you know, if you're

702
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:10,054
learning right now start diving
to those issues, to just learn

703
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:14,135
how all of the pieces connect, I
feel like that will prepare you

704
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:17,914
immensely for, you know, moving
into a role where you have to do

705
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:19,155
that on the production level.

706
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:26,735
Dan: Great advice. I love that
advice very much. Um, that. That

707
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:30,454
not specifically open source.
That is usually my advice. When

708
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:33,994
the next question comes up is, is
find something small, you know,

709
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,565
in the code base, whatever, you
know, if it's the new code base

710
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:40,684
you're working in or, um,
whatever, find something small

711
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:42,844
and try to fit, just, you know,
start there and fix it. And

712
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:45,244
you'll start just to make the,
they make the connections. But,

713
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:51,074
um, I had never really connected
that. I mean, The practice of

714
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,065
contributing open source and
finding big projects, especially

715
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:57,965
to get used to this. Right. Cause
it's, it is like almost

716
00:44:57,965 --> 00:45:00,965
everything. Um, a thing that
we're we're practice makes, uh,

717
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:04,954
well, just helps you improve.
Right. And so, you know, having

718
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:09,335
been a developer for a while, you
know, I don't have like a lot of

719
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:13,355
anxiety jumping into a new code
base and that's not to say I

720
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:17,739
jumped into it. Know anything it.
Right. but I have the con, like,

721
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,130
I just have the experience of
having done it. A lot of times, I

722
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,090
just kind of, can I just trust
that I will be able to do it

723
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,409
because I've just done it, you
know? And yet you using an open

724
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:31,019
source for that and to prepare
yourself before you jump, like

725
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,989
before you get to your first job
where you know, you're going to

726
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:36,920
be, you know, dumped into a huge
code base because anybody that's

727
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,380
hiring, probably most people that
are hiring already have

728
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,280
something, you know what I mean?
And it's probably already a

729
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,429
giant... Well, I say giant mess
or... That'll depend, you know,

730
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:49,469
about how long, how long the
thing's been going on, but, you

731
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,480
know, there's a lot of giant
messes out there and that doesn't

732
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,449
mean they're bad. Uh, but they
can be very overwhelming, you

733
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:58,349
know? Um, I love that. I love
that advice about using open

734
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:00,690
source to like practice just that
specifically, you know,

735
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:04,179
Bekah: And I would add to that.
It can be challenging to get into

736
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,360
open source and finding issues
when you're starting out, but

737
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,565
people in your communities, like
in Virtual Coffee, Is there

738
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:15,644
anybody here that's running an
open source project. And if I

739
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:20,054
take an issue, will you help me
or Hey, I really want to, I want

740
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:25,014
to contribute to open source, but
I'm afraid to, would anybody be

741
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:29,864
there to pair up with me if I get
stuck and that can, or even just

742
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:33,264
to find the issues that can.
Reduce those barriers to entry

743
00:46:33,264 --> 00:46:37,405
because you have that support and
you can talk to people who maybe

744
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:42,485
have been in the code base or who
are used to diving into large

745
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:47,215
code bases and, and, and allow
them to, you know, kind of mentor

746
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:50,514
you through that, but to also
have the chance to communicate

747
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:54,914
with someone else, because the...
circling back to what you talked

748
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:57,525
about in the beginning. Like
being able to talk about what

749
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:02,235
you're doing is so hugely
important. And so if you think

750
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:06,375
you, well, I don't need help
diving into this code base. You

751
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:09,704
need practice talking about it if
you haven't, because that's,

752
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:13,005
that's a skill that a lot of us
don't get to develop when we're

753
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:14,465
learning mostly own.

754
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:18,809
Dan: I just, yeah, I just to add
to that, there's a lot of awesome

755
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:22,974
people in the developer community
that. Either for work or for

756
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:26,304
their own projects, you know,
maintain opensource projects like

757
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:30,143
this. Nick Taylor comes to mind
with Forem, which is a commercial

758
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:33,264
product, but it's open source.
And, um, he has, I mean, I've

759
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:36,474
watched him do it a million
times. He is always happy to like

760
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:40,384
help people and, and jump into
issues, you know, with the forum

761
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:45,134
code base. And I think any, any.
And that, and that's another good

762
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:49,003
example of a large scale, you
know, codebase, right. It's not a

763
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:53,353
simple app at all. Um, and he's,
you know, he's always very

764
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:56,623
generous with his time. And, um,
there's a lot of people like with

765
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,423
projects like that, that are
worth contributing to, you know,

766
00:47:58,724 --> 00:48:02,653
there's almost always people that
maintainers or, or, or, or

767
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:06,224
advocates or whoever, you know,
um, that I think, uh, reaching

768
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:09,943
out to you and would be excited,
you know, to, to help somebody

769
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:12,284
learn, you know, help somebody to
contribute to that, to that. I

770
00:48:12,284 --> 00:48:16,164
think. Um, what I was kind of
pushing open source here, Virtual

771
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,324
Coffee so if it fits in with the
theme.

772
00:48:19,878 --> 00:48:22,369
Bekah: Yeah, absolutely. Nick
just came to my live stream that

773
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,699
I did before this and as doing
TensorFlow JS stuff and I

774
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:28,489
couldn't even get it running and
he's, he's there debugging it. He

775
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:33,978
does. He's not done TensorFlow JS
before, but you know, he, he is

776
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,759
there to be supportive and to
help work through things that,

777
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:42,628
uh, I don't even know where to
start right now because I, that

778
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:49,179
error. Is, means nothing, nothing
to me. So, you know, it's just

779
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:53,159
nice to have people there and to
build that community because you

780
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:59,159
can be part of the community
building aspect of things. Um, so

781
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:04,588
as you kind of look forward into
your future, do you think that

782
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:08,759
you'll continue to value? Or are
there lessons that you've learned

783
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:15,009
over the last you know, year or
so you're hoping to take with you

784
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:16,179
or to grow with.

785
00:49:17,844 --> 00:49:22,119
Maeling: Awesome question. At the
top of my mind, I feel like one

786
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:25,748
of the things I want to continue
developing is just that

787
00:49:25,748 --> 00:49:32,139
connection to community. Um, it's
just so integral to development,

788
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:36,099
no matter what industry you're in
it just makes life more

789
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:40,059
meaningful as well. I, I value,
you know, genuine personal

790
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:44,449
connections and being able to
grow alongside others who have

791
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:48,653
similar goals and visions is
priceless to me. So that's,

792
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:54,164
that's something I highly value
and will always striving to do

793
00:49:54,264 --> 00:49:59,153
develop more. And as far as like
looking into the future, I, I

794
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:03,653
want to, at some point be more
active in sharing more of the

795
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:08,003
knowledge that I'm learning, um,
to just help others, because that

796
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:10,554
was so priceless to me on the
other side, when I was learning

797
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,733
from others. And so I want to be
able to give back in that way, I

798
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:19,554
feel like I still need to get
this work-life balance situation

799
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:22,134
together before I start pouring
energy into that. But that's

800
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:24,893
definitely the horizon and
something that I would be

801
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:27,574
passionate about contributing
towards.

802
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:32,844
Bekah: well, you got the notes,
so always

803
00:50:32,914 --> 00:50:33,594
Maeling: the notes are there.

804
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:36,893
Bekah: They're there. Well, thank
you Maeling so much for being

805
00:50:36,893 --> 00:50:42,474
here with us today. This was very
awesome. And I have learned a

806
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:45,824
lot. And so, yeah, thanks so
much.

807
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:48,938
Maeling: Um, my pleasure really
enjoyed chatting with you all.

808
00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:52,619
Dan: Yeah, thanks. Maeling all
right. We will, uh, yeah, I guess

809
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,318
we'll talk to you. I don't know
where the sentence is going. I'm

810
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,889
sorry. I totally lost the whole
thing, man. I made it almost the

811
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,898
whole way without totally
imploding. Bekah you say by, this

812
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:05,159
is the part, this is the part
where

813
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:07,503
Bekah: We're not good at saying
goodbye. So you

814
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:08,228
Dan: Every, every time.

815
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:10,204
Bekah: we usually stare at
eachother awkwardly or something.

816
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,668
So thanks Maeling, bye.

817
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:28,447
