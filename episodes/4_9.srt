00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:14,819
that

4
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:18,449
features members of the Virual
Coffee community. Virtual Coffee

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,754
is an intimate group of
developers at all stages of

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,059
their

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,088
coding journey. they're here on
this podcast, sharing their

8
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:25,663
stories and what they've
learned. And we're here to share

9
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,238
it with

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,998
you. with me today, is my
cohost, Dan.

11
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:35,298
Dan: Thanks Bekah, this is the
final episode of season four. So

12
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:40,009
as is traditional, now we have
with us Kirk TK Shillingford

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:45,378
himself. Um, and you know, you
all know Kirk, he's a maintainer

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,928
of Virtual Coffee and a long
time member and, uh, obviously a

15
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,478
great

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,191
person and, uh, we're we're
gonna kind of today. Talk a

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,843
little bit

18
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:58,304
about the last year, but, um,
what we've done, a Virtual

19
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:02,234
Coffee, we just wrapped up
Hacktoberfest and we are into

20
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,763
our, uh, November monthly
challenge, which we'll talk

21
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,292
about

22
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:08,743
a little bit. And, um, what kind
of just, I don't know, hang out

23
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:11,024
and chat for awhile. It's a
little bit different format than

24
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:13,694
usual, but, um, it's kind of a
fun way to wrap up the season

25
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:16,394
and, uh, yeah,

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,518
Bekah: So we're going to start
this episode of the podcast.

27
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:19,793
Like

28
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:24,084
we start every Virtual Coffee
with our name, where we're from

29
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:28,284
what we do and a random check-in
question. We hope you enjoy this

30
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:34,230
episode. Today's random check-in
question. Is, would you rather

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:40,176
be

32
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:44,467
able to run at 100 miles per
hour or fly at 10 miles per

33
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:48,757
hour? So

34
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:55,777
I'm Bekah. a front end developer
from a small town in Ohio and to

35
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,756
fly at 10 miles per hour would
be cool, but I'm like terrified

36
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,735
of

37
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,307
flying. I don't like it at all.
I think I'm going to stay on the

38
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,876
ground and I'm going to run a
hundred miles per.

39
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:12,956
Dan: All right. All right. Um, I
am Dan, I do computer stuff from

40
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:20,247
Cleveland and, uh, yeah. Um, I
don't know. I, you know, you get

41
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,642
into these questions and then
you start, like, I need to know

42
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,037
a

43
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:25,646
little more details. You know,
the running a hundred miles per

44
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,757
hour sort of situation is like,
okay. So like, if you ran a

45
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,727
hundred per, like right now, one
of us just started running a

46
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,796
hundred miles per hour, your
shoes would explode instantly,

47
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,236
you know, would your feet

48
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,822
Bekah: they, is that true? Has
that been tested

49
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,787
Dan: I don't know about
instantly, but like they would,

50
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,901
well, I mean, I guess if you
only ran for 30 seconds or

51
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,686
something,

52
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,142
then maybe that's fine, you
know, but if you ran a hundred

53
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:48,597
miles in

54
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:50,321
your shoes at one time, maybe
they'd be fine. They're not

55
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,045
going

56
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,816
to be able to do it twice shoes
aren't built like that, you

57
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,586
know?

58
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,426
So you'd have to get some
special

59
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,912
Bekah: Bare feet. This is what
I'm talking

60
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:58,991
Dan: Bare feet. All right.

61
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,956
Bekah: In your bare feet. some
calluses, your a hundred miles

62
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,891
an

63
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,282
hour.

64
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,412
Dan: I think I'm still gonna
choose flying at 10 miles an

65
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:07,617
hour. Uh, you know, that's a
faster pace than, uh, you know,

66
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,822
a

67
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,882
general run. I mean, it's not
faster pace than like a

68
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,621
professional sprinter, but it is
a faster pace than any, you

69
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,360
know,

70
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,821
sort of running in general. And,
uh, so plus flying, you know,

71
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,221
you

72
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:24,431
can cut corners, obviously you
can go, but you don't have to

73
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,741
stick to, you know,

74
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,301
Bekah: Go over mountains.

75
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:31,542
Dan: right. Over mountains, over
houses, over traffic jams, et

76
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,162
cetera. So I'm doing fine. Plus
I actually like heights and I

77
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:34,782
like

78
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,602
being able to see stuff and even
just being able to like go

79
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:38,757
straight up into the air and
like look around and then come

80
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:39,912
back

81
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:45,622
down. That that'd be my jam. So
I'm choosing the flying option.

82
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:46,372
Bekah: Alright Kirk, What doyou
have?

83
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:52,081
Kirk: Oh it's my turn. Um, all
right. My name's Kirk, um,

84
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,991
software developer from the
Caribbean. Uh, this is not,

85
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,781
there

86
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,942
was no question here. It's a
hundred percent fly. There was

87
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:02,442
no, other option is silly.

88
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,877
Bekah: Everyone picks on me on
these questions. I need to find

89
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,137
better questions. I think.

90
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:10,906
Kirk: The average human running
speed is 10 to 15 miles per

91
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:12,210
hour.

92
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:17,461
So I could just fly as fast as I
run now. And everywhere where I

93
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,132
live is like Hills, right? It's
always a hill. So if I had to

94
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,842
run, just like zigzagging all
the way down the mountain,

95
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,552
whereas I

96
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:30,841
could just fly down. You know,
you can do a just flight, you

97
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,461
know, it's flight,

98
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:35,891
Dan: I'm with you. It's like, if
you.

99
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,091
Kirk: You can take like, groups
and stuff,

100
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,012
Dan: Look at any map directions
and the route to anywhere you go

101
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:44,072
is all sorts of zig zags and
curves and all that stuff. Even

102
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,961
on an interstate. But if you're
flying, you don't have to worry

103
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,411
about any of that.

104
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,677
Bekah: Well, I mean like
rollercoasters are fun, Right.

105
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,646
Cause you go very fast up and
down Hills,

106
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,451
Dan: But you could still go on
coasters.

107
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,586
Kirk: That's the biggest roller
coaster I've ever heard.

108
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,786
Bekah: All right. I feel like I
lost. And this is an

109
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,406
introduction

110
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:14,706
question. Well, I suppose I'm
going to try harder the rest of

111
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,237
this podcast episode.

112
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:20,396
Kirk: Flying and like a pigeon
just like smacks me and Dan in

113
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:23,716
the face feel a lot better. Like
we'll really eat our words, you

114
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:23,916
know?

115
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:24,447
Dan: Yeah.

116
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:26,347
Bekah: I'll just, I'll, I'll run
to you as quickly as possible.

117
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,817
So

118
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,916
can take the emergency room.

119
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,451
Dan: Yeah. But you can't run to
Kirk cause he's on an island,

120
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,741
but

121
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:33,672
we could fly.

122
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,617
Bekah: If you're running a
hundred miles an hour, you can

123
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,036
just run on water that
scientifically proven.

124
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,036
Dan: And you,

125
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:39,997
Kirk: I mean,

126
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:43,591
Dan: is that the, is that the,
that's the speed at which you

127
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,612
just stay on top of the water?
suppose you got, uh,

128
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,516
Bekah: 100... 99 I think maybe.
So I've got

129
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,862
Dan: If you could run a hundred
miles per hour, probably you

130
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:54,841
could like, hang your feet over
a boat and then you know, like,

131
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,371
well, this is like in, um, in
Incredibles, right? So it's

132
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,901
like,

133
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,322
uh,

134
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,122
Bekah: leg

135
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,091
Dan: there. Yeah.

136
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,502
Bekah: that's what it's about

137
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:05,221
Dan: And he did skim across at
least a small pond. So,

138
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,266
Kirk: No. They're like you pick
this running it, but won't help

139
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,396
you with your favorite thing,
which is box jumps

140
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,216
Bekah: Well, it, it will not
help me to jump higher. guess if

141
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,081
you

142
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:19,932
get a good running start, then
maybe

143
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,572
Dan: Then you'll just crash into
the box though. The, your Crash

144
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,101
Kirk: the box??

145
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:24,572
Bekah: why am I going, to crash
into the box?

146
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:28,581
Dan: Your momentum will be going
forward. Well, then you'll fly

147
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,781
over the box. And I suppose

148
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:33,252
Bekah: So then I'm flying at 12
miles an hour And I beat be you.

149
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:35,771
Kirk: Uh,

150
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:41,641
Bekah: Welcome to all our new
listeners out there. It's just a

151
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:44,201
podcast about developer
communities.

152
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:45,672
Dan: And goodbye to all of our
oldest.

153
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,351
Kirk: Now they know what they're
in there for

154
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:49,422
Dan: Yeah, that's true.

155
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:50,112
Bekah: Um,

156
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:53,771
Dan: I was honestly hoping for
some sort of fantasy or, you

157
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,711
know, comic book related
questions so we can try to make

158
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,411
Kirk cry on air.

159
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:02,296
Kirk: You know, No, Bryan was
here the last time and you

160
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,191
didn't

161
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,271
mention these like the biggest
Lord of the Rings, Like

162
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:09,350
nerd-fan.

163
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,391
You could have totally, you
know,

164
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,072
Dan: That's true. I forgot about
that. Yeah.

165
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,482
Bekah: Yeah.

166
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,891
Dan: I could have really poked
at him for two.

167
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:25,891
Bekah: I think Bryan, Bryan, um,
can, uh, get out of control

168
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,436
pretty easily though. So we were
trying make this in the PG

169
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:30,981
range.

170
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:31,541
Dan: That's true.

171
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:32,322
Kirk: And

172
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:32,927
Dan: That's

173
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:34,211
Kirk: He did really well.

174
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:41,747
Dan: I only had to edit out like
three curse words. I think the

175
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:42,826
first time we had to do that.

176
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:46,512
Bekah: We had decisions about
what was appropriate to stay.

177
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:49,882
Kirk: I found out that PG 13,
you get one F-bomb.

178
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:53,492
Bekah: Yes you do do but there
are certain contexts you may not

179
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,411
use it in. So how you use it
also impacts whether or not you

180
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:57,330
get

181
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:01,951
that one. The more, you know,

182
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,156
Dan: Valuable information.

183
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,176
Bekah: Uh, okay. So I thought
today it would be good to when

184
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,035
we

185
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:10,121
have Virtual Coffee every
Tuesday and Thursday, do, um,

186
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,206
everybody

187
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:15,447
comes into the big Zoom room and
then we go into breakout rooms

188
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,037
and we usually have eight to 10
people in the breakout rooms

189
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,627
with

190
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:22,797
a room leader note taker. And we
always have a back pocket topic.

191
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:24,596
And we do that to make sure that
if nobody has something they

192
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,335
want

193
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:31,466
to talk about or bring up that
we, go ahead and have something

194
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:36,386
prepared. And so I pulled from
our back pocket topics for this

195
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,246
episode, because I think it
makes sense in the context of

196
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,106
what we

197
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,161
have been doing over the past
couple of months. And so the,

198
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:44,216
our

199
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,157
back pocket topic that we have
talked about before in Virtual

200
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:49,884
Coffee with open source
software, We talked about the

201
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:52,611
most painful

202
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,666
barriers to entry for open
source contributions, how to

203
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,721
reduce

204
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:01,042
those barriers favorite open
source repos to contribute to.

205
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,337
since we just wrapped, wrapped
up Hacktoberfest, I thought it

206
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,032
would

207
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:09,351
be good to, jump into this and
see what we've learned. Uh, two

208
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:13,432
years of doing Hacktoberfest
initiatives with a community. If

209
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,766
we've learned anything more
about this or what we think. So

210
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:18,100
who

211
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,971
wants to get the conversation
started?

212
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:27,177
Dan: Um, I'll go, uh, you know,
I, I think my, my biggest lesson

213
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:32,517
and it was a lesson that I, it
took me a bit to learn the first

214
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:36,326
time. Right. And it really
solidified this last time is

215
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:42,297
that, um, open source is, you
know, you, you use the phrase

216
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,186
painful barriers to entry,
right? And that, that like that

217
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,075
barrier

218
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:51,236
to entry exists for everybody
that hasn't done it yet. And not

219
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,777
just, um, not just new
developers, uh, experienced

220
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,807
developers, you know, people
who've been writing code,

221
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:58,946
writing, building websites,
doing all this stuff for years

222
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,085
and

223
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,561
years and years, if they
haven't, uh, you know, up until

224
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,036
they do it

225
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,576
for the first time, uh, they,
there is there's this barrier,

226
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:15,287
you know, and there's a whole
world of, um, you know, Unknowns

227
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:17,897
and that that's like, that's
been, the biggest thing for me

228
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,847
is, is the unknowns and, and
providing support for that

229
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,797
right.

230
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:25,336
Is, is kind of whatever, what
I've, you know, what we've made

231
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:30,976
our goal. Um, there's technical
things to know, you know, um,

232
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:36,106
there's all the Git stuff and
merging and all that stuff. And

233
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:39,226
then there's Git Hub technical
stuff on top of that, right? How

234
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:42,647
pull requests actually work and
forking, which is a huge, you

235
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:47,897
know, a ball of stuff to figure
out. Um, but then there's the

236
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,341
social aspect of it, which I,
you know, which I found

237
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,336
personally,

238
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:54,796
like that was my biggest
barrier, you know, getting into

239
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,986
open

240
00:10:56,986 --> 00:11:00,976
source, uh, in the first place
was the sort of anxiety around,

241
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:04,277
um, you know, jumping into this
thing with people you don't know

242
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,344
on, um, Even if I feel confident
in my ability to write a piece

243
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:10,381
of

244
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,811
code or whatever it is, you
know, for the task, like, like

245
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,241
there's

246
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,662
still a large space of
possibility to embarrass myself,

247
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,571
you know, for one, for one
thing. Uh, right. And you know

248
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,551
how like

249
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:31,052
so-so figuring out how to, um,
how to find ways to contribute

250
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:34,261
and how to be more comfortable
with it. And it's honestly that

251
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,516
there's, uh, there's we can
write and talk about all the

252
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,720
different,

253
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:42,091
like possibilities and different
things to look into, but let's

254
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:46,591
like, get just diving in is
really, it's like breaking the

255
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:50,581
seal kind of right. It's like,
you know, once you start getting

256
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,547
doing it a little bit, it
becomes much easier every, every

257
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,152
time.

258
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:58,601
Uh, so that's, that's been my,
like, that's been my big. Lesson

259
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:01,111
is, is like remembering that
this is hard and it's hard for

260
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,741
anybody, uh, who hasn't done it
before. It's hard for, I mean,

261
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:06,106
it's still hard, even if you
have done it before it, you

262
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:07,381
know, if

263
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:08,896
you're, if you're trying to join
a new project or whatever for

264
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,411
the

265
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,107
first time. Um, but that's, I
don't know. That's been the

266
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,802
thing

267
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,081
that's been the back of my mind
for all, all of our stuff that

268
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:18,151
we've, that we've been doing.
Um, I feel like we've helped,

269
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,221
but you

270
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:22,831
know, that's anyway, that's,
that's my main, that's my main,

271
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:27,241
uh, I don't know, lesson, I
guess that I think about it.

272
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:33,386
Bekah: Yeah. And I, when I saw
those barriers too, with some of

273
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:37,437
my mentees, both of them I think
were first-time contributors.

274
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,136
And, one of them picked up a
first timer, an issue for a

275
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,325
first

276
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:48,917
timer it didn't. Go into the
issue and describe the whole

277
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:55,187
process that was required even
commit or to run the project. So

278
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,907
she had to learn about Docker.
She had to learn about test

279
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:03,527
writing there were all of these
things that I'm like, I, I am

280
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:06,047
going to do my best to help you,
but I've never done any of these

281
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,162
things and it's not spelled out
in the issue either. And she,

282
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,277
she

283
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,016
really pushed through it and did
an amazing job and reached out

284
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,755
to

285
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,116
this, their Discord community to
get some help. But I just

286
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,297
thought, wow, that's really
overwhelming to jump into it.

287
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:23,492
And, the way that it was, um,
phrased seemed like it would be

288
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:26,687
a

289
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:32,897
fairly simple issue. And it
turned out to be really in depth

290
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,736
and required a lot of different
pieces that weren't laid out in

291
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,971
the issue. And so like that,
like those kinds of things are

292
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:41,206
always

293
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:48,091
something that. I am surprised
by, especially for, um, w and

294
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:53,251
repositories that have a lot of
people contributing, not having

295
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:58,442
clearly written documentation.
It continually surprises me.

296
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:08,386
Kirk: Um, I'm not sure. I mean,
I do wish that there was a

297
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:13,907
standardization of the language,
but I feel like part of it is,

298
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:19,336
you know, even with we're doing
reviews for like PRS and issues

299
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,307
coming in, but then there's that
question of, you know, like who

300
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:26,027
reviews the review? So it's,
it's, you know, if you're a

301
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,467
person submitting a pull
request, then someone will take

302
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,907
a look at

303
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:32,147
it and get feedback and give
comments. But if you're the

304
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,777
person writing the issue, you
know, do you get that same

305
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:37,951
treatment? And I think I can
really highlights even. you

306
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,125
know,

307
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,787
like we discovered that when
contributing as a solo endeavor,

308
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,692
it's just like way, way harder
for all these reasons. Right.

309
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,567
But

310
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,537
when maintaining as a solo
endeavor, it's also super

311
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:53,986
difficult. Cause you, you know,
it's not like someone's born. If

312
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:57,197
I can intimate knowledge about
how to present issues for people

313
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:01,096
to fix. And if you don't have a
support structure or you don't

314
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:04,006
have people who can review your
work, I feel like it's just so

315
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,197
much more likely that these
things happen and a maintainer

316
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,687
might not even know. They're
like, oh, you know, this is

317
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,027
enough context to solve this
problem. And it might take us on

318
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,527
us, but like it's enough context
given. And then there's a list

319
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,027
of

320
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:17,177
givens. it. And this person
understands Docker, given this

321
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,376
person understands, get this
person understands our code

322
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,575
base.

323
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:22,569
And there's like a whole, know,
Um, yeah, I think like my, my

324
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,562
big

325
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:31,981
takeaway was just that, um,
community helps with community

326
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:36,182
helps with like every stage, you
know, and we did encounter a lot

327
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:40,442
of maintainers who were like, I
don't even know if my project is

328
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:44,312
inviting. Is this welcoming or
not? You know, what should I be

329
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:47,987
doing? Um, even internally in
VC, you know, it's, you always

330
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:51,662
feel

331
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:54,391
better. Um, if at least one
other person has a chance to

332
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,120
just, even

333
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,036
if you think like, well, I know
what I'm doing, it's just good

334
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:58,951
to

335
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:01,591
get some lift. Yeah. That looks
good. Or I think that's a good

336
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:08,861
idea. Or maybe tweak this. Like,
it just, it helps so much. So I

337
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:12,892
feel like that was the big
takeaway. And last year we were

338
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,172
like, oh, it takes a lot of work
to do this. And like this year

339
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:17,686
it's still like, oh, it does.
Like, I don't know. It's and

340
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,720
this

341
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:25,756
year was amazing. But it just
sort of like reinforced how much

342
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:31,216
effort is required. And like, I
think a DigitalOcean, know, put

343
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:34,697
in a lot of work, they updated
the site, you know, they took

344
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,366
some feedback from last year,
they made changes. They had a

345
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,181
fact like they, you know, they
went all in, but there were

346
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,996
still

347
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:43,351
gaps and that's not like a, they
didn't do lot. It's like,

348
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,706
there's

349
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:50,297
still just so much here because
ultimately we're telling people,

350
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,696
Hey, you should try to
contribute to a project in the

351
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,615
tech space.

352
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,152
And the tech space is massive
and it's almost impossible to

353
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,657
find

354
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:04,606
somebody has exactly the right
set of tools to completely help

355
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,666
you through something. So it's
this weird mismatch of

356
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:14,086
documentation, support, and
spawns time from the maintainers

357
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,152
access to resources. And
hopefully it all comes together

358
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:20,852
in a way that someone can make a
contribution and feel like

359
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:25,051
they've, they've done some good
quality work, but it's so easy

360
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,631
for one of those at least one to
be missing. then, you know,

361
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,211
that,

362
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,582
that resistance that Dan
describes just like, then it's

363
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:37,201
like, I just, if I'm not sure I
can do a good job on this, you

364
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,571
know, am I getting paid for
this? Like, I'm not making

365
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:41,941
mistakes for

366
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:47,392
free. So I think that's like my,
uh, my take.

367
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:52,727
Dan: Yeah, I would, I mean, I
would say that's my other main,

368
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:56,626
the main thing, especially that
solidified this, this year also

369
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:59,507
was the, the, the other side of
it, you know what I mean? Like

370
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:04,487
coming from the maintainers
perspective and, um, you know,

371
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,421
part of it is what I was saying
was like, you know, learning

372
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,325
that

373
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,166
all of this stuff is hard and
trying to make your repository,

374
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:19,007
um, uh, open and available and
welcoming for an entire audience

375
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:23,297
of, you know, entire spectrum
of, uh, technical level and, you

376
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,691
know, experience and all that
stuff, uh, is, is really a

377
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,085
really

378
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,676
hard, it's a hard balance to
strike. And, you know, do you,

379
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,266
if

380
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:32,701
you're a maintainer of a
project, you know, Take on the

381
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,411
responsibility of teaching every
single potential contributor,

382
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,121
how

383
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:40,142
to use Git, you know, for
instance, um, or how to use

384
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:44,071
anything, how to use Docker, you
know what I mean? Like the, like

385
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:48,031
you would like, I, I, the bare
minimum on honestly, would be

386
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,632
whatever command, you know, like
I imagined Bekah, the one that

387
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,431
you, the project you were
talking about, like had some,

388
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,230
just like

389
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,902
go install Docker, and then run
this command, you know, and then

390
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:04,892
move on. Right. Like that would
be, um, and that, like, that

391
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:09,481
assumes, uh, assumes some amount
of knowledge and ability to

392
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:11,537
download things and configure
things, and also assumes that

393
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:12,662
you

394
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:16,231
remembered all of the stuff you
did when you set up the project.

395
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:17,986
Right. Which is like very hard
to do. And then I think,

396
00:19:17,986 --> 00:19:19,741
correct.

397
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,372
What you said was what, like you
run into, uh, as a maintainer,

398
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:26,882
you know, lots of times somebody
might try to contribute, have a

399
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,662
problem, not be able to find an
answer and give up, you'll never

400
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:33,707
know, Right. Yeah. You'll never
know about it. And so that is

401
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,767
like one of the reasons why we
wanted to try to provide support

402
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,581
for maintainers, you know, and
we did that last year and this

403
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,395
year,

404
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:47,507
you know, um, and is, is helping
maintainers, um, you know,

405
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,717
provide, you know, provide
information for the repositories

406
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:54,166
and get some extra sets of eyes
just on. Okay. Like what, what,

407
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,376
what does a person actually have
to do to install this, you know,

408
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:01,277
on their computer? What happens
if they're on windows? You know,

409
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,912
like all, all of this stuff and
maintainers don't have time.

410
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,547
Most

411
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,586
of maintainers don't have time
for any of that stuff, you know,

412
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,221
it's, it's so hard to do. Um,
and so that's the other side of

413
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,856
it

414
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:15,457
and it's like, I, I would
honestly. I've been thinking

415
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:19,987
recently in, in, you know, in my
own retrospective about

416
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:24,186
Hacktoberfest about whether we
should maybe have a maintainer,

417
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:27,967
like an OSS maintainer thing.
That's not Hacktoberfest, you

418
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,156
know? Cause it's so hard for us
to, um, you know, we have all,

419
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:32,345
we

420
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,561
have lots of, lots of people
that were excited about

421
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:34,776
contributing

422
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:36,846
and it was amazing, you know?
And I, I feel like we in

423
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,915
preparing

424
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:43,116
for all of that, you know, could
have, I mean, we could spend a

425
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,386
whole month just on helping
people,

426
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:47,201
Bekah: I mean, we kind do, you
know?

427
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,186
Dan: Well, yeah,

428
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,634
Bekah: With preptember, we have
a whole list, but mean, I'm

429
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:50,981
right.

430
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:55,781
there with you. I think, know,
providing that, providing very

431
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,566
active support to maintainers.
Cause I think that, especially

432
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,290
if

433
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,592
you're a first time maintainer
it's, you don't realize the

434
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,652
amount of work that goes into
writing a good issue or having

435
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:08,142
the documentation or the labels
and stuff that you need. And

436
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,632
then

437
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:15,132
there's not clear instructions
for what that looks like either.

438
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:18,161
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And it
it'll look different depending

439
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,990
on

440
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:24,971
your project. And, you know, if
it's like, Kirk has the Cordo

441
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,311
game, right. And so that's like
its own sort of, uh, it's a

442
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:29,621
game.

443
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:31,662
Right. You know, so you can
download it, install it and run

444
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:35,682
it and all that stuff. And, but
some people have, um, projects

445
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:38,261
that are packages, you know,
that are dependencies for other

446
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,951
things, you know? And, uh, so
that like how much, like if you

447
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,061
make it React component, for
instance, as an open source

448
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:49,751
thing. Um, and there's a million
examples of that out there. You

449
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,926
know, how much like teaching
about React? Do you put into

450
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:54,101
your

451
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,651
documentation for your thing?
You know, it reminds me of, um,

452
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,811
we,

453
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:02,021
we talked with Jessica, I guess
this will be a couple of weeks

454
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:07,182
ago when this one comes out and,
um, you know, she does... a

455
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,576
really good job writing
articles. And we talked a lot

456
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,970
about, um,

457
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:15,071
how to, how to like set that
level of, um, expectations for

458
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:17,892
when you're reading which in her
case it was tutorials and things

459
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:20,352
like tech tech articles, but it
applies, I think, to

460
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,912
documentation too, you know? And
so one of the things she tries

461
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:23,442
to

462
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,011
do is, um, as either, if she's
not going to deep dive into

463
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:30,192
everything, you know, she'll,
she'll add some steps of a

464
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,442
prerequisite she calls them at
the, at the beginning of the

465
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,196
article and I think that's a
great, like a great resource,

466
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,950
uh,

467
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:39,162
you know, to do. And I, and I've
been thinking about it a lot at

468
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,096
applying to documentation as
well. Right. So prerequisites

469
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:42,731
for

470
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:46,271
this package, you know, um, read
about React or whatever, you

471
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:50,531
know, uh, uh, this package, it
depends on the useEffect hook.

472
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,172
Here's like three blog posts
about it or something like that,

473
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,251
you know, for example, you

474
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:56,916
Bekah: yeah, I feel I mean, you
can even make that an issue for

475
00:22:56,916 --> 00:23:00,967
somebody, To add that to your
documentation. How does somebody

476
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:04,086
get here from different levels
or what are the resources people

477
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:04,777
could use?

478
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:08,912
Dan: Yeah, absolutely. And we
say, you know, lots of times

479
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:13,932
it's, uh, one of those, like, I
don't know, tricky teachery

480
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:16,471
answers, but you know, oh, like
I couldn't figure out how this

481
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:21,301
project works and then I figured
it out. And so, so somebody will

482
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,791
just say, okay, we'll make, make
a pull request and fix the docs.

483
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:27,932
You know what I mean? And it's
like, I dunno, I always feel

484
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:30,006
snarky, you know, um, saying
that to somebody who's, who's

485
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,070
still

486
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:33,602
learning and new to this, but
improving documentation is one

487
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:35,102
of

488
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:39,571
those things that, um,
maintainers, I think will almost

489
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,211
always welcome, you know, at at
least welcome to the discussion

490
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,192
and, um, I don't know.

491
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:47,291
Bekah: I added a number of
issues, I think, to repos this

492
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,046
year for that documentation
issue and told other people to

493
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,801
do it

494
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:56,172
too, And said, you know, you are
stuck on this. So somebody else

495
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:57,836
who wants to contribute will be
stuck on it as well. If you

496
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,351
raise

497
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:01,286
an issue on somebody takes on
the documentation, you're

498
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,220
helping

499
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:06,852
next people that are coming
towards coming to work on this

500
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:08,727
project and enriching the
community. And, know, I just

501
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,602
hope

502
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:15,491
that those kinds of things get
raised too. And recognizing you

503
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:19,991
can add an issue having to do
the PR yourself.

504
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:21,332
Dan: on yes

505
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,926
Bekah: But just making people
aware. Cause sometimes if you've

506
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:26,911
been in it for so long, it's
hard to remember that you have

507
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:29,896
to go

508
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,067
through all of these steps.

509
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,951
Dan: How were those received,
where those on those were other

510
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,031
than other people's projects?

511
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:38,116
Bekah: Yeah. So I got a couple
of messages just asking for a

512
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:39,796
little

513
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,566
bit more clear. Some of them
were just like, I need to put

514
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,335
this

515
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:46,606
down. I was doing them from my
phone, which makes it a little

516
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:51,136
bit more difficult, but I do use
the Git Hub app a lot. Um, and

517
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:54,227
so, you know, talking through,
okay, well these are the things

518
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,222
like, and in some were as simple
as it would be really. helpful

519
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:58,217
if

520
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:04,457
you had a form for, um, issues.
So you can select the different

521
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:07,576
type of issue just to make it
clearer, to add labeling, really

522
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:10,696
click quickly and for people to
look through things. And so,

523
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:14,656
know, some were receptive, some
didn't respond and you know, I

524
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:18,106
just, my best to improve
documentation this year.

525
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:21,136
Dan: well, there's only so much
you can do as a, as a individual

526
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:23,221
contributor. And, you know,
we've all said it, but it's a

527
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,306
lot of

528
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,057
work as a maintainer. And so if
you make a issue or make a pull

529
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:33,257
request and it doesn't, I don't
know, it just gets ignored or

530
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:35,446
whatever. I just gotta remember
that there's people on the other

531
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:38,237
end then. Um, I don't know. It's
hard lots of times,

532
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:45,852
Kirk: Yeah, I think, well, the
context of, um, this is people

533
00:25:45,882 --> 00:25:47,951
donating their free time, but
attempting to help people

534
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:55,471
donating their free time, and
like, if it works ways. Um, it's

535
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,981
sort of like, it's good to keep
empathy when you're dealing with

536
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:04,981
someone who is maybe like
confused or as like a lot of

537
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,082
questions. Cause like, Hey, this
person is like literally trying

538
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:09,122
to help me for free. Um, it
works the other way. Cause

539
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:11,162
sometimes,

540
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:14,311
you know, I will send a message
to a repo maintainer and they

541
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:16,711
won't respond and then I'll
eventually be, and I'm like, you

542
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,361
know, also this is like not
their job and it's also not my

543
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,011
job, you

544
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,556
know? Like we're all we give it
a shot. And then like

545
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:23,101
ultimately,

546
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:27,872
which, which is, I think why
it's such a valuable thing for

547
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:32,642
developers at all levels, you
know, it's, it's a very low

548
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:38,672
stakes way to do something good.
To get more experience, to build

549
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:44,372
community, to, you know, explore
spaces you'd like to try before,

550
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:47,882
like, and you know, like that's
like, that's our motivation. We,

551
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:50,396
we genuinely think.
Contributing, oh, sources of

552
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,771
good thing to do,

553
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:57,721
or at least to try. Um, there's
many things. Like I would not

554
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:02,942
have the opportunity necessarily
to have done in like workplaces,

555
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:04,321
but that's okay because I can do
it in an open source

556
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,550
environment.

557
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,006
I can still get that practice
and that experience, but, you

558
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:08,461
know,

559
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,236
that's the key thing is like,
you know, we're, we're trying to

560
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:13,800
do

561
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:21,451
our best, everyone's trying, so
like, you know, if people can't

562
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,551
or they have to take as long as,
as long as like being a jerk,

563
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:28,382
don't be a jerk. If you're
listening out there, don't be a

564
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:32,686
jerk. know, not you, you, um,
but it's also okay to say, um, I

565
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:36,990
have

566
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,561
a lot on my plate right now, or
this is a little overwhelming or

567
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:46,352
I don't have the bandwidth for
it. Uh, a couple of my mentees

568
00:27:46,352 --> 00:27:48,991
were like, Hey, this is actually
a super busy month for me. I'm

569
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:52,531
like, that's, it's okay. You
know, like these repos will be

570
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:56,412
around after hacktberfest. I'll
be around after Hacktoberfest,

571
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:59,312
you know, like, uh, PR is just
as good in month, know, this

572
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:02,192
month

573
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:05,852
is like, it, it gets the
community going, but know, like

574
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,821
people have in Virtual Coffee is
going to be like, ask me next

575
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:14,521
year. You know? So I think like
that, it's also like important

576
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:20,741
to, I especially say that as
somebody who spent a lot of time

577
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:26,471
this month, like I didn't get to
submit many things to other

578
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,142
repos, not as much as I wanted
to, but.

579
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:34,382
Dan: Yeah, no, it is okay. And
it's like, yeah, we, I mean, we

580
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:37,471
make this push based on
Hacktoberfest and DigitalOcean

581
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,016
cause they do this thing and
it's very fun, you know? And

582
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,561
it's,

583
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:43,112
it's cool to get the challenge
completed if you want. But, uh,

584
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:47,521
it's also. Like we've said on
both sides of the, you know, uh,

585
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:51,811
on both sides of it. It's people
spending their free time working

586
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,221
on other things for free. So
it's all good, you know? Um,

587
00:28:56,821 --> 00:29:00,332
Bekah: probably do one in, too.

588
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:03,662
Dan: uh, July, hacktober. Well,
we'd have to come up with a

589
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:04,172
different name,

590
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,031
Bekah: Yeah. I'm sure,

591
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:08,902
Kirk: Jul-Ober

592
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:12,932
Bekah: this is why, so it's so,
because, so it's so popular now.

593
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:14,986
It can be really hard to find
good issues because they just

594
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,981
get

595
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:22,051
taken so quickly. that's one of
the biggest frustrations I see

596
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,741
with a lot of people who are new
to open source. mean, we need

597
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:31,051
somebody who will, will back the
t-shirts and the sticker packs

598
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:33,457
and mail them because we all
know that I will not mail them

599
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,832
and

600
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:43,250
forbidden for mailing things,
Then then there's less of a, I

601
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,230
don't, maybe there's just
different months for

602
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,760
Hacktoberfest, right? This month
is devoted to contributors or

603
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,445
first-time contributors. And
this month is devoted for

604
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:55,130
someone who

605
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:57,485
has been a developer for a
while, hasn't contributed

606
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:59,839
before. I

607
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,560
don't know, like breaking it
down. So it seems less of like a

608
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,701
race to get things done because
I felt the same, Kirk. I really

609
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:09,906
wanted to make some, what I felt
were meaningful contributions

610
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:12,111
and

611
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:15,185
didn't get there and I still
want to, but it was just, you

612
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,509
know,

613
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,861
trying to support other people.
And then I think I spent an hour

614
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,045
and a half, one day looking at
issues. I'm like, okay. I just,

615
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,229
I

616
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,471
don't, I don't have time an app
to look for an issue for an hour

617
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:27,891
and a half.

618
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,681
Kirk: Yeah, I think that's, you
know, it in the, in the vein of

619
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,740
takeaways, that is the thing
that I think as a community, as

620
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,799
a tech

621
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,980
community, we underestimate it's
again, just find an issue and

622
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,911
grab it. That's not, that's a
non-trivial process, you know,

623
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,250
unless. You are fortunate to
have not to like, know someone

624
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,589
was

625
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,861
like, Hey, here's a great issue.
And they like, you know, hand it

626
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,590
to you, but even then you still
have to familiarize yourself.

627
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,681
Like it's still an entire
software project. And if it's

628
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:02,351
open source, it's like you know,
like a meaningful software

629
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:04,421
project, like it's doing a real
thing, but you have to

630
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,085
familiarize yourself with it's
someone else's work and no

631
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,749
matter

632
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,310
how much we say you do want to
do a good job. So, you know, and

633
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,170
that just takes And I think it
takes time in a way that, like,

634
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,030
I

635
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,980
feel like it's very difficult to
say, okay, I'm going to work on

636
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,690
this PR and I'm going to do 10
minutes every day. Like, it's

637
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,400
not

638
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,631
like meditation. Like you
probably, you know, it's like,

639
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:26,861
is

640
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,941
going to take me a couple of
hours to sit with this problem

641
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:35,500
and then some time to make the
solution and then to get the PR.

642
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:39,865
Um, and I don't know if there's
a good solution for that. I

643
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,299
think

644
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,323
in our community. We did a lot
of consolidation, which I liked

645
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:49,346
a

646
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,671
lot of people are like, Hey,
this Repo seems to have some

647
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,996
good

648
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:58,556
resources and we would get that
all in a central place. Um, and

649
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:00,895
then of course, you know, like
we, are people in the

650
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:03,806
organization who have
repositories and, you know, can

651
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,110
like, keep, you can say like,
Hey, do you have an issue? And

652
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,414
we

653
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:08,695
can make sure you get, I'll make
sure there's one for you. And

654
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:11,681
that's, that's a nice way to,
but I don't know if that is

655
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,276
scalable

656
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:19,766
to the larger OSS initiative.
Um, we still run to run into the

657
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:26,576
issues of what does newbie mean?
Is it just to open source? Is it

658
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:33,865
new to programming? Is it to the
Git commit to PR life cycle? And

659
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:39,026
where does that fall? Uh, so
yeah, it's, it's, complex and

660
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:43,395
it's, it's hard and everyone is
trying, but I do. And do you

661
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:52,006
think that maybe trying to do of
that in the 30 days is it's a

662
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:58,246
challenge. Um, and I, you know,
I'm even thinking it's like

663
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:01,270
September for, for
Hacktoberfest, like maybe where,

664
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,214
there's like a

665
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,465
bunch of different preps. I
would almost want to do the

666
00:33:06,465 --> 00:33:08,715
maintainer

667
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:13,096
stuff like a month or two, even
before that, you know, like a,

668
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:15,945
Hey, do you want to be a
maintainer for project? And we

669
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:17,850
just spend a month getting
people like set up there and we

670
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,755
talk

671
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:24,046
about like healthy patterns and
schedules the docs up to date.

672
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,405
And because I could spend a
month just working on good

673
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,895
issues. And

674
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,026
I think that's what I maybe
wanted, like next time. And next

675
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:36,405
time I need to take an entire
month with my projects. Like my

676
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:42,385
job is just every few days or
once a week. write some more

677
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,530
fluid issues, because I think
for the maintainer, that is

678
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,464
probably

679
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:49,315
the largest time sink. It's just
having the good issues

680
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:52,165
available.

681
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,676
And then you can spend the
actual month kind of focused on

682
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:58,256
getting

683
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:01,645
people over the finish line, but
you have enough time to get

684
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:05,155
reviews and ask for help and get
some feedback. So, you know,

685
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:07,226
like, Hey, I'm, I'm ready to go.

686
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,181
Bekah: Yeah, it does seem like
having a whole open source

687
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:20,900
quarter of the year would make
sense to develop those skills. I

688
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,380
like it.

689
00:34:22,606 --> 00:34:31,195
Kirk: hack order year. No, we
can workshop that.

690
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,601
Bekah: If anybody has
suggestions, you can email us at

691
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:35,530
podcast@virtualcoffee.io.

692
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,796
Dan: Yeah. I mean, writing
issues takes forever. That's the

693
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:40,326
other,

694
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:41,795
I mean, it is the other problem.
I spent hours writing issues

695
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,205
for,

696
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:48,545
just for our site. And I think
over the two months, you know, I

697
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:50,415
probably wrote 20 issues and
they all took a long time. They

698
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:52,265
all

699
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:55,775
got done or, you know, or in the
process of being done. Uh, but

700
00:34:55,775 --> 00:35:00,036
that's still just 20, you know,
and we had, I mean, we had lots

701
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:01,146
of people wanting to involved
in...

702
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:01,971
Bekah: What are the stats?

703
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:06,155
Dan: Oh, well, so I was, I was,
yeah, I know. W w we, uh, I

704
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:10,376
thought about that. We didn't,
but then, um, might as well, I

705
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,235
mean, like I have this, I have
this pulled up, so now it would

706
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,876
be a good time we could do a
little Hacktoberfest, uh,

707
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:20,456
results. So we, so for Virtual
Coffee members, right, we had a

708
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:25,615
hundred members sign up, um,
including contributors and, um,

709
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:32,065
mentors and maintainers. And of
those a hundred, at least 66

710
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:36,206
members had merged at least one
pull request, uh, in October and

711
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:39,700
collectively, uh, merged 336
pull requests across 129

712
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,714
different

713
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:45,985
repositories in the month of
October. And that's just our

714
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:49,525
members, um, which is just
incredible. I am like still

715
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,166
astounded by it. Um, and you
know, some of those, like, I

716
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:56,876
didn't, this is not checking
against Hacktoberfest, you know,

717
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,756
rules or whatever. And, you
know, I know. There are some

718
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:02,186
that can

719
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:03,565
be, you know, probably emerged
in November with still counting

720
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:04,944
and

721
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:08,005
all that stuff. So there's
probably even more, um, as to

722
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:13,706
say, um, on, on the Virtual
Coffee IO site, which is an

723
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:16,735
open-source project. And, you
know, I, I was sort of leading,

724
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:19,495
maintaining this month. Uh,
well, in October, um, we had 81

725
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:22,255
poll

726
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:24,340
requests merged, uh, in the
month of October. And so 50 of

727
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,425
those

728
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,706
are, um, you know, we had our
new like member profiles set up.

729
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,896
And

730
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,956
so members could either add or
update them their, you know,

731
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:35,486
their information on our sites.
So 50 of those or those, and

732
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,016
then

733
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:41,936
we have 31, um, pull requests
that were, uh, not that new

734
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,795
features or fixes and all of
that stuff. And, uh, that also

735
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:45,654
is just

736
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:47,590
a enormous number and it's, it's
really cool. Uh, very, very

737
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,525
cool.

738
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:55,376
Um, a you had, so you had like
four, I think four different

739
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:59,545
issues merged or pull requests
merged in, um, October. She did

740
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:02,186
some really good accessibility
work. Todd Libby also did some

741
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,510
good accessibility features. So
our site is, uh, I don't know,

742
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,834
it

743
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:08,410
has vastly improved
accessibility features now, um,

744
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,955
which is

745
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:15,115
awesome. Um, Abbey hit did a
really cool style update that

746
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:17,516
I've been wanting to do for a
very long time. And I very

747
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:19,796
appreciate that. Uh, Matt
McInnis actually did. Good, uh,

748
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:22,076
tooling

749
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,626
updates for us added prettier,
which I've been also wanting to

750
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:28,795
do for a long time. Um, and that
was a huge pull request cause he

751
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:32,005
basically formatted the entire,
every file in the whole site.

752
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,795
And, uh, he worked with like, we
worked together for a long time

753
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,635
and he was very patient with me
cause I get picky with some

754
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:42,235
things and uh, and it was great
and he added some, uh, some

755
00:37:42,235 --> 00:37:45,476
other, some BS code stuff, uh,
which was really cool. Um, and

756
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:49,106
yeah, and we had, we had a bunch
of other different, um, kind of

757
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:51,626
features and fixes and
documentation updates and you

758
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,626
know, our content, a lot of our
content is in Git Hub. So there

759
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:57,445
was, uh, people doing writing
for us or, you know, updating

760
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:59,155
documentation. Um, that was
really cool. So, you know, I

761
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,865
feel

762
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:04,856
like we succeeded both as a
community for the, you know,

763
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,061
general Virtual Coffee, uh,
Hacktoberfest initiative. Uh,

764
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:09,206
and

765
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,846
also as, you know, as a, as a
maintainer of this project, you

766
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:15,985
know, it, it, we. made a lot of
progress and it was really cool.

767
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,281
So I was excited about that.
This is a fun month. It's a lot

768
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:20,396
of

769
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:21,940
work. Uh that's 81 pull requests
that, you know, we had merged

770
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,484
and

771
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:27,655
all that stuff. So it's good
stuff. So that was our sort of

772
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:29,876
high-level summary.

773
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:34,226
Kirk: Yeah. And I think in
addition, uh, this month was

774
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:35,996
just

775
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:39,865
really awesome in terms of the
community I've been supporting

776
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:43,806
each other. We got heavy use of
Hacktoberfest coworking room.

777
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,035
Heavy use out of Help and
Pairing just a lot of people

778
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,779
being

779
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,945
willing to help each other out
on set ups and installs had a

780
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:56,110
lot of

781
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,670
good questions are being
answered by people in the

782
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,230
community. It

783
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:02,471
was just like very, just all
around a team effort, I think

784
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:06,145
really good to see. So, you
know, was, that was great. If we

785
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:09,819
could

786
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:15,731
just do that in tech everywhere,
you know, It'd be kinda cool.

787
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:19,186
Dan: I mean, agreed. It's it
does bring into focus, all this

788
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:21,541
stuff

789
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,271
we've been talking about, you
know, how, how much kind of

790
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:28,710
support can be needed, you know,
especially to get started, but

791
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:32,621
it's good stuff. It was a good,
it was a good month. It

792
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:39,201
Kirk: As we do hacked order,
there'll be even cooler.

793
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:45,281
Dan: Hack Fest Corder. Um,
Bekah, do you want to talk a

794
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:50,751
little bit

795
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:52,791
about what we're doing this
month?

796
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,291
Bekah: Yeah, sure. So this is
this marks one year of monthly

797
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:03,380
challenges. So November, we came
off a Hacktoberfest and we were

798
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,130
like, let's start doing monthly
challenges have lightning talks,

799
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:10,550
was an ex. We were very
exhausted after that month. So

800
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,919
this, this

801
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,251
year, you're not doing lightning
talks in November, but we are

802
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:18,440
continuing with monthly
challenges and we're doing the

803
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,855
same one that we started off
with last year, which is

804
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:23,270
national

805
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,936
novel writing month. We talked
about this and Jessica's

806
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,601
episode,

807
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:29,510
but all working together to
where our goal was 50,000 words

808
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,419
to

809
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,740
write in our tech blogs and hit
50,000 words. we are past that

810
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,001
point today is November 15th.
we're halfway through the month

811
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:43,986
and we have surpassed our goal.
And so we upped it to, I think,

812
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,581
a

813
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:48,010
hundred thousand now right?

814
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,860
Dan: Yeah, it's the first that's
strech goal one 50, a a hundred

815
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,425
thousand. So. We, yeah, we hit
our challenge, I think on the

816
00:40:56,425 --> 00:40:59,295
12th or the 13th, something like
that. We had, we had,

817
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:00,888
Bekah: According to Friday, we
hadn't hit it yet. Cause I

818
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,430
posted

819
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:05,581
in slack and I said, who who's
writing? Can we get to 50,000 by

820
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:07,861
Monday? And it was before,
before today that we hit it, but

821
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:10,141
it's

822
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:14,130
just been so fun to watch the
monthly challenges. Some of them

823
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:20,041
have worked out really well and
been great. Others have not. Um,

824
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,080
but the nice thing is, you know,
some of those monthly

825
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,700
challenges.

826
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:28,045
We're scrambling at the end of
the month, last year to try and

827
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,295
get something together. Cause it
was new to us and we were trying

828
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:34,465
to figure out how can we make
something that everyone can

829
00:41:34,465 --> 00:41:37,150
participate in at any stage of
their tech journey. And so

830
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,835
trying

831
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:46,076
to make it open to everybody and
have folks be interested. Um,

832
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:50,936
sometimes it just difficult to
do, but now we have a solid set

833
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:52,601
of challenges that we'll go
ahead and repeat, and we're

834
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,266
working on

835
00:41:54,266 --> 00:42:00,025
this cycle of what that should
look like. So I'm really excited

836
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:05,786
to see how these play out in the
next year as we go through 11

837
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:09,746
more challenges and see how we
can get the community involved

838
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:12,565
and get them excited. Obviously
they're excited about this one.

839
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:15,746
They were excited last month we
did use Hacktoberfest as our

840
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:20,815
monthly challenge. and so we're
going on a string of a lot of

841
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:22,810
people being really excited
about the things that we're

842
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,805
doing. And,

843
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:28,436
you know, Kirk, you you've been,
you've put a ton of time and

844
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:31,826
effort into the monthly
challenges too. So are you

845
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:33,235
excited about?

846
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:39,757
Kirk: So many beings, uh, it's
just nice to be, I think in it's

847
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,271
nice to have the comparison
data. I feel like 2020 was a lot

848
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,785
of

849
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:46,567
what guests were doing this, you
know?

850
00:42:46,572 --> 00:42:47,561
Bekah: Structured yellow.

851
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:51,666
Kirk: Yeah. Sort of like, uh, I
guess I'm a member of this

852
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,496
community. Oh no. Am I a
maintainer? Well

853
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,192
Bekah: Just kept pulling you in
for more.

854
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:02,356
Kirk: also, yeah, like this time
when you're like, Hey, should we

855
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:06,527
do the lightning talks again
after Hacktoberfest? And we were

856
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:10,336
like, no, no, we should not
because we have learned lessons

857
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:11,297
from the last time.

858
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,282
Bekah: Yup. We learned them.

859
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:18,677
Kirk: Um, yeah. So, you know, I,
it's nice to have like a year

860
00:43:18,677 --> 00:43:23,746
feedback. Right. We have a year
of challenge feedback. Um, you

861
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:32,177
know, we have a cast of VC
members who are now also

862
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:35,447
supporting us on these. Right.
Um, and know, I'm looking

863
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,717
forward

864
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,282
to, we get, as we get towards
the end of the year and just,

865
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:43,847
you

866
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:48,556
know, just like going back and
appreciating all the stuff that

867
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:51,256
we've done, because I think
we've done a lot and I think

868
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,956
that you

869
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:56,011
know like the real spirit kind
of like started all this is

870
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,066
still

871
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:01,832
here and still strong Um but
also a good chance to you know

872
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:05,597
like

873
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:07,516
take stock and go okay like what
did work and why what didn't

874
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:09,286
work

875
00:44:09,286 --> 00:44:12,331
and why and you can maybe you
know like let's we can get

876
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:15,376
better

877
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:16,516
at things And I think that's
what I'm excited about You know

878
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:17,656
like

879
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:19,246
even with this time
Hacktoberfest it's like okay

880
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:20,806
well we know what

881
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,336
went right The last time we said
Hey what went right Let's do

882
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:23,866
more

883
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:25,266
of that You know And we were
like Hey what was a little

884
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,665
wonkie It's

885
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:27,916
like well let's see if we can
shore that up And then it gets

886
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,146
to

887
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:33,047
that again So each time we get
sort of like better and better

888
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:36,136
and know we spend most of our
time going ah this is tomorrow

889
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:38,716
Ah

890
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:43,666
and all the time know going ah
what are we going to do in three

891
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,466
months Ah it's the same energy
just like a different a

892
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,266
different

893
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,526
timeframe And so hopefully by
the end of it you know we're

894
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:51,786
just

895
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:56,836
like flying at 10 miles an hour
instead of like frantically

896
00:44:56,836 --> 00:44:59,356
running at a hundred miles an
hour, you know, just the

897
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,711
Dan: It's obviously the better,
yeah. The better situation to

898
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:02,850
be,

899
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:04,126
Kirk: way better.

900
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:12,277
Bekah: Maybe, maybe captures
something deeper.

901
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:15,371
Dan: uh, real quick. I just
wanted to shout out, you know,

902
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:19,961
Kirk mentioned having help with
monthly challenges and, uh, two

903
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:23,141
of our members Aurelie and um,
Andrew had been leading, so we

904
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:24,536
created a month of challenge
team and, um, they've been doing

905
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:25,931
a lot

906
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,572
of work helping the same with
the, with the same thing,

907
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:32,472
helping, uh, plan and, uh, and
execute these challenges for the

908
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:34,542
last I don't, I don't know how
long, a few months, at least,

909
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,612
uh,

910
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,731
and it's been, it has been, it's
been really awesome to have, um,

911
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:43,726
community members, you know,
excited about. Creating, you

912
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:47,806
know, helping create these and
brainstorm and do all the work

913
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:48,796
that goes involved. You know,
like all the work that's

914
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:49,786
involved

915
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:52,816
with, uh, putting these together
and, you know, it's been neat.

916
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,846
So

917
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,496
I just wanted to say, thanks
real quick

918
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:03,367
Kirk: Yeah. I mean, even kind of
beyond the challenges, just

919
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:10,791
having. This expanded group. I
think of community members who I

920
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:15,052
can, like we can rely on for
feedback, for support and

921
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:20,512
encouragement for just like
really solid insights, you know?

922
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:23,001
Um, I know for all of us,
there's a people just like, oh,

923
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:24,861
you know,

924
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,826
I need to talk to I ain't talk
to that person. They're always

925
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,790
like

926
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,221
there and they always have great
advice And, you know, I feel

927
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,591
like

928
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:40,822
even where the community is now
is as much a result. Uh, you

929
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:42,891
know, those people as it is
like, you know, like we're just,

930
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:44,960
job is

931
00:46:44,961 --> 00:46:47,751
to just like, get the good
advice and, you know, maybe like

932
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:52,161
condense it and maybe make some
priorities, but, uh, that's been

933
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:56,632
a big help. And I think like a
big relief, I, I, none of this

934
00:46:56,632 --> 00:46:58,096
would be happening. I think if I
didn't know, like, oh, I can

935
00:46:58,096 --> 00:46:59,560
turn

936
00:46:59,572 --> 00:47:06,516
to, to these folks and really...
be with a group of people who

937
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:10,117
have the same interests that I
do, which is just like making

938
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:15,306
this community as awesome, a
place as possible. So this also

939
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:20,586
feels like the year that more
than before. And it's awesome.

940
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,851
Bekah: Yeah. And going along
with what both of, you said,

941
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,516
Kirk, you

942
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:29,237
were talking about feedback
earlier and you know, we've,

943
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:31,191
we've been working on feedback,
but it's one of those things

944
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:33,085
that

945
00:47:33,456 --> 00:47:37,936
I know that I have to I have to
deliberately make time for it

946
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:46,847
because feels like I like moving
forward quickly and sometimes

947
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:51,556
stopping to do retros. Like that
can be hard because it doesn't

948
00:47:51,556 --> 00:47:54,159
feel like. Moving forward and
taking the time to do that

949
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:56,762
really

950
00:47:56,762 --> 00:48:01,501
ensures that you have the energy
to continue moving and helps you

951
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,901
focus on the other people who
are on your team and thinking

952
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:06,301
about

953
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:10,442
like, okay, well, you know, how
can I better support people to

954
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,802
doing more of these things or to
contribute in ways that are

955
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:18,121
meaningful to them? And so, you
know, moving forward over the

956
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:22,061
next, you know, 11 or 12 months,
just really trying to make sure

957
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:27,842
that, I take the time to do that
something that I don't know that

958
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:34,501
I would say I'm excited for it,
but I am, I am happy to be

959
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:36,887
building that into part of my
own process, you know, to make

960
00:48:36,887 --> 00:48:39,032
sure

961
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:42,271
that we continue to support the
people who have supported us.

962
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:43,726
Dan: For sure.

963
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,840
Kirk: I am very proud to say
that a significant portion of

964
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,110
the

965
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,720
people who like plan these
events and help out in this

966
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,330
community

967
00:48:56,481 --> 00:49:02,300
have ADHD or, you know, like
there's a, we're a big narrative

968
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:05,885
first group, I think. And, and
we make it work and we, you

969
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:09,439
know,

970
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:12,501
try and focus on our strengths
and we encourage each other when

971
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:17,420
we're having like the not great
brain days. So. Yeah, we should

972
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,900
write a book about no, we should
not. We are not qualified.

973
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:21,931
Dan: Don't say that. she can
hear that.

974
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,971
Bekah: It's NaNoWriMo. We've got
two weeks left.

975
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:25,820
Kirk: Listen,

976
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:32,760
Bekah: can all together. We've
got this. Everybody could just

977
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,420
write a hundred words

978
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,630
Dan: yeah, it's a lightning talk
book

979
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,920
Bekah: we can inspired by Ray's
morning pages. If everybody

980
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,391
writes morning pages

981
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,420
Dan: Bekah. Bekah making, you're
a lightning talk book. This is

982
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,780
what you're doing.

983
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:43,871
Kirk: yeah

984
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,291
Dan: we agreed. not to do this
November.

985
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:47,650
Bekah: No

986
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:48,690
Kirk: a really passive
aggresive.

987
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,161
Bekah: We agreed not to do
Lightning talks. We didn't agree

988
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:53,530
not to write a lightning talk
book.

989
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:54,432
Dan: tryin to work her way
around rules You write the first

990
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:55,270
half,

991
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:58,690
I'll write the other half C no,
I shouldn't even say that. then

992
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,271
Brian healing thing, everything
is a challenge. I was going to

993
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,880
say what we should be really
passive, aggressive. Like when

994
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,050
wikipedia was doing like their
funding drive, where it's like,

995
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,681
do you know, you could just give
me $3, like, you've been using

996
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,865
this thing for like a decade. If
you just give me $3. You

997
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,020
garbage,

998
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:22,280
you know, well, you write 140
characters, you know, like 10

999
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,701
times a day in your tweets, you
can give me a hundred words. be

1000
00:50:25,701 --> 00:50:27,861
like that. And then no one would
talk to us. Don't say that was

1001
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,021
a,

1002
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,490
that was an example of what not
to do

1003
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:37,240
Bekah: Going to use that.

1004
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:38,650
Dan: Um,

1005
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:40,300
Bekah: Oh,

1006
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:41,650
Dan: good

1007
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,405
Kirk: For those listening. We
wonder what our planning

1008
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:45,100
meetings

1009
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:46,706
are like, can we usually
schedule an hour? And it takes

1010
00:50:46,706 --> 00:50:48,311
about 20

1011
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,951
minutes to get this out.

1012
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,451
Dan: Yeah.

1013
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:55,780
Bekah: I feel like we've gotten
better at it. Or at least one

1014
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,681
person will always be okay. You
know, actually we haven't had a

1015
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,710
planning meeting in a while.
that's why.

1016
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,630
Kirk: It's only because like at
least one person has like a

1017
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,380
followup meeting.

1018
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:09,400
Dan: We've all just gotten
busier as I think the problem

1019
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,525
is. So

1020
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:11,885
there's more deadlines.

1021
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,530
Bekah: Well, I mean, we do a
really good job of async

1022
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,400
communication for the most part.
And so we're all, um, we have

1023
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,521
pretty good processes and
structures that are in place to

1024
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:28,121
allow us to do that and to know
like somebody's care of that or

1025
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,710
somebody else's on top of this
other thing. And, um, so it's,

1026
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,370
we, we are very good at being a
remote and async team like to

1027
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,820
put

1028
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,360
that out there.

1029
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:43,410
Kirk: We do not have a choice
though. I mean, and this year

1030
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,005
has

1031
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:50,146
been, I mean, first of all, as
one of my coworkers said, the

1032
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:56,686
last two years have been weird.
Um, but it has been a pretty big

1033
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:59,400
year of change for the
community. So many people

1034
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,114
transitioning to

1035
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:07,775
new roles in their life,
professional and otherwise, and

1036
00:52:07,786 --> 00:52:11,871
it really has like a lot of
people who've been in. New

1037
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:15,260
ventures. Um, and we've all like
tried and not just the

1038
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,410
maintainers, but like everyone
is sort of like try to be

1039
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,560
present

1040
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:21,891
and still be supportive, even
through all these things

1041
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:25,701
happening, which, you know, we
also do appreciate, you know, a

1042
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:26,841
lot of members have been, you
know, they'll reach out and

1043
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:27,981
like,

1044
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,630
Hey, I haven't been around a
while. It's not because I've

1045
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,780
forgotten. I've just been doing
this. I'm like, it's okay. You

1046
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,650
know, you should, um, settle
into your new job. You should

1047
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,520
take

1048
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,271
care of the new baby, you know,
but like, that's, that's okay.

1049
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:48,141
You know, we're, we're here and,
you know, it's, it's, it's a

1050
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:52,280
place where people are always,
um, happy for your achievements

1051
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,561
and then, and when you get to
make it back. We're always happy

1052
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:57,101
to see you. So it's cool. Super

1053
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,431
Bekah: I feel like there's a,
this is, this is a hot topic for

1054
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:06,860
me right now, but I think that
there's such a focus on, people

1055
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,695
providing support to large
groups and people that have a

1056
00:53:09,695 --> 00:53:12,530
hundred

1057
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:17,871
thousand. Followers or members
or, or whatever. And I really

1058
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:22,190
think that the impact that gets
made in tech that gets passed on

1059
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,371
that gets rippled through the
industry, happens in small

1060
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:30,320
groups. it makes me mad. Anytime
somebody says, oh, you know, why

1061
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,521
would we give support to a small
group? Because we don't get the

1062
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:38,960
same audience. you, you get much
more than that audience, right?

1063
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,561
You get every person that was
affected by that community who

1064
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:46,911
goes out into the tech community
and spreads that same positivity

1065
00:53:46,971 --> 00:53:52,280
and empathetic approach and
support. And I think that if

1066
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,751
you're looking to make change
with your, with your support,

1067
00:53:56,751 --> 00:54:00,471
with your money, whatever, then
you find those communities that

1068
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:06,771
are doing good intimate group
development, support, that kind

1069
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:13,530
of stuff. And that's where the
impact is made. That's my hot

1070
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:13,641
take.

1071
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:13,811
Kirk: Yeah.

1072
00:54:14,155 --> 00:54:17,905
Dan: yeah. I agree. And it like,
the we've talked about this

1073
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:22,315
before, and this is like our, we
have stuck pretty strongly with

1074
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:26,545
this, with that exact mentality.
You know, the, the word audience

1075
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:30,925
is something we, we never, ever
used, never even think to use,

1076
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:33,326
you know, with, with Virtual
Coffee stuff. Right. Cause we

1077
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:36,565
don't, I don't know. It's not
that sort of thing. And that's

1078
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:40,286
it, there's a lot of community
resources, right. That are based

1079
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:42,220
from that standpoint of all of
these people are an audience,

1080
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,154
you

1081
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,885
know, or followers or whatever.
Right. That's not us.

1082
00:54:48,106 --> 00:54:49,936
Bekah: Yeah. Yeah. The there's
an article. I'll post it in the

1083
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:51,766
show

1084
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:54,615
notes. I'll find it. But the one
of the first lines was the

1085
00:54:54,615 --> 00:54:56,130
difference between the community
and audience is the way the

1086
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,645
chair

1087
00:54:57,646 --> 00:55:01,235
is facing. And I thought that
did a really nice job of kind of

1088
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,275
framing are they just are all
the chairs facing you. Are you

1089
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:05,315
on a

1090
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:07,865
platform where people are
listening to you? Is there

1091
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:10,355
engagement you know, like to
talk about the coffee table

1092
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:12,845
method of

1093
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,606
Virtual Coffee, like we're all
sitting around a table together.

1094
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:20,106
Everybody is equal in the room.
has the opportunity to talk and

1095
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:25,085
participate. It's not me talking
at you or you talking at me and,

1096
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:26,856
that is that's how change is
made,

1097
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,805
Dan: Except for if you're
sitting and listening to this

1098
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:29,750
podcast

1099
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:33,525
Kirk: I mean, in this moment,
right now you in the audience,

1100
00:55:33,635 --> 00:55:36,115
Right now, as soon as the
podcast is over then, like

1101
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,666
Bekah: everybody's invited to
come to virtual

1102
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:45,811
Dan: I was just joking. Uh, no,
it is. And that's the thing that

1103
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:48,610
makes Virtual Coffee, you know?
Good. And this is the reason I.

1104
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:53,340
So much as the, is that fact,
right? It's not something that,

1105
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,415
um, that any of us are talking
at, you know, so it's good

1106
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,490
stuff.

1107
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:06,376
Kirk: And I think even the
freedom sometimes too, sometimes

1108
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:08,910
it can be very freeing to
listen, you know, and you know,

1109
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,444
a lot of

1110
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:13,950
members. Some days you don't
want to chat, you know, you

1111
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,455
don't want

1112
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,815
to be sort of like the center
it's just nice to, I'm just

1113
00:56:19,815 --> 00:56:21,645
gonna, I just want to hang out
in this room. I just want to

1114
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,475
listen

1115
00:56:23,476 --> 00:56:27,436
to my friends. They just want to
like cue the voices, um, happens

1116
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:30,525
in the co-working room as well.
You know, sometimes people just

1117
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:31,680
pop in. They're like, Hey, I
got, you know, I'm about to do.

1118
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,835
We

1119
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:34,155
just want to pop in and say hi
to my friends. You know, there's

1120
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:35,475
no,

1121
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:39,510
that's not a, there's no real
way to monetize hellos, I'm sure

1122
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:42,674
as I

1123
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:45,766
say, this is probably some like
hello dot JS, which

1124
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:51,885
revolutionizing the way we send
audi-whatever, but you know, um,

1125
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:52,965
yeah.

1126
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:54,475
Bekah: Oh, Hey. There's no.
Hello dot JS. So you better grab

1127
00:56:54,475 --> 00:56:55,885
that

1128
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:56,576
up real quick.

1129
00:56:57,376 --> 00:57:02,536
Kirk: Ooh. Um, Roger Gentry, if
you're listening, Roger will

1130
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:05,085
instantly get that domain for
us. we ask

1131
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:12,735
Bekah: Um, wait. I'm I might be
lying. Actually. I take it back

1132
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,486
there. There may be a hello dot
JS package. I'm not sure what

1133
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:19,096
you

1134
00:57:19,096 --> 00:57:23,965
use it for, so somebody else can
explore that. Sorry. What a

1135
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:27,255
dissappointing way to end the
episode. Should I read a dad

1136
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:28,876
joke? Is that a better way to

1137
00:57:29,465 --> 00:57:32,476
Kirk: alright, alright. one dad,
one dad joke

1138
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:32,766
Bekah: joke?

1139
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:35,525
Kirk: what a good one. got to
be.

1140
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,583
Bekah: no. Uh, Sorry, just
trying to find the best one.

1141
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,960
There's so

1142
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,842
much pressure now. Um, uh,

1143
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:48,952
Kirk: for those of your who...

1144
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:49,902
Bekah: here we go.

1145
00:57:50,302 --> 00:57:50,621
Kirk: oh?

1146
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:54,501
Bekah: Why should you avoid the
restaurant on the moon?

1147
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:56,282
Dan: Why?

1148
00:57:58,302 --> 00:57:59,382
Bekah: You don't even wanna
think about it.

1149
00:58:00,596 --> 00:58:04,496
Dan: if it's a joke, is it a
joke or a riddle? I mean, I was

1150
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:05,576
supposed to solve it or

1151
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:09,601
Bekah: You try and solve it?

1152
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:11,865
Dan: Like trying jokes with my
kids, don't understand

1153
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:14,046
Kirk: tech hiring situation.
This is the questions. And if

1154
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:16,205
you get

1155
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:20,106
it right, you get to move on to
round 14 of 37.

1156
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:26,135
Dan: Uh, I'm out.

1157
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:29,581
Bekah: because it doesn't have a
good atmosphere.

1158
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:31,786
Kirk: We really

1159
00:58:31,936 --> 00:58:34,626
Bekah: you put me on spot?
Really? I had

1160
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:39,737
Kirk: This one was on me. I, I
encourage this. We stayed in the

1161
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:40,106
boat.

1162
00:58:40,106 --> 00:58:42,916
Bekah: Where does Bruce Wayne go
to use the toilet?

1163
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:48,686
Dan: Now, I don't know if I'm
supposed to solve it or am I

1164
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:49,376
supposed to just

1165
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:50,237
Bekah: I mean, I

1166
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:51,565
Dan: where I say, don't know
what,

1167
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:55,836
Bekah: it. I guess I do jokes
wrong, to the bat room

1168
00:58:58,226 --> 00:58:59,246
Dan: oh,

1169
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:00,867
Kirk: We can edit all of this
out

1170
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:06,293
Dan: you guys, I gotta go man.

1171
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:07,362
Bekah: Well,

1172
00:59:09,802 --> 00:59:10,313
Dan: This is good.
